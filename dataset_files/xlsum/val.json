He said her replacement was not a result of the Assange case.\n\nBut foreign ministry sources in Quito told BBC News that various high-ranking officials had repeatedly expressed profound dissatisfaction over her work.\n\nThey say Ms Alban was seen as\"ill-suited for her position\"and was considered unable to bring an end to the long-running diplomatic impasse. \n\nWanted for questioning\n\nSome observers argued that Ms Alban's replacement may also mean a shift in Ecuador's strategy in the Assange saga.\n\nMr Assange entered Ecuador's embassy in London last June asking for asylum. \n\nHe did so to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him over allegations of rape and sexual assault. \n\nThe Australian anti-secrecy campaigner, who denies wrongdoing, fears that if he is sent to Sweden, he may be extradited to the US, where he could face the death penalty for disclosing confidential government information.\n\nHis decision to seek refuge in Ecuador's embassy caught many international observers by surprise, raising questions about why the Andean country would be interested in protecting him.\n\nSources told the BBC negotiations had been ongoing for months and that Ecuadorean authorities in London already knew Mr Assange would soon become their guest.  \n\nYet, it took the Ecuadorean government two months to make its position official. \n\nOn 16 August, Mr Patino announced Mr Assange would be granted asylum. \n\nThis meant that Mr Assange would avoid British arrest and deportation to Sweden if he stayed in the Ecuadorean embassy. Any attempt to leave would result in his arrest. \n\nLimited experience\n\nWhile the Assange case gave Ecuador a high profile, it also put the country in a delicate diplomatic position.\n\nSo far Ecuador has tried to negotiate safe conduct with the UK government so Mr Assange can leave the embassy without being arrested. But the UK insists it is legally obliged to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.\n\n\"This is a complex case in which the reputations of many countries are at stake,\"said Michel Levi, a foreign policy analyst at Quito's Simon Bolivar Andina University. \n\n\"Such a case required a more experienced diplomatic representation that could co-ordinate the situation better.\"\n\nMs Alban was named ambassador to London in 2010, when the UK was seen as marginal for Ecuador's foreign relations.\n\nSome US cables dating back to 2007, when President Rafael Correa took over and appointed Ms Alban as environment minister, suggest she was not an experienced political operator. \n\n\"Alban, who was appointed by previous President Alfred Palacio in 2005, was retained by President Correa. Although seemingly well-intentioned, she has been a weak and ineffectual minister under both Palacio and Correa,\"said a cable originating from the US embassy in Quito on 17 September 2007. \n\nEcuador's relations with Mr Assange have had ups and downs since his Wikileaks website first released US state department diplomatic cables in November 2010. \n\nAt the time, deputy Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas said Ecuador would grant him residency if needed. A few weeks later, Mr Patino and President Correa backtracked, saying Mr Lucas had spoken\"on his own behalf\".\n\nWarming to Wikileaks\n\nMr Correa spoke disparagingly of Wikileaks, saying it had\"committed an error by breaking the laws of the United States and leaking this type of information.\"\n\nBut things changed in 2011, when the Ecuadorean government reached an agreement with Mr Assange to declassify all the cables from the US Embassy in Quito. \n\nWikileaks had previously released the cables through El Comercio and El Universo, two opposition newspapers which Mr Correa thought were using them to further their own anti-government agenda. \n\nSources told BBC News that Fidel Narvaez, Ecuador's consul to London, was the mastermind behind the Wikileaks-Ecuador episode. \n\nMr Narvaez, a political activist who was made consul in 2010, is thought to have approached Mr Assange about the US cables.\n\nHe also mediated an interview between the Wikileaks founder and President Correa in April 2012.\n\nExit strategy\n\nThe 75-minute interview, broadcast on Russia Today, an English-language TV channel funded by the Moscow government, was a bonding moment for Mr Assange and the Ecuadorean president, who praised Wikileaks and its work.\n\nMr Assange's arrival at the embassy was no surprise for those at the foreign affairs ministry who already knew of Mr Narvaez's negotiations with Mr Assange. \n\nAt the same time Mr Narvaez, who is seen with suspicion by career diplomats for his radical politics, hoped to find fertile terrain in Mr Patino's hard line in foreign affairs.\n\nLast week Mr Patino announced the new ambassador would be Juan Falconi Puig, a lawyer criticised for his role in protecting private banks during the collapse of Ecuador's financial system in the late 1990s.  \n\nWith both the UK and Ecuador holding fast to their positions, it is difficult to see how there could be a quick exit strategy for Mr Assange.\n\nThe answer may

important part in his success.\n\n\"I was born in Carmarthen but I grew up just outside in Pontyberem in the Gwendraeth Valley,\"the 47-year-old explained.\n\n\"It was a close-knit farming and mining community and as such we all pulled together and helped each other.\n\n\"There were also some challenges for me.

Compared with our own Saturn, they would be very slightly smaller in radius and mass.\n\nThe planets orbit a star much like our own, more than 2,000 light-years away in the Lyra constellation.\n\n\"This is the first time we have been able to see a system in transit where there is more than one planet,\"Dr Holman said of the Kepler quest.\n\n\"I'd also say that what's particularly special about this system is that the variation in what we call the transit times is large enough - something that's been detected for the first time - to estimate the masses of these bodies.\"\n\nThe planets lie close in to their parent with the inner planet making roughly two revolutions for every one made by the outer object - approximately 19 days for Kepler-9b and 38 days for Kepler-9c.  \n\nThis resonance was one of the details that drew scientists' attention to the system, said Dr Holman, who is affiliated to the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, US.\n\n\"They're closer to their star than Mercury is to our Sun,\"he explained. \n\n\"It's quite common for transit surveys to find planets very close to their stars because that's the type of planet those surveys are most sensitive to finding.  So, on the scale of our Solar System, [these planets] are quite close but on the scale of what we know about a typical type of transiting system - these are relatively far out.\" \n\nIt was likely they formed much further from the parent star and then migrated inwards, he added.\n\n'Good news'\n\nThe third, unconfirmed object has a radius about 1.5 times that of Earth, which would put it in a category astronomers sometimes refer to as\"super-Earth\"because its mass would be several times that of our home planet.\n\nIt would take less than two Earth days to circle the star.\n\nCommenting on the Kepler news, Dr Alycia Weinberger, from the Carnegie Institution of Washington DC, said the observation that large migrating exoplanets took up resonant orbits augured well for the search for Earth-like objects.\n\n\"The resonances, such as the one between the'b' and'c' planets of Kepler-9 are very good for ensuring stability and making planetary systems last for billions of years,\"she told reporters.  \n\n\"If it turns out that planets are frequently driven to these resonant situations, it's probably good news for low-mass planets which will then find themselves in stable orbits where they can happily remain and not be ejected or be sent to burn up in their stars.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "output": "The US space agency's Kepler planet-hunter has spied a star that has two Saturn-sized objects circling it."}, {"input": "Captain Matthew Flinders is said to be buried underneath the London station. \n\nAustralia has about 200 statues dedicated to him but he is less well known in the UK.\n\nA campaign has been launched for a statue to be put on the railway station concourse.

Neither was successful. Obstacles were less about substance than politics.\n\nThe centre of Israeli politics has moved markedly to the right; the left that embraced the essential bargain of the Oslo process, land for peace, has receded. \n\nThe existing Israeli governing coalition is not wired to make concessions. In fact, it is pushing Mr Netanyahu to increase the settlement presence in the West Bank while accelerating construction in East Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2009, the Obama administration demanded a freeze to all settlement activity. Israel reluctantly agreed, although some growth continued within settlements Israel would keep in any final deal. \n\nRather than accelerate negotiations, settlements became a bone of contention within them. When the 10-month settlement moratorium ended, so did direct negotiations. \n\nSecretary of State John Kerry tried to achieve a framework agreement during Mr Obama's second term, but his one-year effort fell short. \n\nIn a parting shot at Israel, when a resolution came before the UN Security Council declaring settlement activity to be an impediment to peace, the Obama administration abstained.\n\nPresident Trump criticised the\"unfair and one-sided\"treatment of Israel at the UN, a gesture Mr Netanyahu welcomed. \n\nDays before the meeting, the Trump White House cautioned the Israeli government that expansion of settlements beyond their existing borders was not helpful.\n\nMr Netanyahu may moderate the current pace of settlement activity but he is not going to stop it. The Palestinians will continue to see settlement activity as a fundamental problem.\n\nThe Palestinians are deeply divided. In 2006, Hamas won an unexpected majority of seats in the Palestinian legislature over Mr Abbas' Fatah Party. The Palestinians have lacked political unity ever since. \n\nToday, Hamas, not the Palestinian Authority, is the de facto government in Gaza. Full elections have not been held in more than a decade. \n\nThe bottom line is that both sides prefer the status quo to making the politically painful concessions that a negotiation would require.\n\nBoth Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu hope to pursue an\"outside-in\"strategy, building on shared regional concern regarding Iran and radical extremists including the Islamic State group to create momentum to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nWhile reasonable in theory - Mr Netanyahu spoke of partnership with Arab states in opposition to Iran - co-operation at the governmental level does not necessarily translate to popular support. For many in the region, the plight of the Palestinians continues to resonate.\n\nGiven the limited prospects confronting a two-state solution - progress that likely requires different leaders and mandates on both sides - President Trump made a small, but significant adjustment in US policy, expressing a willingness to support a one-state solution if both parties agree.\n\nBut the two sides have very different visions of what a one-state solution looks like.\n\nA key Netanyahu prerequisite for any deal is preservation of Israel as a Jewish state. \n\nOn the other hand, in any agreement, Palestinians would insist on citizenship, voting rights and a government of and for the people - all of them. This could redefine Israel's identity. \n\nPresident Trump may see his one-state acknowledgement as the opening gambit in a lengthy negotiation. \n\nBut a one-state solution potentially presents Israel with an existential choice. It can be a Jewish state or a democracy, but not both. \n\nThat is a choice the United States has never wanted Israel to confront since the answer could have grave implications for the US-Israeli relationship.\n\nPJ Crowley is a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and now a Professor of Practice at The George Washington University and author of Red Line: American Foreign Policy in a Time of Fractured Politics and Failing States.", "output": "A playful exchange between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said a great deal about the dim prospects of a successful negotiation with the Palestinians under current circumstances."}, {"input": "The singer is seeking to ban the disclosure of details in journals kept by American businesswoman Gigi Lee.\n\nOn Friday, lawyers for Mr Morrison and the defendant, Associated Newspapers, told the High Court in Belfast that they had agreed to an adjournment in the case.\n\nAnother hearing was fixed for March.\n\nMs Lee reportedly died of cancer in a Belfast hospice in 2011 at the age of 44.\n\nShe had previously joined Mr Morrison in seeking court protection from media intrusion into their lives.\n\nIn April last year an injunction against the now-defunct News of the World was lifted.\n\nThat ban was set aside on the condition that the paper did not breach any privacy laws, and gave an undertaking not to publish descriptions or photographs of others linked to the case.\n\nIn an affidavit at the time, Mr Morrison set out how he regarded some parts of his life as areas to be kept away from scrutiny or comment.\n\nHe stated:\"I have made considerable efforts to protect my private life and I have refused to be interviewed about it, to comment on it publicly or to authorise others to do so, save in very limited circumstances when a bare minimum of information is required to prevent or minimise harm from the repeated attempts of others to publish allegations about my private life.\"", "output": "Van Morrison has launched a new legal bid to stop newspaper publication of information allegedly linked to his private life."}, {"input": "By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor \n\nThe Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a monthly survey of a panel of firms that tracks indicators such as new orders, employment and exports.\n\nIt showed that in May, construction had its fastest rate of growth in more than 10 years.\n\nHowever, that growth is coming off a low base, following a five-year slump.\n\nThe PMI data is produced by Ulster Bank.\n\nRichard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist in Northern Ireland, said the figure for construction indicates a period of\"catch-up from very low levels of activity\".\n\nHe pointed to the last official figures which showed that the number of new houses being built was still falling in the last quarter of 2013. \n\nNevertheless, he said it was \"encouraging\"that the pace  of business activity, new orders growth and job creation in the construction industry all increased at record rates last month. \n\nHe added that this  may signal \"a much needed upturn in the house building sector which is long overdue\".\n\nThe recession in Northern Ireland, which was exacerbated by the bursting of a property price bubble, has had the greatest impact on construction.\n\nThe output of the industry has shrunk by more than 25% since 2007 and about one in three jobs in the sector have been lost.", "output": "Recovery in the Northern Ireland construction industry is beginning to pick up pace, a survey of businesses has suggested."}, {"input": "Scottish Police Authority (SPA) members are currently appointed by the Scottish government.\n\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called for appointments to instead be made by the Scottish Parliament. \n\nIt follows the resignation of Chief Constable Phil Gormley on Wednesday.\n\nMr Gormley had been on special leave since September while investigations were carried out into a series of gross misconduct allegations against him.\n\nIt subsequently emerged that the SPA agreed in November to allow Mr Gormley -

The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. \n\n\"It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,\"says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  \n\nHe turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pok\u00e9mon that were exclusive to each version. \n\n\"But we never considered selling Pok\u00e9mon abroad,\"Mr Ishihara says.\n\n\"People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.\"\n\nPok\u00e9mon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.\n\n\"All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,\"Mr Ishihara says.\n\nPok\u00e9mania strikes\n\nMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. \n\n\"As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,\"he says. \n\nAt its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded\"Pok\u00e9mania\"- led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pok\u00e9mon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of\"Pok\u00e9mon card crime\". \n\nThere was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. \n\nI want to be the very best\n\nAlthough this wave of Pok\u00e9mania died down in the years that followed, Pok\u00e9mon never went away. \n\n2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pok\u00e9mon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. \n\n\"As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,\"says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pok\u00e9mon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe channel led to work commentating at official Pok\u00e9mon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. \n\n\"The cool thing about Pok\u00e9mon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pok\u00e9mon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,\"he says. \n\n16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds\n\nOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. \n\nThe channel,\"Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon\", broadcast a stream of Pok\u00e9mon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. \n\n\"I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,\"says Marcus\"djWHEAT\"Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.\n\n\"The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,\"he says. \n\nThe chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.\n\nTwitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. \n\nThe sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream's most beloved Pok\u00e9mon to be\"released\", meaning they were lost forever. \n\nBut after 16 days, seven hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds of play, the stream completed the game. In all, 1.16 million people had played, and more than nine million had watched. \n\nMarcus Graham believes the\"Pok\u00e9mon\"part of Twitch Plays Pok\u00e9mon was the key to success, as the stream combined the simple goals of catching monsters and collecting gym badges with players' nostalgia for the classic game and its cast of familiar characters. \n\n\"I really do think that because the game was Pok\u00e9mon that played a massive part in the explosive virality of it all. It was kind of that perfect storm.\"\n\nGotta catch'em all\n\nWhile the world watched millions play Pok\u00e9mon Red on Twitch, a Japanese software engineer was working on an April Fool's joke. \n\nTatsuo Nomura (who declined to be interviewed for this article) worked for Google's maps division. A Pok\u00e9mon fan since childhood, Nomura decided to blend the two, hiding Pok\u00e9mon on a map of the world for users to find. \n\n\"Mr Nomura used to find exploits in Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green when he was a kid, that's how he became interested in computer programming,\"explains the Pok\u00e9mon Company's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who greenlit the project after receiving a pitch from Google-owned game developer Niantic.\n\n\"That passion led him to join Google, then Google Maps, and consequently he created Pok\u00e9mon GO.\"\n\nThe mobile game was an instant success, introducing millions of players to a world of\"augmented reality\"gaming. To play, users must walk around in the real world in order to find and catch Pok\u00e9mon on their phone screens.\n\nOne Japanese player, playing under the name Kyarorina, got hooked after his workplace organised a walking competition for its staff.   \n\n\"The goal of simply walking turned into an obsession with chasing after rare Pok\u00e9mon and catching them all,\"he says.\n\nThe stats tell the full story: since first downloading Pok\u00e9mon GO in July 2016, he has walked over 31,000km (19,200 miles) and visited more than a million Pok\u00e9stops - real-life locations where players can collect in-game items. \n\nIn 2019, Kyarorina became the first person to catch one million Pok\u00e9mon in-game. \n\n\"Recently I've been spending about eight to 10 hours a day catching Pok\u00e9mon, about 2,000 a day. I think I'll hit two million by the end of this month and announce it on Twitter,\"he tells the BBC.\n\nPok\u00e9mon GO's initial popularity was matched by its profitability. In 2020, five years after the game was first released, it saw record revenues of over $1bn (\u00a3718m). The free-to-play game makes money both by charging players for items and by charging businesses for the privilege of appearing on the in-game map. \n\nFor Neriko Doerr and Debra Occhi, cultural anthropologists who co-authored a book on Pok\u00e9mon GO, the game is evidence of Pok\u00e9mon's broad appeal - something that can help explain the franchise's success. \n\n\"Pokemon GO attracted people who are into going outside, walking around and people who are happy with just collecting Pokemon into the game world, some of whom became very enthusiastic,\"Ms Doerr says.\n\nThe red pins\n\nAs Pok\u00e9mon's 25th birthday approached, the franchise once again hit headlines as YouTuber Logan Paul paid $2m for six boxes of vintage Pok\u00e9mon cards.\n\n\"This is a newfound obsession of mine and I am so excited to share it with other enthusiasts around the world,\"the controversial entertainer wrote on social media.  \n\n\"Pokemon cards have always been highly prized,\"says Tracy Martin, an expert in valuing post-war collectables. \n\n\"This is down to nostalgia and obviously the rarity of a card, but also Pokemon is still very current. It's a phenomenon that seems to grip both children and adults, and that's the main reason why it's still going strong,\"she says. \n\n\"That was not what we expected,\"says Pok\u00e9mon's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who was himself featured on a Pok\u00e9mon card that last year sold for $50,000.\n\nSo what does Ishihara expect the next 25 years will bring for Pok\u00e9mon? \n\n\"World domination\"he says, eyes fixed on the red pins that dot his map. \n\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Sakiko Shiraishi.", "output": "In Tokyo's ritzy Roppongi neighbourhood, Tsunekazu Ishihara, president of The Pok\u00e9mon Company, sits opposite a giant map of the world."}, {"input": "More than 30 tonnes of marijuana was seized - as well as cocaine - in the Complexo do Alemao favela, police say.\n\nSome 2,600 police and paratroopers carried out a pre-dawn assault on the favela, where hundreds of drug traffickers had been holed up.   \n\nGunfire was heard but police were met with less resistance than expected.\n\nDrug traffickers had been given an ultimatum to surrender by sunset on Saturday or face an assault. \n\nOfficers later hoisted the Brazilian and police flags on the hilltop of Alemao.\n\nLuxurious mansion\n\nOfficials said they seized the marijuana, which was packaged for delivery, from several houses in Grota - one of the shantytowns that make up the Alemao complex.\n\nPolice then formed a long human chain, passing the drug along to awaiting lorries in a main street. \n\nForces also moved from house to house, searching the area for hundreds of alleged drug traffickers who police feared could be trying to escape through the sewerage system. \n\nOfficers said that during their search of the area, they had found the luxurious mansion of one an alleged drug dealer, complete with rooftop swimming pool and its own armoury.\n\nThe three-storey house with a sauna and disco was empty when the officers arrived and much of the electronic equipment inside had already been destroyed, police said.\n\nWithin hours of Sunday's operation, police said they had taken control of the favela.\n\n\"We won.
