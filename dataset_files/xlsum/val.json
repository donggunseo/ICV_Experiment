This would be to ensure their goods meet EU standards.\n\nFollowing incidents like foot-and-mouth disease and the horse meat scandal, the EU is very strict about these requirements.  \n\nIn theory, such checks would mean things like cameras and security posts, creating a so-called\"hard border\".\n\nConcerns have been raised that the return of a hard border could jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement. This helped bring the period of violence in Northern Ireland known as\"The Troubles\"to an end.\n\nSo why hasn't it been sorted yet?\n\nUK and EU Brexit negotiators came up with a solution - known as the Irish backstop - to avoid border checks. \n\nIf used, the backstop would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks is agreed.\n\nHowever, the backstop proved unacceptable to many Conservative MPs, who feared the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely.\n\nTheir opposition eventually led to Theresa May's resignation as prime minister.\n\nBoris Johnson, the new prime minister, said a revised Brexit deal must include\"the abolition of the backstop\".\n\nHe says the current solution would mean\"signing away\"the UK's\"economic independence\".\n\nCan technology solve the problem?\n\nA\"wealth of solutions\"including technology could replace the the backstop and avoid the need for a hard border, Boris Johnson said during the Tory leadership campaign.\n\nSupporters say custom checks could be done at warehouses before lorries set off. Mobile phone technology or microchips on lorries, would track goods and avoid the need for border posts. \n\nHowever, the EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated.\n\nThat includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average.\n\nThe EU has said it will consider other solutions to the Irish border problem, but only once the current Brexit deal has been signed off. It has also expressed doubts about a technological solution.\n\nThe problem with just relying on technology, is that EU law also require some products to be physically checked - chemicals and food are among them. \n\nSo what else could be done?\n\nAlongside technology, Mr Johnson has also talked about a trusted trader scheme. Businesses would be allowed to by-pass checks once they've proven to be trustworthy and have met certain standards.\n\nFor it to work, the UK would need to persuade the EU to recognise it. \n\nBut setting up such a scheme would a take a lot of time and cost a lot of money. The UK would also need to come up with an effective way of enforcing it and prevent smuggling.  \n\nCould checks take place away from the border?\n\nAnother solution that has been proposed is to allow agriculture checks to take place in\"mobile units away from the border\".\n\nHowever, existing EU law states that animal checks must take place at designated Border Inspections Posts (BIPs)\"in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry\"- which would include the Irish border. \n\nThe EU says\"geographic constraints\"are the only exception (eg mountains, cliffs, valleys, rivers). In these cases,\"a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated.\"\n\nSo getting the EU to allow checks to take place away from the border, for non-geographic reasons, would require a change in the rules.  \n\nBack to a Northern Ireland-only backstop?\n\nMr Johnson has also suggested the idea of an all-Ireland food standards zone. In other words, Northern Ireland would keep the same food and animal standards as the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.\n\nHowever, it's unclear how food and animal products would be separated from other trade in order to prevent smuggling. If smuggling was to occur, it could threaten the integrity of the single market. \n\nBut some say the UK could go further and agree a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union and parts of the single market - eliminating the need for any cross-border checks.\n\nBut the DUP, which supports the Conservatives in government, has previously rejected the idea of a Northern Ireland backstop on the basis it would create checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \n\nWho will build the border posts?\n\nNo-one has started building border posts and the UK and Irish governments say they do not want a hard border.\n\nSo there is a very real question, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, about who would actually install the border posts if the EU insist they're necessary.  \n\nBoris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nWhat questions do you have about Brexit?

They did not say when travel would begin.\n\nLimited travel and expensive holidays\n\nThe bubble currently applies only to the state of New South Wales and the Northern Territory, but Australian officials said they hoped to expand to other states soon.  \n\nUnder the deal, New Zealanders can travel quarantine-free to Australia if they have not been to a Covid-19 hotspot for 14 days.  \n\nBut a holiday in Australia could be expensive. Upon their return, New Zealand passengers will have to quarantine at a cost of NZ$3,100 ($2,045; \u00a31,586) for the first person and more for additional family members.\n\nAbout 90% of those travelling with Air New Zealand on Friday were booked one-way, the airline said.  \n\nAir New Zealand, Qantas and Jetstar all had flights scheduled to arrive in Sydney on Friday. \n\nUpon arrival, passengers from New Zealand are kept separate from other passengers, who will be required to spend two weeks in quarantine.  \n\nSince March, Australia's borders have been closed to everyone except returning Australian citizens and residents and those with special permission.    \n\nAll arrivals are now required to quarantine at their own expense. \n\nThere is a backlog of around 29,000 Australians trying to get into the country.\n\nNew Zealand has recorded 1,880 cases and 25 deaths from Covid-19, while Australia has seen over 27,000 infections and 904 deaths. \n\nThe majority of Australia's cases have been in the state of Victoria, which enacted tough lockdowns to bring the numbers under control.   \n\nGreen shoots for travel industry\n\nThe limited resumption of international travel between Australia and New Zealand could be an early indication of a slight recovery for the travel industry in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong's in-principle deal would require travellers between the cities to test negative for Covid-19 with a mutually-agreed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. \n\nAccording to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the pandemic led to a 72% drop in international tourists in the first half of the year.  \n\nHowever, there has been a rebound in domestic tourism in some markets, such as China.  \n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 290 airlines, expects traffic to be 66% below the level it was in 2019.\n\nThe IATA estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels.", "output": "The first passengers from New Zealand have arrived in Australia under new \"travel bubble\" arrangements between the two countries."}, {"input": "The latest weekly figures show that just 78% of patients across Scotland were seen within the target time.\n\nThis was well below the Scottish government's 95% target, and the lowest since the weekly figures began in February 2015.\n\nIn the same week in 2016 there were 92.5% treated within four hours.\n\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison told BBC Scotland the latest figures were for the week ending on Hogmanay, which had been a\"very challenging\"time for the health service.\n\nShe said the number of flu cases had been double the same period last year and this had caused\"exceptional pressures\"for A&E. \n\nMs Robison also said the freezing weather around Christmas had caused problems which had continued to have an impact.\n\n\"There were real pressures but despite that nearly eight out of 10 patients are still being seen, treated and discharged within four hours,\"Ms Robison said.\n\n\"That is a huge achievement for staff, given these winter pressures.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said the latest figures were\"nothing short of a disgrace\".\n\nFour-hour-target\n\nIn the week before Christmas the figure for those being admitted, transferred or discharged inside the four-hour target was 83.3%, up from the previous record low of 81.1% in the week before.\n\nThe latest figures, for the week ending 31 December, show there were 25,865 attendances at emergency departments across Scotland.\n\nOf these, 5,686 were not dealt with within the four-hour target.\n\nThe statistics show that 1,156 (4.5%) patients spent more than eight hours in an emergency department.\n\nThere were 272 (1.1%) patients who spent more than 12 hours in A&E.\n\nThe worst performing health board area was NHS Forth Valley which saw just 57.3% within the target time.\n\nGreater Glasgow (71.1%), Lothian (76.2%) and Lanarkshire (76.8%) also missed the target time in about a quarter of cases.  \n\nNHS Grampian (87.9%), NHS Highland (87.6%) and NHS Tayside (87.3%) were the best performing mainland health boards.\n\nAnalysis by data journalist Marc Ellison\n\nWith statistics, the devil is always in the details.\n\nThe latest tranche of weekly waiting time data is no doubt shocking, with just 78% of patients across Scotland being seen within four hours - down five percentage points on the previous week.\n\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you'll find the situation in some areas is even worse.\n\nFor example, Forth Valley's casualty waiting rooms saw just 57.3% of patients within the target, down 22 percentage points.\n\nThat figure eclipses the 8-point drop on the previous week for NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, who both remained among the best performers despite the big fall.\n\nOne can go a step further, and also look at how each individual hospital fared between Christmas and Hogmanay.\n\nForth Valley Royal's performance was down most (22 percentage points), Raigmore Hospital in Inverness was down 14 points, and Ninewells Hospital in Dundee was 10 percentage points lower than the previous week.\n\nBut how does this compare to the corresponding week from December 2016, I hear you ask?\n\nWell, the comparison isn't flattering.\n\nAgain NHS Forth Valley heads the leaderboard with a 36 percentage point decrease (it was 93% in week 52 of 2016) in the number of patients seen within four hours.\n\nNHS Lothian and Lanarkshire fare a little better with differences of 20 percentage points and 17 respectively.\n\nBut one should note that the data for week 52 covers slightly different dates - 25 December 2016 to 1 January 2017, versus 24 to 31 December 2017.\n\nHowever, considering the previous year's figures included New Year's Day - a day that might be expected to see a high number of alcohol-induced injuries in A&E - the decrease in patients seen in December 2017 is arguably even more telling.\n\nCase study - Allan Browne, A&E patient\n\nAllan Browne was among patients affected by long waiting times during the festive period. He told BBC Scotland he went to A&E on Boxing Day with a suspected fractured ankle after slipping on ice.\n\n\"When I went it in, it looked not too busy, but the woman at reception told me it could be as much as an eight-hour wait to be seen. Eight hours is a long time. \n\n\"She said it was probably not broken and told me it was up to me if I wanted to hang about. I decided not to.\"\n\n\"After a week of not being able to sleep properly because the pain was so sore, I decided I am going to have to go back to A&E to see if I can get an X-ray and just see how long it takes.\"\n\nThis time Mr Browne saw a nurse after about three-and-a-half hours.\n\n\"She told me that I had fractured my ankle and that I shouldn't have been walking on it,\"he said.\n\nHe believes the delay in getting proper treatment has lengthened his recovery time. \n\nHe added:\"I always hear the excuse that this is a'seasonal problem'.

That gives Amazon first-mover advantage.\n\nWhile a glance around CES's show floors suggests Alexa is poised to dominate, it's worth remembering that this is a US trade show.\n\nAmazon is not quite as global a company as Google or Microsoft - the online retailer doesn't have a website for countries in Scandinavia, the Middle East or Africa, for example.\n\nAnd not all implementations of Alexa make the assistant easy to access, notes Lauren Goode at news site The Verge.\n\nShe tested headphones by OnVocal that make the aide accessible - via a tiny button that needs to be pressed to activate it.\n\n\"You'd kind of think that walking around while wearing these is just as good as having an Echo strapped to your body.

Across CES, you can hear Amazon's creation at work. \n\nWho'd have thought a few years back that an online retailer with a patchy record when it comes to hardware devices would be the single most influential player at a consumer electronics event?\n\nIn the past, it has been Apple and Google who've been able to dominate CES without even turning up - now Amazon is looking like the tech industry's thought leader. \n\nWhile Alexa may be popular, it certainly has rivals.\n\nNvidia announced at CES that its media streaming device, Shield, would feature Google Assistant - allowing users to display photos on their TV screens via voice command, for example.\n\nIt can also connect with the Nest smart thermostat and adjust the temperature - or turn on smart home devices.\n\nMicrosoft's Cortana will, of course, be available in Windows 10 devices - a wide array of which were launched this week.\n\nBut curiously, despite publishing a teaser video for a Harman Kardon speaker featuring Cortana last month, the product failed to materialise.\n\nHarman Kardon told the BBC that the device was\"not ready for display\".\n\nThe battle of the AIs doesn't even end there. In October, Samsung acquired fledgling AI Viv and is expected to launch it with the firm's Galaxy S8 smartphone later in 2017.\n\nIt is worth noting that the South Korean tech giant has also agreed to buy Harman Kardon.\n\nWill Viv nudge out Cortana in future Harman Kardon speakers and one day give Alexa a run for its money?

There are no windows because the pods travel down a steel tube in a near vacuum. \n\nSeveral companies are vying to take the concept to the mass market.  Not content with creating reusable rockets, SpaceX has constructed a hyperloop test track in California. \n\nThe Edinburgh students are heading there to race their capsule against prototypes from around the world. \n\nGoing on your holidays in a windowless pod travelling at hundreds of miles an hour inside a vacuum tube may not be your idea of fun, but Adam Anyszewski says hardly anyone looks out of the windows when travelling by plane.  \n\nAdam is president of Edinburgh's hyperloop team, known as HYPED.  \n\nHe says:\"It's a new mode of transport that's more energy efficient, less costly per mile to build and later on maintain and upgrade.\" \n\n\"The speeds could get you from the Central Belt to anywhere around London in 40 minutes.\n\n\"It promises to kick our transportation system into the 21st century.\" \n\nThe prototype capsule they have created has taken shape in a university workshop.  It most resembles a bobsleigh, albeit one with no way of looking out or steering. \n\nIt's long, low and glossy black, festooned with sponsors' logos. \n\nThose sponsors and the university have helped meet the considerable cost of creating a highly sophisticated machine.  \n\nThe students have given thousands of hours of their spare time to design, develop and build it.  \n\nMaisie Edwards-Mowforth is a second year mechanical engineering student and HYPED's chassis project manager. \n\nShe explains the reason for the glossy black finish: carbon fibre.  \n\n\"We're using it for the strength-to-weight ratio so we can go a lot faster if the pod is a lot lighter.  \n\n\"It's kind of a pain to make.  It takes a lot longer than just buying aluminium channel but weight saving is the main reason - and the strength of carbon fibre as well.\" \n\nThe project is now in its third year and involves well over 100 students.  \n\nIt has produced a prototype pod before but the latest one represents a leap forward.  \n\nEliminate air resistance\n\nThink of it like a train that hovers just above the rails to avoid the drag of friction.  A linear motor drives it forward.  The SpaceX tube track, enclosing an almost total vacuum, will eliminate air resistance.  \n\nSophisticated electronics and programming have been designed to ensure a stable ride.  \n\n\"The ultimate criterion is speed,\"Adam says.  \n\n\"But we have diverted slightly from just achieving the top speed.  \n\n\"We are trying to build something that could actually prove the technology rather than just make a carbon fibre bullet on wheels like some teams do, just to win the competition.\" \n\nThe idea of a\"vactrain\"dates back more than a century.  It was first proposed by the American physicist and engineer Robert Goddard, better known for his pioneering work in rocketry.  \n\nThe concept was given new life by Elon Musk.  His SpaceX and Tesla corporations produced a white paper laying out how it could work.  \n\nThe global competition represents a bold new attempt at innovation, effectively crowdsourcing it.  \n\nSuccess is not guaranteed.  Some seemingly groundbreaking transport concepts such as monorail have only seen niche success at best. Others, like Scotland's Bennie Railplane, never got past the prototype stage.  \n\nWhatever ultimately happens with hyperloop, it is already benefiting the team members - and not just science and engineering students.  \n\nHYPED is an interdisciplinary project that also involves students from disciplines like law, marketing, art and business. Members come from many nations and from every school at the university except divinity. \n\nA spinout company has now been set up to take the technology towards the market.

Because of different patterns in how men and women vote it is likely the result would have been different and Prime Minister Theresa May would have had a majority.\n\nThe results of some other elections would probably have been different too in this alternate reality.\n\nIt's important to be clear about the limitations of what we can know here.\n\nThe secret ballot means we never have definitive figures about how men and women vote. We are reliant on studies that involve asking a sample of the population how they voted after elections have taken place.\n\nThe gender gap in voting is fairly small. Other demographic factors have a far bigger impact on people's likelihood to vote for each party.\n\nIn the past, social class was a dominant factor. Middle-class people were more likely to vote Conservative and working-class people were more likely to vote Labour.\n\nRecently that's changed. In 2017, age and education were far more important. Young voters and voters with degrees were more likely to back Labour. Older voters and those with fewer qualifications were more likely to back the Conservatives.\n\nBut how do the sexes differ when it comes to elections?\n\nIf we look back over time the gender gap in voting has changed.\n\nThe British Election Study has data going back to the 1964 general election. In the 1960s and 1970s it found that women were more likely than men to vote Conservative and less likely to vote Labour. It's not easy to find a definitive explanation.\n\nVoting behaviour expert Dr Rosalind Shorrocks, from the University of Manchester, says that one of the reasons behind the difference was that women were more religious than men, and also points to the way they were affected by government policies. \n\n\"The Conservative Party's post-war anti-rationing stance appealed particularly to housewives who were managing family budgets,\"she explains.\n\nSo in a close election like 1970, it was probably women voters who sealed the Conservative victory.\n\nThat trend evaporated in the 1980s - interestingly when the prime minister was a woman - before returning in the 1990s.\n\nAt recent elections the pattern seems to have become more volatile, like other trends in voting behaviour.\n\nIn 2010 there was very little difference between men and women in terms of the two main parties. But women were more likely to back the Liberal Democrats and less likely to back smaller parties.\n\nThe gender gap for other parties became more pronounced in 2015. This was connected to UKIP's very strong showing. They received 13% of the vote overall but were considerably more popular among men than women.\n\nThat meant that women were more likely than men to vote for both Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nSo if women had been unable to vote, it's quite likely that UKIP would have won more than the single seat they did. Nigel Farage might have become an MP.\n\nIn 2017 the pattern changed again. The British Election Study and other post-election surveys suggest that the gender gap was the opposite of what it used to be.\n\nWomen were more likely than men to vote Labour and less likely to vote Conservative.\n\nThat is likely to have swayed the overall result. The Conservatives were only eight seats short of an outright majority and there was an unusually large number of seats where they lost very narrowly.\n\nSo if women had not voted, Theresa May would probably have had more Conservative MPs and British politics could look very different.\n\nAgain, Dr Shorrocks says this could be down to the perceived impact of government policies.\n\n\"In 2015 and 2017, it is especially younger women - under the age of 40 - who were particularly supportive of Labour. \n\n\"This is likely to be due to the disproportionate impact of austerity on women, with younger women the most likely to say that their cost of living has gone up and quality of services such as the NHS has gone down under the Conservative government.\"\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "output": "It's 100 years since some women (and all men) were finally given the vote.

And so I can't see that's changed in any way so it seems unlikely there is under-representation.\"\n\nDr Wren said in the past, more boys tended to come forward than girls, because girls found it easier to be\"boyish\"in what they wore or how they styled their hair, but that society was now more accepting. \n\nShe added:\"We live in a world where people alter their bodies, surgically or otherwise, and this freedom is available for people as they get older. \n\n\"Maybe we just have to be acknowledging that that is a liberty that people have, that these things are possible, technologically, and people will avail themselves of those things. \n\n\"It's not really for us to approve or disapprove.

That was probably the key thing that drove me forward in terms of pursuing treatment. I felt it the right thing to do on a very instinctual level.\"\n\nSasha, not their real name, started hormone blocking treatment at the age of 18, and went onto testosterone a year later.

To cushion Welsh students from rises in fees at colleges across the country, the Welsh Government agreed to give every student a grant of \u00a35,100 to help them - wherever they chose to study.\n\nBut to the universities here, it has meant a brain drain and money crossing the border - nearly \u00a390m is estimated for this new academic year to be leaving Wales with the student.\n\nUniversity of West of England in Bristol received the most outside Wales - worth \u00a36.7m in tuition fee grants in 2014-15.\n\nThe education secretary has said recently she still wants student support to be\"portable for Welsh students anywhere in the UK\".\n\nThe government argues that universities' income overall has increased - boosted by a significant number of English students and their fees at Welsh universities.\n\nThere is still a net inflow of students coming into Wales - it meant at the start of September, 2,410 more students had chosen to study in Wales from England than those from Wales who travelled in the other direction.  \n\nThis boosts the coffers of Welsh universities. In total for 2014-15 the Welsh higher education sector had an income of \u00a31.43bn.\n\nMore than half of this came from tuition fees and education contracts.\n\nResearch income brought another 15%.\n\nThe Welsh Government has given the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) nearly \u00a3132.5m to fund universities for this year.\n\nFrom this, \u00a321.1m might need to be re-allocated if the tuition fee grant demands are bigger than expected.\n\nWhich leaves about \u00a3112m from HEFCW to fund universities for the core of their work. \n\nSo where is the money going? We know of the \u00a31.38bn spent in 2014-15, about 58% went on academic and other staff costs.\n\nWelsh universities have said the tuition fee grants - set to cost \u00a3258m in 2016/17 - could be better spent helping poor students.\n\nProf Gareth Rees, of the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data & Methods (Wiserd) said the cost of higher education would increase over time - with fees in England likely to follow suit.\n\n\"If it's the case that the amount of money coming in from English students coming to Welsh universities remains sufficiently large that the subsidy - what would be an increasing subsidy to a Welsh student - offsets it then it may well be that the policy would be sustainable,\"he said.\n\n\"My personal view is that the policy of the Welsh Government is not sustainable in the longer term and those inflationary pressures would be one aspect, but obviously there are other aspects too that I think make it a very difficult policy to sustain.\"\n\nWidening access\n\nEducation Secretary Kirsty Williams also wants to make sure students from poorer backgrounds are not put off going to university. \n\n\"We want to make sure that those who wish to go on to university are able to,\"she said on Tuesday.\n\nFor students from families with household incomes of less than \u00a320,000 a year, it should mean under the proposals they would qualify for the maximum grant of more than \u00a39,000 - an equivalent of earning the National Living Wage.\n\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\n\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas. \n\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.  \n\nThe organisation representing universities has called for a means-tested grant up to post-graduate level as the way forward, with tuition fee grants targeted to help those that need them most.\n\nProf Colin Riordan, chairman of Universities Wales, said it was\"fair to students and their families,\"giving the help with living costs now.\n\nHe said it would also provide support for part-time and post-graduate students.\n\nAt times, the Welsh Government has been impatient with academics' complaints about funding.\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Williams suggested that universities should not focus as much on financial issues and should be more active in their communities and in driving forward national economic and social priorities.\n\nSome of her predecessors were more blunt in expressing their view of the return Wales gets for millions invested in its higher education institutions.\n\nBut since the Diamond review started its work in 2014, politicians and university bosses, some of whom have been on the Diamond panel, have looked to the report for answers.\n\nProf Riordan said it would take time for the recommendations to be brought in but despite financial challenges, universities would find ways to manage in the mean time.\n\n\"If the recommendations are implemented, then I feel it will be sustainable future for universities,\"he added.", "output": "Soon after the Welsh Government started paying out grants towards Welsh students' university fees, vice chancellors raised concerns."}, {"input": "Maj Gen Peter Gersten, who is based in Baghdad, said the US had repeatedly targeted stores of the group's funds.\n\nThe blow to the group's financing has contributed to a 90% jump in defections and a drop in new arrivals, he said. \n\nIn 2014, the US Treasury called IS\"the best-funded terrorist organisation\"it had encountered.\n\nIn a briefing to reporters, Maj Gen Gersten, the deputy commander for operations and intelligence for the US-led operation against IS, said under 20 air strikes targeting the group's stores of money had been conducted.\n\nHe did not specify how the US knew how much money had been destroyed.\n\nIn one case, he said, an estimated $150m was destroyed at a house in Mosul, Iraq.\n\nForces fighting IS received intelligence indicating in which room of the house money was stored.

the latest data indicates that the unemployment has reached 26% of the workforce, the highest rate since the country returned to democracy in 1975, with a total of just under six million people unable to find work.\n\nSpain's economic and financial woes raised widespread fears in the financial community last year that the country may ultimately be unable to repay its debts, and may even have to leave the eurozone.\n\nHowever, the threat from financial markets to pull the plug on Spain's government and banks, by refusing to relend them the money they need, has lifted since the summer due to intervention by the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nFrom the end of 2011, the ECB offered banks in the eurozone's troubled southern economies unprecedented and cheap four-year loans, stemming a crisis of confidence in Europe's banking sector.\n\nThe first optional pre-payment date for the loans falls on Wednesday, and several of Spain's biggest banks, including BBVA, Banco Popular and Sabadell, have said they will repay a significant chunk of the loans, signalling that they have garnered enough confidence from other lenders to begin taking themselves off the ECB's emergency drip.\n\nBut although eurozone banks are finding it easier to borrow, they are still cutting back on how much they are willing to lend to the rest of the economy, according to the ECB.\n\nThe central bank's most recent quarterly Bank Lending Survey, released on Wednesday, found that banks in southern Europe, reduced their lending in the last three months of 2012, and expect to do so again during the current quarter.\n\nBanks are responding to demands from regulators to increase their ability to absorb losses on existing loans, and to the general weakness of the eurozone economy, according to Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.\n\n\"This illustrates the double credit whammy in the euro zone,\"he said.\"Tightening of credit conditions on supply side and a fall in demand, it's a squeeze on both sides.\n\n\"[The] crisis of the real economy is far from being over and these numbers support the ECB's view that growth will only return in the second half of the year.\"\n\nEase off?\n\nIn July last year, ECB President Mario Draghi announced the central bank would do\"whatever it takes\"to prevent countries dropping out of the eurozone, and later offered to buy unlimited amounts of the debts of governments such as Spain and Italy, subject to strict conditions that they get their deficits under control.\n\nAlthough neither government has so far taken up the ECB's offer, the mere knowledge that neither Italy nor Spain faces the immediate prospect of running out of money to pay their bills has restored market confidence in both of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, following the release of Spain's disappointing growth data, the government's 10-year implied cost of borrowing nonetheless held steady in markets at about 5.15% - well down from the 7.62% that it peaked at last July.\n\nHowever, the ECB's interventions have not removed the economic challenge to Spain of regaining wage-competitiveness versus Germany within the eurozone, and for the government to get its overspending under control.\n\nAddressing both of these challenges is widely expected by economists to involve many more months or years of grindingly slow growth or even recession.\n\nSpain's Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos, said in Davos on Friday that he expected the economy to return to positive growth only in the second half of this year.\n\nThe success of the ECB in taming the markets has also raised concerns that Madrid may now ease off on the spending cuts and labour market reforms that are still thought to be necessary to restore long-term economic health.\n\nSpain has some support for going slow on austerity from the International Monetary Fund, whose chief economist Olivier Blanchard recently warned that the economic pain caused by government spending cuts across the over-indebted industrialised world since 2009 has proved far worse than expected.\n\nReturn of optimism\n\nMeanwhile, survey data released by the European Commission on Wednesday indicated that the ECB's actions were beginning to filter through to the broader economy.\n\nConfidence among both businessmen and consumers rose for the third month in a row in January, according to the Commission's latest regular survey, with the upturn in business sentiment stronger than had been expected by many economists.\n\nIts economic sentiment index for the eurozone rose to 89.2 from 87.8 in December, still well below the 100 level that marks the boundary between overall optimism and pessimism.\n\nThe rebound in confidence was most marked in Germany, while Spain, France and Italy all lagged.\n\nThis was also reflected in the ECB's Bank Lending Survey, which showed that of all the major eurozone economies, only Germany's saw a notable increase in lending, driven largely by new mortgages.\n\nHowever, businessmen across the eurozone operating in the retail sector did not show greater confidence, according to the survey, chiming with separate survey data from research firm Markit that indicated retail sales across the single currency area fell for the fifteenth month in a row in January.\n\n\"[It] reminds us that consumers remain under pressure from high unemployment, squeezed incomes and uncertainty about the financial outlook, and that any substantial upturn in domestic demand, especially from households, is unlikely to occur any time soon and is therefore unlikely to help drive economic recovery,\"said Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.", "output": "The downturn in the Spanish economy worsened in the final three months of 2012, as output fell 1.8% from a year earlier, official data has indicated."}, {"input": "Oil giant Chevron has asked 300 staff not to come into its office in Canary Wharf\"for the time being\".\n\nCrossrail, which shares the same building as Chevron, and media firm OMD, based in central London, have also asked staff to stay away. \n\nThe real estate company that manages Canary Wharf suggested the firms had reacted with\"an abundance of caution\".\n\nIt\"strongly encouraged\"its tenants to adhere to advice from Public Health England, which says there is no need to send staff home, as most possible cases turn out to be negative. \n\nPHE says even if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus they do not recommend closing the workplace.\n\nIn the UK, there have been 7,132 coronavirus tests carried out since the outbreak began to spread beyond China in January.\n\nOf these, 13 were confirmed positive -

It did get to the point where they were signing contracts. \n\n\"They had a number of companies to oversee this, and Allen came back and said he got the agreements of Hitler and they celebrated with Mosley with champagne.\"\n\nEventually Mosley and Allen fell out over money and political ideals, leading the two men to go their separate ways. \n\nThe former unionist MP was in military service during World War Two, as a member of the Household Cavalry. \n\nWell-travelled with a good knowledge of languages, his skills were much in demand by military chiefs. \n\nHowever, during the war he was questioned by senior officers about his past associations. \n\n'An MI6 link'\n\nDocuments, obtained by the BBC from the National Archives in Kew, show that the former MP was interrogated about his relationship with Mosley. \n\nAllen told his inquisitors that he was a loyal British subject, stressing:\"I should state I have no interest other than to see an out-and-out victory which will restore and maintain the power and reputation of Britain.\"\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a press attach\u00e9 in the British Embassy in Ankara, Turkey. \n\nHe became friends with Kim Philby who was working for military intelligence and later, sensationally, defected to the Russians.\n\nWriter Stephen Dorril believes Bill Allen had a role with military intelligence.\n\n\"All these kind of things suggest the MI6 link.\"\n\nSo did Bill Allen have a secret life? \n\nHis granddaughter Sally Lescher accepts there is some mystery about her grandfather. \n\n\"It's confidential, I would say.

And women now make up the majority of undergraduates, Benatar says.\n\n\"When women are underrepresented as CEOs of companies that is deemed discrimination. But when boys are falling behind at school, when 90% of people in prison are male, there's never any thought given to whether men are discriminated against.\"\n\nIf sexual equality is to be achieved then male discrimination must be taken as seriously as sexism against women, he argues.\n\nEqual pay is the barometer in developed countries like the UK. According to the Office for National Statistics, the gender pay gap is still pronounced within professions. Women earn on average \u00a38,000 less than a man as lawyers, \u00a314,000 less as a CEO and \u00a39,000 less as a doctor.\n\nBut the picture may be changing.

And a survey for the Chartered Management Institute found that female managers in their 20s were earning 2.1% more than their male counterparts. \n        \n\nSuch controversies are feeding a sense that men need to set up their own support structures.

We don't believe in cultural definitions of men.\"\n\nThere's a cultural context, too. Some of the men's rights-type concerns echo those of feminists - male body image is a growing issue. \n\nAnd there are some who feel that while feminism has addressed discrimination against women, outdated attitudes towards men have not been tackled. \n\nTom Martin gained attention last year after suing the London School of Economics' gender studies department for sexism. \n\nHe says he was radicalised while working as a barman in a club in Soho.\"I could see that male customers were being abused at every point,\"he says. \n\nMen had to queue and often pay while women got in free. They were goaded by bouncers to leave, while women were treated with respect. But worst of all, he believes they were used by women to buy drinks. \n\nBut Martin says it is all about sex.\n\n\"Since the pill, women have been told they can and should be having orgasms. And because they haven't been, they categorise that as men's fault.\"\n\nHe concludes that\"it's women's job to make themselves sexually happy, it's not a man's burden.\"\n\nThe psychologist Oliver James believes men are feeling\"sexually threatened\". \n\nWomen are no longer reticent about sex or their expectations from a lover. Furthermore they are now more likely to evaluate a man's sexual performance in public and even deride men who\"aren't particularly imaginative or clever\"in bed, he argues. \n\nFor feminists the men's movement is more straightforward.\"It's the same old point that feminism has gone too far,\"says Mail on Sunday columnist Suzanne Moore.\n\nThe continuing gender pay gap and the fact that men dominate senior positions in public life, show up where the real discrimination is, she argues. There are problems with the way boys are educated but\"you can't make sweeping statements about all men being discriminated against\", she says.\n\nKat Banyard, author of The Equality Illusion, says men make the mistake of fearing feminism when it offers them liberation from an outdated masculinity.\"There's a belief that feminism is a zero sum game and that men are losing.\"\n\nTo argue that men are now the victims of the gender struggle is absurd, she says.\"For thousands of years women were subjugated as second class citizens. We've just started to change that in the last two centuries and there's a long way to go. The men's activists are denying history.\"\n\nMale rights campaigners have struggled to shed their\"cranky\"image, argues Tim Samuels, presenter of BBC Radio 5 live's Men's Hour. \n\nMost men don't see themselves as part of a movement, Samuels says. But they do want to talk to each other with a greater emotional complexity than previous generations of men -\"even if it's not like Oprah\".\n\nAnd whatever one thinks about the spectrum of men's rights activism, there are important issues, like the fact that young men are three times as likely to die by suicide as young women. \n\n\"The men's movement tends to be dismissed as blokes scaling buildings dressed as superman. Whereas the women's movement is given credibility,\"Samuels says.", "output": "An increasingly vocal men's movement argues that anti-male discrimination is rife. Who are the activists and what do they want?"}]
