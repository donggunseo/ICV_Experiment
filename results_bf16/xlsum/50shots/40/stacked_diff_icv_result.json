Across Australia, a spotlight is being shone on the failure of government agencies to protect women and children from violent partners and fathers.\n\nThe murder of Melbourne woman Kelly Thompson by her ex-partner in February this year was not unusual. On average, one woman is killed every week across Australia by a current or former partner, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology.\n\nMs Thompson was stabbed to death in her home by Wayne Wood, who then killed himself. \n\nIn the months preceding her death, she had spoken to police about Wood's violent behaviour many times and he had regularly breached a police intervention order that was supposed to prevent him going within 200m of her house.\n\nHer story highlighted how courts and police often fail women and children when they are in most need of protection.\n\nSix months after she was killed, Ms Thompson's parents joined Victoria's leading family violence organisations on the steps of the Victorian parliament to speak out at the launch of the No More Deaths campaign.\n\n Wendy Thompson said the police\"miserably failed\"her daughter.\"And they've failed two people that are now dead and families that are shattered. And it should never have happened,\"she told ABC TV.\n\nPolitical action\n\nThe No More Deaths campaign has called on Victoria's political parties to commit to wide-ranging policies to keep women and children safe ahead of the 29 November election.\n\nAll three of Victoria's parties - the Coalition, Labor and The Greens - attended the launch. The Greens have adopted much of the campaign's platform, the Labor Party has promised a royal commission into family violence, and the Coalition government has announced a A$150m ($131m; \u00a381m) action package.\n\nThe commitments have not come too soon, says Domestic Violence Victoria chief executive officer Fiona McCormack.\n\n\"The rates at which Australian women are being assaulted and terrorised are obscene but particularly the number of women and children being murdered in Victoria,\"she says.\n\n\"Every family that we speak to says the same thing: they want the death of their family member to be the catalyst for a turning point in how we respond to this issue.\"\n\nA combination of factors made this the right time to launch the campaign in Victoria, says senior policy officer at the Federation of Community Legal Centres, Chris Atmore.\n\n\"This year, there has been a lot of media attention on several family violence killings that really touched the public and as a consequence, touched politicians, particularly because two of these killings happened in public,\"says Dr Atmore.\n\nIn April, 33-year-old Fiona Warzywoda was stabbed to death by her partner, Craig McDermott, in a busy suburban shopping centre in Melbourne. \n\nOnly hours before, she had attended court in relation to an order preventing McDermott from approaching her.\n\n\"That case really touched the community directly, the people in the shopping centre, the shopkeepers \u2026 and there was a public vigil organised by her family,\"says Mr Atmore.\n\nThe emergence of Luke Batty's mother as an articulate advocate for the rights of women and children at risk has also changed public attitudes, she says.\n\nIn February, 11-year-old Luke was beaten with a cricket bat and then stabbed by his father in front of horrified onlookers at a cricket training session in rural Victoria.\n\n\"Rosie Batty has emerged as an extraordinary advocate for change\u2026 politicians have been falling over themselves to meet her,\"says Dr Atmore.\n\n\"It's almost like a perfect storm\u2026 We have had a sense that our politicians are taking the issue more seriously in recent months because we have been invited to sit at the table.\"\n\nState by state\n\nLegislators and police have been under pressure in other states and public attitudes about the issue are being questioned.\n\nIn Queensland, former governor-general Dame Quentin Bryce last month said the gravity and severity of domestic violence in that state was far worse than people realised.  Dame Quentin is chairing a task force reviewing the service and facilities available to victims of family violence.\n\nIn Western Australia, the family of murdered indigenous woman Andrea Pickett, a mother of 13 children, are suing the state government and police service in what lawyers are calling a landmark case. They are suing over the authorities' failure to act despite Ms Pickett's numerous reports to police about her estranged husband's violence.\n\nIn New South Wales, the Labor Party says it will establish a specialist court for domestic violence and sexual assault cases if it wins next year's state election.\n\nMoo Baulch, acting chief executive officer of community organisation Domestic Violence NSW, welcomed Labor's announcement. However, she said many people still view domestic violence as something that happens behind closed doors.\n\nShe is disturbed that some media have portrayed Geoff Hunt, who in September killed his wife and children on their rural property in NSW and then killed himself, as a victim. \n\nThere have been suggestions Mr Hunt had snapped because of the burden of looking after his disabled wife.\n\n\"In this day and age, it is amazing that we will make this kind of excuse for a murder. As a nation we have got a long way to go,\"says Ms Baulch.\nTL;DR:",

And it should never have happened,\"she told ABC TV.\n\nPolitical action\n\nThe No More Deaths campaign has called on Victoria's political parties to commit to wide-ranging policies to keep women and children safe ahead of the 29 November election.\n\nAll three of Victoria's parties - the Coalition, Labor and The Greens - attended the launch. The Greens have adopted much of the campaign's platform, the Labor Party has promised a royal commission into family violence, and the Coalition government has announced a A$150m ($131m; \u00a381m) action package.\n\nThe commitments have not come too soon, says Domestic Violence Victoria chief executive officer Fiona McCormack.\n\n\"The rates at which Australian women are being assaulted and terrorised are obscene but particularly the number of women and children being murdered in Victoria,\"she says.\n\n\"Every family that we speak to says the same thing: they want the death of their family member to be the catalyst for a turning point in how we respond to this issue.\"\n\nA combination of factors made this the right time to launch the campaign in Victoria, says senior policy officer at the Federation of Community Legal Centres, Chris Atmore.\n\n\"This year, there has been a lot of media attention on several family violence killings that really touched the public and as a consequence, touched politicians, particularly because two of these killings happened in public,\"says Dr Atmore.\n\nIn April, 33-year-old Fiona Warzywoda was stabbed to death by her partner, Craig McDermott, in a busy suburban shopping centre in Melbourne. \n\nOnly hours before, she had attended court in relation to an order preventing McDermott from approaching her.\n\n\"That case really touched the community directly, the people in the shopping centre, the shopkeepers \u2026 and there was a public vigil organised by her family,\"says Mr Atmore.\n\nThe emergence of Luke Batty's mother as an articulate advocate for the rights of women and children at risk has also changed public attitudes, she says.\n\nIn February, 11-year-old Luke was beaten with a cricket bat and then stabbed by his father in front of horrified onlookers at a cricket training session in rural Victoria.\n\n\"Rosie Batty has emerged as an extraordinary advocate for change\u2026 politicians have been falling over themselves to meet her,\"says Dr Atmore.\n\n\"It's almost like a perfect storm\u2026 We have had a sense that our politicians are taking the issue more seriously in recent months because we have been invited to sit at the table.\"\n\nState by state\n\nLegislators and police have been under pressure in other states and public attitudes about the issue are being questioned.\n\nIn Queensland, former governor-general Dame Quentin Bryce last month said the gravity and severity of domestic violence in that state was far worse than people realised.  Dame Quentin is chairing a task force reviewing the service and facilities available to victims of family violence.\n\nIn Western Australia, the family of murdered indigenous woman Andrea Pickett, a mother of 13 children, are suing the state government and police service in what lawyers are calling a landmark case. They are suing over the authorities' failure to act despite Ms Pickett's numerous reports to police about her estranged husband's violence.\n\nIn New South Wales, the Labor Party says it will establish a specialist court for domestic violence and sexual assault cases if it wins next year's state election.\n\nMoo Baulch, acting chief executive officer of community organisation Domestic Violence NSW, welcomed Labor's announcement. However, she said many people still view domestic violence as something that happens behind closed doors.\n\nShe is disturbed that some media have portrayed Geoff Hunt, who in September killed his wife and children on their rural property in NSW and then killed himself, as a victim. \n\nThere have been suggestions Mr Hunt had snapped because of the burden of looking after his disabled wife.\n\n\"In this day and age, it is amazing that we will make this kind of excuse for a murder. As a nation we have got a long way to go,\"says Ms Baulch.",

She is met with a long silence from Mr Aylward, who then says he cannot hear her and asks to move on to another question.\n\nMs Tong presses him again, saying she would like to talk about Taiwan. At this point, Mr Aylward appears to hang up on her.\n\nWhen the journalist calls Mr Aylward again, she asks if he could comment on Taiwan's response to the coronavirus. \n\nMr Aylward then replies:\"Well, we've already talked about China.\"\n\nHis last line appeared to mirror China's stance on Taiwan, which is that the island is a breakaway province. Taiwan, however, considers itself an independent country.\n\nWhat is Taiwan's relationship with the WHO?\n\nAylward's reaction was widely seen as indicative of the awkward relationship the WHO has with Taiwan, which is not allowed to be a member state.\n\nWHO membership is only given to countries that are members of the United Nations - which does not recognise Taiwan - or whose applications are approved by the World Health Assembly. \n\nWhat this means is that Taiwan has been excluded from emergency meetings and important global expert briefings on the coronavirus pandemic. Taiwanese official Stanley Kao has also said the island has been denied permission to attend the World Health Assembly's annual meetings in recent years. \n\nIt also means the WHO lists Taiwan's coronavirus statistics together with China's, a move Mr Kao says denies the world of accurate and timely information on the pandemic.\n\nThe exclusion, coupled with the WHO's repeated praise of China's response to the outbreak - which public health experts have criticised - has led some to accuse the organisation of political bias towards China, a major contributor to the organisation.\n\nThe WHO is far from the only global body that excludes or does not officially recognise Taiwan - other major examples include the International Olympics Committee and the International Civil Aviation Organization.\n\nBut the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei says that of all these groups, the WHO is perhaps the most important to Taiwan, which prides itself on having one of the best healthcare systems in the world.\n\nThe island previously enjoyed good relations with Beijing, and in the past was an observer at the World Health Assembly, but it lost this status in recent years as tensions have increased between Taipei and Beijing.\n\nWhy is Taiwan's exclusion a problem?\n\nTaiwan consistently raises objections every time it is excluded from a global body, saying it is unfair and discriminatory. \n\nThis time it has made the same point, adding that it should not be left out at a time where global cooperation is needed more than ever. Earlier this month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring it when the government asked about person-to-person transmission at the very start of the outbreak in China, which it said put lives at risk.\n\n\"We hope through the test of this epidemic, the WHO can recognise clearly that epidemics do not have national borders, no one place should be left out because any place that is left out could become a loophole\u2026 any place's strength shouldn't be neglected so that it can make contributions to the world,\"said Taiwan's health minister Chen Shih-chung at a recent press conference.\n\nTaiwan has also pointed out that it learned many lessons from managing its coronavirus outbreak which could be shared with the world. The island has been praised for its swift and decisive handling of its epidemic, which has been relatively controlled and has seen few deaths. \n\nThe measures included drastically cutting inbound flights from China and imposing quarantines on travellers early on, which experts say was key in stopping the spread in the community, as well as strict surveillance measures on those in quarantine.  \n\n\"They have also done focused testing on people suspected to have coronavirus, and also very good contact tracing and social distancing.

But in Sangin - the most violent district in Afghanistan - these are crimes that some of the police commit.\n\nPoliticians insist the handover to the Afghan security forces is going smoothly and that they will be able to maintain security as the allied forces withdraw. \n\nOn a recent visit to Helmand, UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the\"transition is proceeding very well - it is on track.\n\n\"The Afghans are developing capabilities faster than we expected and we have every reason to believe that they will be able to maintain security as the Isaf forces draw down,\"he added.\n\nThe outgoing commander of Nato forces, Gen John Allen, is even more ebullient:\"Afghan forces are defending Afghan people and enabling the government of this country to serve its citizens. This is victory.

All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead.\n\nIn the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan\"Je suis Charlie\"(I am Charlie).\n\nThe magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French\"freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience\".\n\nWhat is happening at the trial?\n\nEleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could\"already feel the tension\".\n\n\"I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,\"she said, adding that she wanted to know\"what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed\".\n\nThe trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together\"all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions\".\n\nThe alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket.\n\nThree of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia.

More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared.   \n\nThe full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State.\n\nAnother aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs.\n\nWhat happened in 2015?\n\nOn 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers Ch\u00e9rif and Sa\u00efd Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. \n\nThe magazine's editor at the time, St\u00e9phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb, was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. \n\nThe gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor.\n\nIn a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris.\n\nHe had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city.\n\nSecurity forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages.\n\nWho are the accused?\n\nThey include 35-year-old Ali Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. \n\nMicka\u00ebl Pastor Alwatik's DNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene. Mohamed Fares has told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, while Amir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf, Willy Prevost and Christophe Raumel are accused of having provided support.\n\nTwo people in Belgium - garage owner Metin Karasular and his associate Michel Catino, an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage owner Miguel Martinez and his associate Abdelaziz Abbad - are accused of supplying\"assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests\"to the three gunmen.\n\nOn trial in absentia is Hayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive.\n\nA female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp.\n\nMohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine are accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria.

She has been in custody since July. \n\nShe has also agreed to co-operate with investigators. Prosecutors expect the deal will give them information about Russia's efforts to interfere in US politics.\n\nHer lawyer, Robert Driscoll, estimates that she could face up to six months in prison, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nShe is being held at an adult detention centre in Virginia, and a sentencing hearing has been set for 12 February.\n\nThe case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election in an attempt to secure victory for Donald Trump.\n\nWho is Maria Butina?\n\nBorn in the southern Siberian city of Barnaul in 1988, according to her Facebook page, she has enjoyed using weapons ever since she was a child, picking up a gun for the first time at the age of 10.\n\nIn 2011, she set up the Right to Bear Arms group and called for the sale of short-barrelled firearms to civilians to be made legal.\n\nButina began travelling to the US for NRA conventions. In 2015 she attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas, asking the presidential candidate about his views on US sanctions against Russia.\n\nBy 2016 she had a student visa to study for a master's degree at American University in Washington DC.\n\nA piece of a larger puzzle\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher in Washington\n\nIn some ways, Maria Butina was like any other young, ambitious, aspiring political player in Washington DC trying to network their way to power and status. The difference, of course, is that she was a Russian national in communication with, and taking actions to advance the interest of, influential Russian officials. \n\nTo do so without registering with the US government is a federal crime - and now she faces a prison sentence and deportation.\n\nThe details outlined in the plea agreement are not exactly the stuff of spy novels. She arranged a Russian delegation to a prestigious Washington prayer event, hobnobbed at the National Rifle Association convention and organised a visit by US gun rights advocates to Moscow. Taken in isolation, these\"informal channels of communication\"with American conservatives could have helped improve US-Russia relations but were hardly nefarious.\n\nViewed in the context of other Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election presented by Robert Mueller's investigation - including hacking Democratic Party communications, waging an illicit social media campaign, and funding and organising on-the ground political rallies and protests - and the Butina plea seems more like a small but potentially meaningful piece of a much larger puzzle.\n\nWhat are the accusations against her?\n\nFederal prosecutors said Butina was directed by a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political groups, including an unnamed pro-gun lobbying organisation presumed to be the NRA, which is close to Mr Trump's Republican party.\n\nIn a statement read in court, one of the federal prosecutors said Butina had drafted, in March 2015, a document called\"Diplomacy Project\"that called for unofficial communication lines between high-ranking US officials and Russia.\n\nShe acknowledged that she worked with two Americans and a Russian official. \n\nCNN identified the Russian citizen as Alexander Torshin, a former deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was targeted with US sanctions.\n\nOne of the US citizens has been identified in US media as Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based conservative political activist who was in a relationship with Butina.

            "test_query": "Gun rights activist Maria Butina, 30, admitted a single count of conspiracy at a court in Washington DC.\n\nShe allegedly tried to infiltrate the National Rifle Association (NRA) in an effort to influence US policies in favour of Moscow.\n\nButina initially pleaded not guilty. She has been in custody since July. \n\nShe has also agreed to co-operate with investigators. Prosecutors expect the deal will give them information about Russia's efforts to interfere in US politics.\n\nHer lawyer, Robert Driscoll, estimates that she could face up to six months in prison, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nShe is being held at an adult detention centre in Virginia, and a sentencing hearing has been set for 12 February.\n\nThe case has no connection with the Mueller inquiry into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election in an attempt to secure victory for Donald Trump.\n\nWho is Maria Butina?\n\nBorn in the southern Siberian city of Barnaul in 1988, according to her Facebook page, she has enjoyed using weapons ever since she was a child, picking up a gun for the first time at the age of 10.\n\nIn 2011, she set up the Right to Bear Arms group and called for the sale of short-barrelled firearms to civilians to be made legal.\n\nButina began travelling to the US for NRA conventions. In 2015 she attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas, asking the presidential candidate about his views on US sanctions against Russia.\n\nBy 2016 she had a student visa to study for a master's degree at American University in Washington DC.\n\nA piece of a larger puzzle\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher in Washington\n\nIn some ways, Maria Butina was like any other young, ambitious, aspiring political player in Washington DC trying to network their way to power and status. The difference, of course, is that she was a Russian national in communication with, and taking actions to advance the interest of, influential Russian officials. \n\nTo do so without registering with the US government is a federal crime - and now she faces a prison sentence and deportation.\n\nThe details outlined in the plea agreement are not exactly the stuff of spy novels. She arranged a Russian delegation to a prestigious Washington prayer event, hobnobbed at the National Rifle Association convention and organised a visit by US gun rights advocates to Moscow. Taken in isolation, these\"informal channels of communication\"with American conservatives could have helped improve US-Russia relations but were hardly nefarious.\n\nViewed in the context of other Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election presented by Robert Mueller's investigation - including hacking Democratic Party communications, waging an illicit social media campaign, and funding and organising on-the ground political rallies and protests - and the Butina plea seems more like a small but potentially meaningful piece of a much larger puzzle.\n\nWhat are the accusations against her?\n\nFederal prosecutors said Butina was directed by a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative political groups, including an unnamed pro-gun lobbying organisation presumed to be the NRA, which is close to Mr Trump's Republican party.\n\nIn a statement read in court, one of the federal prosecutors said Butina had drafted, in March 2015, a document called\"Diplomacy Project\"that called for unofficial communication lines between high-ranking US officials and Russia.\n\nShe acknowledged that she worked with two Americans and a Russian official. \n\nCNN identified the Russian citizen as Alexander Torshin, a former deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was targeted with US sanctions.\n\nOne of the US citizens has been identified in US media as Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based conservative political activist who was in a relationship with Butina. He is listed in public records as being 56 years old. His lawyer has not commented.\n\nLast week, government lawyers dropped what the judge said was a\"salacious\"allegation that Butina had offered sex in exchange for a position in a special interest group.\n\nProsecutors told the court that they had been been\"mistaken\"when they read a text conversation between two friends.\n\nAnalysts say this and other errors by prosecutors may have given Butina more leverage in reaching a plea deal.\n\nThe Russian government has previously described the case as\"fabricated\". \n\nIn an interview with CNN, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Butina had been\"tortured\"in detention - without providing any evidence - and that the Russian government considered her a\"political prisoner\".",

A government newspaper publishes alongside non-state titles. \n\nTIMELINE\n\nSome key date in Guinea-Bissau's history:\n\n1446-47 - First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879. \n\n1974 - Independence following a guerrilla war.\n\n1980 - Country's first president, Luis Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by Joao Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.\n\n2006 - Guinea-Bissau soldiers battle Senegalese rebels along the southern border.\n\n2006 - Guinea-Bissau appeals for international help to stop people-traffickers using its remote coastline to smuggle migrants, including Asians, to Europe.\n\n2007 - Donors have one last opportunity to save Guinea-Bissau from chaos and to combat Latin American drug cartels, the UN and International Monetary Fund warn.\n\n2010 - US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.\n\n2011 - EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law.

But it says journalists face harassment.\n\nPrivate radio stations operate alongside the state broadcaster. A government newspaper publishes alongside non-state titles. \n\nTIMELINE\n\nSome key date in Guinea-Bissau's history:\n\n1446-47 - First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879. \n\n1974 - Independence following a guerrilla war.\n\n1980 - Country's first president, Luis Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by Joao Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.\n\n2006 - Guinea-Bissau soldiers battle Senegalese rebels along the southern border.\n\n2006 - Guinea-Bissau appeals for international help to stop people-traffickers using its remote coastline to smuggle migrants, including Asians, to Europe.\n\n2007 - Donors have one last opportunity to save Guinea-Bissau from chaos and to combat Latin American drug cartels, the UN and International Monetary Fund warn.\n\n2010 - US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.\n\n2011 - EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law.

On Giglio itself, only about half the land area is protected, and none of the seas around the shore.\n\nOther islands further to the north and west - Elba, Pianosa, Montecristo - contain more natural riches.\n\nTo the east on the mainland, lies the Laguna di Orbetello, an important bird reserve.\n\nA little further north is the Natural Park of Maremma - the only Italian habitat for at least one dune-dwelling plant, a stopover point for migratory birds, and the location for a successful reintroduction of osprey.\n\nElena Moutier, a scientific consultant working at the park, told BBC News that an oil spill there\"would be a disaster\".\n\n\"The Maremma Park is one of the most important regional parks in Italy, for the landscape, the ecosystem and the richness in endemic species of plants and animals,\"she said.\n\nHowever, all of this is in the realms of the potential, not the actual.\n\nAs far as we are aware - and sources including the salvage company Smit and environmental group WWF concur - there has been no fuel spillage so far.\n\nThere has been a fair amount of confusion about what material is on board, with some reports saying the Concordia runs on heavy fuel oil and others citing diesel.\n\nThat's a crucial point if there is a spill.\n\nWhile relatively light diesel would disperse fairly quickly in a swelling sea, heavy fuel oil is clumpy and clinging, as we saw in the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010.\n\nThe answer is that the ship contains both.

The process involves drilling holes at the highest and lowest points of the tanks and fitting valves to them.\n\nSeawater exerts pressure from the bottom, forcing the oil up and and out of the top valve.
