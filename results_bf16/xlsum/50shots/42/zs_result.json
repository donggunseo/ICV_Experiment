They had no income or job.\n\nSo, they said, they would like to come to work at Panda Security.\n\n\"I did not want, at that moment, to say no,\"said Mr Corrons. \n\nHe told them that being behind the mariposa botnet is not something that would work in their favour.

Taiwan, however, considers itself an independent country.\n\nWhat is Taiwan's relationship with the WHO?\n\nAylward's reaction was widely seen as indicative of the awkward relationship the WHO has with Taiwan, which is not allowed to be a member state.\n\nWHO membership is only given to countries that are members of the United Nations - which does not recognise Taiwan - or whose applications are approved by the World Health Assembly. \n\nWhat this means is that Taiwan has been excluded from emergency meetings and important global expert briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.

One-way through areas have been introduced, with clear plans for queuing in case entrances and exits are closed. \n\nNetwork Rail says the rail industry is keen for passengers to wear face coverings while travelling.\n\nHowever, while it might be relatively easy to limit the number of passengers on an inter-city train, it will be more difficult on commuter trains where stops are frequent and passenger turnover is high.\n\nHow will public transport in London be affected?\n\nTime spent waiting for trains and buses is almost certain to rise. \n\nLondon has a population of nearly nine million, and more than 60% of commuters in the city use public transport, compared with 7% in the UK as a whole. \n\nA report, seen by BBC London, says that if social distancing is to be maintained on the London Underground, only 50,000 passengers could board every 15 minutes. That compares with 325,000 normally boarding every 15 minutes at the peak of rush hour before lockdown.\n\nTransport for London (TfL) lost 90% of its income after passenger numbers plummeted. It now has \u00a31.6bn in emergency funding to keep Tube and bus services running until September, with a full Underground service resuming as soon as possible.\n\nEmployers are set to be asked to stagger the beginning and end of their working day in order to stop the transport system from being overwhelmed. \n\nTfL is to introduce one-way systems, safety signs and announcements, and hand sanitiser dispensers to help people to keep to social distancing measures.\n\nIt will also regularly update guidance on the 20 busiest stations to help people to avoid those areas.\n\nOther measures being considered to manage London's public transport system include:\n\nTaking a bus may also involve longer waits at the bus stop - it's thought that social distancing may mean that buses normally able to carry 85 people would be limited to 15. \n\nShould I drive to work? \n\nMost journeys in Great Britain are already taken in cars - in 2018 alone, the distance covered was an estimated 435 billion miles.\n\nMotor vehicle use in Great Britain fell by two-thirds from March to April, particularly after lockdown was introduced on 23 March.\n\nHowever, cars have remained the most-used transport and there have been week-on-week increases since the lockdown began.\n\nBefore the lockdown, most commuters were already driving to work.\n\nThe one exception is London, where the congestion charge is being reintroduced to avoid a build-up of traffic.\n\nAcross Great Britain, the Department of Transport (DfT) estimates 68% of people travel to work in a car, but that still means millions take public transport into their workplace.\n\nHowever, government guidance recommends that individuals stop carpooling, which around 10% of commuters in cars currently do.\n\nWill it be easy for me to cycle?\n\nCycle manufacturers say that sales of bikes have risen sharply during the lockdown, so this seems likely. \n\nTfL says it's working with the Mayor of London to accommodate a tenfold increase in the number of people cycling, and a fivefold increase in the number of pedestrians.\n\nAn immediate \u00a3250m package of measures has been announced by the DfT to encourage cycling and walking in England. The measures include pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle-only corridors. \n\nAnd a \u00a35m scheme has been unveiled in Greater Manchester to make the city safer for cyclists and walkers, while a major road in Brighton has been closed off to motor traffic. \n\nHowever, factors including access to bikes or perceptions of road safety could slow the take-up of cycling.

In the UK the figure was 1.2% in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"The study found little evidence in the literature and stakeholder consultations to suggest that the main motivation of EU citizens to migrate and reside in a different member state is benefit-related, as opposed to work or family-related\", the study by consultants ICF-GHK said.\n\nIt looked at non-contributory cash benefits across the EU and access to healthcare - that is, benefits that do not depend on a person's national insurance contributions.\n\nEU membership gives citizens across the 28-nation EU the freedom to move to another EU state, work there and claim benefits, though conditions vary considerably from country to country. Most EU countries are in the Schengen zone, where border checks are minimal.\n\nUK concerns\n\nThe new study was based on survey data, including case studies, and national administrative records. The consultancy pointed out, however, that there is a lack of official data on non-active EU migrants, so many of the figures are estimates.\n\nIn the UK much debate has focused on migrants' access to the National Health Service, which provides universal care and is funded by UK taxpayers.\n\nAccording to the EU study, non-active EU migrants account for 0.2% of total health spending in the EU, on average. \n\nResponding to the study, a spokesman for UK Prime Minister David Cameron said there was\"widespread and understandable concern\"about benefit tourism and the UK was working with other EU countries to change the rules on access to benefits.\n\n\"There is an issue around access to the welfare system, around fairness as well as a cost issue...

All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead.\n\nIn the days following the January 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan\"Je suis Charlie\"(I am Charlie).\n\nThe magazine has marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked protests in several Muslim countries.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has since defended the freedom of the press and the French\"freedom to blaspheme, which is linked to freedom of conscience\".\n\nWhat is happening at the trial?\n\nEleven of the defendants were present in the courtroom on Wednesday. They gave their names and occupations, and all confirmed they intended to answer questions from the court.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of the victims were also in court. Gala Renaud, the wife of one of the journalists killed, told reporters that you could\"already feel the tension\".\n\n\"I wanted to see the defendants in the box to see what they look like,\"she said, adding that she wanted to know\"what their motivations were, why this complicity and of course why innocent people were killed\".\n\nThe trial has been delayed by almost four months because of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, the presiding judge said France's lockdown measures had made it impossible to bring together\"all the parties, witnesses and experts under the necessary sanitary conditions\".\n\nThe alleged accomplices are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attack on Charlie Hebdo's office on 7 January 2015, as well as the subsequent attacks on a police officer and the Hyper Cacher supermarket.\n\nThree of the suspects are believed to have disappeared in northern Syria and Iraq and will be tried in absentia.

More than five years have passed, but much remains to be explained about how the attacks were prepared.   \n\nThe full extent of any co-operation between the Charlie Hebdo attackers and the supermarket gunman, for example, is not at all apparent. Nor is it clear what co-ordination there was with leaders of the groups to whom they paid allegiance - al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State.\n\nAnother aspect that will be highlighted is the link between Islamist terror and petty delinquency in the high-immigration suburbs.\n\nWhat happened in 2015?\n\nOn 7 January that year, two French Muslim gunmen - brothers Ch\u00e9rif and Sa\u00efd Kouachi - stormed the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo in the Rue Nicolas-Appert before opening fire on its staff. \n\nThe magazine's editor at the time, St\u00e9phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb, was among four celebrated cartoonists who were killed. \n\nThe gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor.\n\nIn a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris.\n\nHe had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city.\n\nSecurity forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages.\n\nWho are the accused?\n\nThey include 35-year-old Ali Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. \n\nMicka\u00ebl Pastor Alwatik's DNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene. Mohamed Fares has told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, while Amir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf, Willy Prevost and Christophe Raumel are accused of having provided support.\n\nTwo people in Belgium - garage owner Metin Karasular and his associate Michel Catino, an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage owner Miguel Martinez and his associate Abdelaziz Abbad - are accused of supplying\"assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests\"to the three gunmen.\n\nOn trial in absentia is Hayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive.\n\nA female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp.\n\nMohamed and Mehdi Belhoucine are accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq. Mohamed Belhoucine also provided email addresses used by the other defendants.\n\nWhy was Charlie Hebdo targeted?\n\nThe radical weekly magazine was well known for taking swipes at the French establishment and religion and has long drawn controversy.\n\nCartoons of the Prophet Muhammad brought Charb death threats as well as 24-hour police protection prior to his death. There was also a petrol bomb attack on the magazine's offices in 2011.\n\nThe publication has also been seen as a beacon for free speech, with many of its defenders using the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie to defend it.\n\nCharb strongly defended the Prophet Muhammad cartoons as symbolic of freedom of speech.\"I don't blame Muslims for not laughing at our drawings,\"he told the Associated Press in 2012.\"I live under French law.

There were more serious assaults and the number of assaults and serious assaults against staff also rose,\"he said.\n\n'Squalid cells'\n\nThere were not enough resources available to cope with the size of the prison population - which had increased to 87,000 - Mr Hardwick said.  \n\nYet between March 2010 and December 2014 the number of full-time staff in public sector jails had dropped by 29% from 45,080 to 32,100, he said.  \n\n\"It can't go on like this,\"said Mr Hardwick.\"Prisons can't be immune from the language of priorities.\"\n\nA typical week in the prisons\n\nSource: Safety in Custody Statistics from Ministry of Justice quarterly update\n\nThe inspector also criticised a lack of rehabilitation of prisoners, despite government promises of a\"rehabilitation revolution\". \n\n\"It is hard to imagine anything less likely to rehabilitate prisoners than days spent mostly lying on their bunks in squalid cells watching daytime TV.\n\n\"For too many prisoners, this was the reality and the'rehabilitation revolution' had yet to start,\"he added.\n\nMr Hardwick said he had spoken to Justice Secretary Michael Gove about the problems, adding:\"The ball is in the Secretary of State's court and he needs to respond to that.\"\n\nPrisons minister Mr Selous said:\"The safety of our staff as they deliver secure prison regimes is our priority and we are tackling dangerous new psychoactive substances to help drive down the number of assaults and violent incidents.\n\n\"Our prisons must punish those who break the law, but they should also be places where offenders can redeem themselves.\"\n\nJuliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said it was\"no mystery that violence, self-harm and suicide rise when you overcrowd prisons, reduce staff by almost one-third, cut time out of cell and purposeful activity\".\n\nThe report does not include prisons in Scotland or Northern Ireland, where services are run under devolved powers.", "gt": "Prisons in England and Wales are in their worst state for 10 years, with increasing violence, the chief prison's inspector has said in an annual report.", "prediction": "nick hardwick, the outgoing chief inspector of prisons, has released a report criticizing the state of prisons in england and wales, citing rising violence, self-harm, and staff attacks. he blames government policies, including staff cuts and reduced prison regimes, for the deterioration. the report gives prisons their lowest overall grade since the assessment system began in 2005."}, {"input_prompt": "Your objective is to generate a concise and coherent summary of a given news article.

On Giglio itself, only about half the land area is protected, and none of the seas around the shore.\n\nOther islands further to the north and west - Elba, Pianosa, Montecristo - contain more natural riches.\n\nTo the east on the mainland, lies the Laguna di Orbetello, an important bird reserve.\n\nA little further north is the Natural Park of Maremma - the only Italian habitat for at least one dune-dwelling plant, a stopover point for migratory birds, and the location for a successful reintroduction of osprey.\n\nElena Moutier, a scientific consultant working at the park, told BBC News that an oil spill there\"would be a disaster\".\n\n\"The Maremma Park is one of the most important regional parks in Italy, for the landscape, the ecosystem and the richness in endemic species of plants and animals,\"she said.\n\nHowever, all of this is in the realms of the potential, not the actual.\n\nAs far as we are aware - and sources including the salvage company Smit and environmental group WWF concur - there has been no fuel spillage so far.\n\nThere has been a fair amount of confusion about what material is on board, with some reports saying the Concordia runs on heavy fuel oil and others citing diesel.\n\nThat's a crucial point if there is a spill.\n\nWhile relatively light diesel would disperse fairly quickly in a swelling sea, heavy fuel oil is clumpy and clinging, as we saw in the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010.\n\nThe answer is that the ship contains both. Smit's figures are 2,400 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 200 tonnes of diesel; the manufacturer of the ship's engines told BBC News that they are\"fuel flexible\".\n\nFor comparison, said Simon Boxall from the UK's National Oceanography Centre, the fuel oil consignment is equivalent to\"about half of a day's output\"from the Deepwater Horizon disaster\"when spewing oil at the full rate\".\n\nBut the ship's proximity to the coast means a spill would be\"damaging\", he said. \n\nSmit's experts and equipment are now in place near the stricken ship, and are ready to begin extracting the oil. The process involves drilling holes at the highest and lowest points of the tanks and fitting valves to them.\n\nSeawater exerts pressure from the bottom, forcing the oil up and and out of the top valve. The sticky oil is encouraged to flow by using heat from a steam generator on a nearby barge.\n\nThe process could take two to four weeks.\n\nThe big risk in the meantime would be if the vessel began breaking up.\n\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday morning, contractors were optimistic that it would not.\n\nThe seas are said to be calm; and although the Concordia is perched in coastal shallows with the potential to tumble into deeper waters, Smit believes it's unlikely to move.\n\n\"Based on the first underwater pictures, there are quite a number of [hull] penetrations on the starboard side,\"operations manager Kees van Essen told reporters.\n\n\"They are acting as an anchor; so although we never underestimate the danger, the chance of the vessel sliding down into deeper water is minimal.\"\n\nIn case of spillages in the meantime, the site is surrounded by booms - although as Deepwater Horizon proved, their utility as barriers can be substantially less than promised.\n\nPerhaps the closest recent comparator is the Rena, the container ship that struck New Zealand's Astrolabe Reef in October.\n\nAgain, the site was in an area of outstanding ecological importance. And the pounding seas eventually broke the ship in two.\n\nNevertheless, the incident fell a long way short of constituting an environmental disaster - mainly because salvage operators were able to pump out the vast majority of the oil.\n\nSo far, the indications are that the Concordia may prove even less damaging - at least from an environmental point of view.\n\nIn both cases, there's a wider question.
