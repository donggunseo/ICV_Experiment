Health conscious consumers were looking for alternatives to dairy and to soya.\n\nAnd over the years that has turned into a boom, from meat-free burgers to dairy-free cheese, you can find pea proteins in all sorts of foods - you can even drink pea\"milk\".\n\nHistorical trends\n\nFor decades soya beans have been the main supply of plant-based protein, but since the turn of the millennium, it has been falling out of favour.\n\nSome people are simply allergic to soya, so they needed something else.\n\nOther consumers, particularly in Europe, were put off by the fact that soya protein is often derived from genetically modified soya crops.\n\nAlso hexane, a solvent derived from oil, is typically used to extract protein from soya beans. While the industry says virtually all of the chemical is eliminated before soya protein reaches the market, for some consumers the use of hexane was a deal breaker.\n\nSo pea protein, which doesn't require chemicals during the production process, has become an attractive alternative.\n\nAlso the source crop, yellow field peas, are plentiful and liked by farmers.\n\n\"Peas are a real nice crop, they're pretty easy,\"says Bill Gehl, whose family has been farming in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, for three generations. \n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nThe relatively dry weather suits the production of fields of pulses - peas, beans and lentils are common in his province.\n\nBill says farmers like the yellow field pea because, like other legumes, it transfers nitrogen from the air into the soil, making it more fertile. \n\nThere is also a financial incentive:\"The big thing is you can make money out of it,\"says Mr Gehl.\n\nAlthough peas don't yield as much produce as wheat for every acre, the price per bushel is typically higher and they don't need as much fertilizer to grow.\n\n\"They [peas] haven't been as susceptible to the downturn in the global economy as maybe some of the other pulses,\"he adds.\n\nThe demand for Bill's peas is likely to be supported by the boom in demand for pea protein.\n\nHenk Hoogenkamp, an adviser to food companies on pea protein technology, expects the industry to produce between 340 and 350 tonnes of pea protein next year - an increase of a third on this year. \n\nProcessing plants are opening at a rapid rate to supply demand. Over the summer Puris received a $75m (\u00a360m) investment from US food giant Cargill, which will allow it to double its production of pea protein with a new plant in Minnesota.\n\nThe early demand was for pea protein was in powder form - used as a supplement in shakes and drinks. \n\nBut in recent years it has been incorporated in more and more products.\n\n\"The market has taken off like nothing you have seen before,\"says Mr Hoogenkamp, who advises food companies on pea protein technology.\n\nHe says he gets a least one phone call a week from companies looking to get into pea protein.\n\nThere is demand from firms making plant-based\"meat\"products and dairy-free yoghurts, cheese and milk.\n\nPerhaps the best known is Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based meat products, and this year floated on the stock market, worth $1.5bn.\n\nMr Hoogenkamp says the rise of plant-based proteins has caught the traditional, or legacy, food giants by surprise.\n\n\"Only three years ago the legacy industry was laughing at these companies. They are not laughing any more.\"\n\n\"The millennial generation has basically woken up and their tastes are rather dramatically changing in affluent countries, substituting animal for plant-based proteins.\"\n\nGreen support\n\nEnvironmental groups support plant-based proteins, hoping that their rise will curb meat consumption.\n\n\"The world's top scientists have consistently said we need to more than halve our meat consumption to prevent climate breakdown,\"said Richard George, head of forests at Greenpeace. \n\n\"Pea protein is undoubtedly one option among many. Changing our eating habits won't be easy, but the more options we have, the better our chance of success.\"\n\nBut the rise of pea protein needs to be kept in perspective.\n\nGlobal meat consumption is running at 330 million tonnes a year, a million times greater than the annual output of pea protein.\n\nAnd with meat consumption expected to continue to grow, the humble pea is likely to remain pretty humble for a while yet.", "reference": "When Tyler Lorenzen first started to sell protein powders derived from peas he received some \"odd looks\".", "prediction": "Puris, a family-owned business, developed pea protein in 2013.

Five years ago, properties were evacuated as waves crashed onto the promenade. \n\nIt seems as good a place as any to take a look at what impact climate change may be having on communities.\n\nIts university is also the base for scientists who are researching the wider climate issues - and how we might adapt.\n\nAnd travel along the nearby Dyfi estuary and you find some of Wales' most important nature reserves and wildlife, which are vulnerable.\n\nAlun Williams, cabinet member for carbon management in Ceredigion, said rising sea levels were threatening its flood defences.\n\nThe local authority is trying to plan how to manage the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nStood on the shingle ridge which acts as a barrier between land and sea at Tanybwlch beach near Aberystwyth, Mr Williams said:\"The sea is overtopping this bank much more regularly than it used to - it's just a matter of time before it breaks through and moves inland.\"\n\nRising sea levels and more frequent storms mean there are fears this defence could soon be breached.\n\nIt is an example of how global warming is already affecting Wales - the country's 1,680 mile-long (2,700km) coastline is on the frontline, leaving local authorities like Ceredigion with difficult decisions to make.\n\nMr Williams highlighted one area where the waves have carried an avalanche of pebbles down into the River Ystwyth on the other side of the ridge. Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

The closure of the accident and emergency unit at the town's Alexandra Hospital is among the options being considered to achieve savings across Worcestershire's hospitals totalling \u00a350m.\n\nAlmost 6,000 people signed a petition last weekend alone as the campaign gathers pace to save Redditch's A&E.\n\nKaren Lumley tells us:\"The danger is our people will have nowhere to go in an emergency. Birmingham's QE is 12 miles away. We need to retain emergency services in Redditch.\"\n\nSo how can this be happening when NHS budgets are supposed to be protected?\n\nLocal health managers say even within ring-fenced budgets, the measures are necessary to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and with what they call the legacy of debts caused (and I'm sure you are ahead of me here) by private finance initiatives.\n\nI will be talking live to Karen Lumley on this weekend's Sunday Politics. \n\nWe will also be joined by Labour's deputy leader in the Lords, and former health minister and, before that, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath.\n\nAnd I hope you will join me too, at our usual time of 1200 BST on BBC One on Sunday, 1 July 2012.", "reference": "\"It's PFI or bust!\" So said the then newly-appointed Labour health minister Alan Milburn back in 1997.", "prediction": "The article discusses how Conservative MPs are now criticizing Labour for the burden of debts caused by Private Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which Labour adopted from the previous Conservative administration.

I'd had the most awful night's sleep and I'd just started watching The Lion King.\n\n\"It didn't even get past the intro before my bedroom door flew open and 10 police officers came in to arrest me.\n\n\"I was not expecting that on any day of my life.\"\n\nThe police were there for a good reason: when he was 16, Jack had stolen personal information from about 1,000 people.\n\nHe told police he'd never had any intention of using it for his own gain; to him, it was just an intellectual exercise.\n\nStories like this are not uncommon at Bluescreen IT, which has a direct link with the police to find hackers in need of direction.\n\nThese are young men who have been accused of serious crimes, but instead of being taken through the criminal justice system, they've been given a second chance.\n\nAbout 15 people work in the Security Operations Centre, a handful of whom have been referred to the company as hackers who aren't malicious in nature and are deemed capable of reform.\n\nAnother employee, Cameron, was arrested on his way to school when he was just 14 years old.\n\nOfficers from the National Crime Agency had planned the sting so that Cameron would be out of the house, and unable to destroy his hard drives in the event he heard them coming.\n\n\"Up to that point my biggest worry was that I hadn't done my maths homework,\"he said.\n\n\"I was walking to school when I heard my name being called. I turned round and there was a man in a suit walking behind me.\n\n\"Then I heard him say my name louder, so I turned around and said'yeah?' and that's when he told me I was under arrest.\n\n\"I turned around and there were five more officers spread out across the grass.\n\n\"I just didn't realise that what I'd done was that serious. It was all just one big joke - messing around - it never seemed like I was actually causing any real harm. I soon found out how serious it was.\"\n\n\"Grey hat hackers\"like Jack and Cameron are seen as having committed their crimes for reasons that weren't to do with personal gain or cyber-terrorism. Sometimes it might have been a practical joke, or perhaps the motive was to launch a server-debilitating attack.\n\nNow they try to stop others - using the methods they once employed - from wreaking the same havoc.\n\nHackers' hats\n\nWhite hat hackers - These are the nice guys of the hacking world. They know what they're doing and they use their talents for good, such as getting rid of viruses or legitimately testing the security systems of companies and governments.\n\nBlack hat hackers - The bad guys. They're the ones who steal your bank details and sell them on the dark web. They usually hack for personal gain, although it could be some form of cyber-espionage or protest.\n\nGrey hat hackers - Somewhere in between. They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them. What they're doing is still illegal.\n\nThe route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.\n\nWhen he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked.\n\n\"I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them.\"\n\nHe started making\"mods\"to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet.\n\n\"I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency,\"Cameron said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nFor Jack, now 23, it was his\"laziness\"that led him into the world of computing.\n\n\"I was 12. We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it. \n\n\"I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra. It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things.\n\n\"I was trying to cut corners any way I could. Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well. \n\n\"I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute. After a while the school had had enough of me.\n\n\"I got my five GCSEs in Year 10 and then the school expelled me.\"\n\nJust four years after his arrest, Jack is now working at an advanced level, carrying out processes like penetration testing - trying to break into clients' servers to find weaknesses.\n\nHe and Cameron, now 19, also defend against incoming attacks - an area where their hacking experience comes in handy.\n\nOne of the more surreal moments in Cameron's first year at Bluescreen was going on the same course as the police officer who had arrested him in 2014.\n\nDet Sgt John Atkin from the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit was attending a Bluescreen security course as part of his own professional development.\n\nCameron said:\"It's unbelievable - what are the chances of that?\n\n\"I never would've thought when he was arresting me as a 14-year-old kid, that we'd one day be on the same course.\n\n\"There's an element of learning from each other now. Whenever something comes up in forensics he's the man to explain it best; we're lucky to have him there.\n\n\"And then for the attacks I can explain it better.\n\n\"We always got along, but I don't think John appreciated much of what I did.\"\n\nDet Sgt Atkin has\"no problem\"meeting the hackers he's arrested because the whole point of the police Cyber Futures programme is to\"try and develop people\".\n\n\"What you can see here is that by working with Cameron and his family, and providing the support and knowledge we have, we're able to deliver and put him in a place where his future is set, rather than where he could have been.\n\n\"Cameron's a good kid so he's doing really well; the future's bright for him. Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster.\"\n\nThere's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.\n\nThree monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.\n\nThe clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like\"Black Mamba\"or\"Green Starfish\"- usually a colour and an animal.\n\nThe business has just won part of a \u00a3500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.\n\nAs apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about \u00a3650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nBut for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.\n\nNow they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.\n\nIt's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with.\n\n\"It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve,\"said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore.\n\n\"We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that.\n\n\"It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle.\"\n\nBluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go.\n\n\"It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications,\"said Mr Cashmore.\n\n\"It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying.\"", "reference": "Step inside the offices of Bluescreen and you'll find some of the UK's most talented young hackers, dragged from a world of crime to fight for the other side.", "prediction": "A company in Plymouth, called Bluescreen, employs hackers who were once involved in malicious activities but have been given a second chance.

Torfaen and Caerphilly councils were the worst hit in the past year, with costs of \u00a3247,176 and \u00a3132,431 respectively.

In a previous series, for example, we discovered you can cut the calories in pasta by cooking, cooling and then reheating it. \n\nThat was a very pleasing result. But our most recent discovery, finding bacteria which appear to be producing a novel form of antibiotic, feels altogether more significant. What was particularly delightful was that they were found growing in someone's beard.\n\nBeards, as you may have noticed, are back. The chin-strap, the goatee, the neck beard and the Van Dyke, they all have their fans. But with beards sprouting everywhere, like new grass in the spring sunshine, there has inevitably been a backlash. \n\nCritics claim that beards are not only an irritating affectation but can potentially harbour unpleasant bugs.\n\nSo, what's the evidence that beards pose any sort of health risk? Pogonophobes, people who fear beards, had those fears confirmed by a recent study in New Mexico where they found traces of enteric bacteria, the sort usually found in faeces, in randomly sampled beards.\n\nAs one newspaper put it:'\"Some beards contain more poo than a toilet.\"\n\nBut is this typical? A recent and rather more scientific study, carried in an American hospital, came to very different conclusions.\n\nFind out more\n\nTrust Me I'm A Doctor is on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 20 January - catch up on BBC iPlayer\n\nIn this study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, they swabbed the faces of 408 hospital staff with and without facial hair.\n\nThey had good reasons for doing so. We know that hospital-acquired infections are a major cause of disease and death in hospitals, with many patients acquiring an infection they didn't have when they went in. Hands, white coats, ties and equipment have all been blamed, but what about beards?\n\nWell, the researchers were surprised to find that it was the clean-shaven staff, and not the beardies, who were more likely to be carrying something unpleasant on their faces. \n\nThe beardless group were more than three times as likely to be harbouring a species known as methicillin-resistant staph aureus on their freshly shaven cheeks. MRSA is a particularly common and troublesome source of hospital-acquired infections because it is resistant to so many of our current antibiotics.\n\nSo what's going on? The researchers suggested that shaving might cause micro-abrasions in the skin\"which may support bacterial colonisation and proliferation\".\n\nPerhaps. But there was another more plausible explanation staring them in the face. That beards fight infection.\n\nUnlikely? Well, driven by curiosity we recently swabbed the beards of a random assortment of men and sent them off to Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist based at University College London, to see what, if anything, he could grow.\n\nAdam managed to grow over 100 different bacteria from our beards, including one that is more commonly found in the small intestine. But, as he quickly explains, that doesn't mean it came from faeces. Such findings are normal and nothing to worry about.\n\nA brief history of beards\n\nFar more interesting, in a few of the petri dishes he noticed that something was clearly killing the other bacteria. The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe.\n\nWe see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics.\n\nPenicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon.\n\nPurifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics.\n\nAs he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years.\n\nAs well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel.\n\nSurprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.", "reference": "If you were in search of a new, disease-fighting antibiotic, where might you start?

They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population. \n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. The two-year study towards infectious disease elimination on the Bijagos Islands was funded by UK Research and Innovation.\n\nProf James Logan is head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.  However, younger trees (10-30 years old) are at greater risk and can succumb to the disease in just a few years.\n\nDrs Straw and Williams described BCD as a\"much more serious threat\"because the\"rate at which the disease has spread through the horse chestnut populations has shown no sign of slowing down in recent years, and it is still too early to say how many trees will be killed eventually and how many might survive\".\n\nContrary to the opinion that trees with foliage damage caused by leaf miners would be more susceptible to BCD and help accelerate its spread, Dr Straw said the decade-long study did not support such a view.\n\n\"Trees that have heavily damage foliage by the leaf miner do not get the (bleeding canker) disease more often and they do not suffer from it any more severely so we cannot see that the impact of the leaf miner is causing sufficient stress in the trees to make them more susceptible to the disease,\"he explained. \n\n\"The two organisms seem to be operating independently.\"\n\nDr Straw said Forest Research scientists had been concerned by attempts to treat horse chestnut trees with insecticides in order to curb the spread of leaf miners.\n\n\"This was based on the argument that by controlling the moth you would help stop the trees from becoming infected with bleeding canker disease,\"he added. \n\n\"What we have shown is that there is no point doing that. There is no point controlling the moth because it will have no influence on whether the trees pick up the bleeding canker disease or not.\n\n\"What tree management needs to do is focus on the threat posed by the bleeding canker disease.\"\n\nDr Straw said that Forest Research was continuing to monitor the trees in the study area to see if the long-term project offered any clues on how far and how fast BCD would spread through the UK's horse chestnuts and whether there were any individual trees that showed a natural resistance to the pathogen.", "reference": "Horse chestnut trees infested with foliage-damaging leaf miner insects are not at greater risk from a bacterial disease, a study shows.", "prediction": "A study conducted by Forest Research found that the horse chestnut leaf miner has no significant impact on trees' resistance to bleeding canker disease, contrary to initial concerns.

It is also a dangerous escalation in a region that was already tense and full of violence.\n\nThe killing at Baghdad airport has increased tensions sharply, creating fears of a slide into an all-out war. That is no certainty. Neither the Americans nor the Iranians want one. But the crisis brought on by the killing of Soleimani - and a senior Iraqi ally - amplifies the chances of a bloody miscalculation.  \n\nIran has sworn vengeance. That threat has to be taken seriously. Soleimani was at the core of the regime, and a talisman for Iran's hardliners. They will want to get even, perhaps more than that. \n\nProxy forces\n\nDespite arms embargoes, Iran has developed a modern arsenal of rockets and missiles. But if it wanted to use them against US forces as part of a reprisal, Iran would risk making matters worse.\n\nAn act of war to answer that of the US - for example attacking US ships in the Gulf - would risk provoking a devastating response. Iran's oil refineries are on the coast and would be easy targets for the vast firepower the US has in and around the Gulf.\n\nWhen Iran retaliates, it is likely to follow Soleimani's own indirect tactics: so-called asymmetric warfare, spurning an attack through the front door for one through a side window. \n\nSoleimani cultivated a range of well-armed militias, which give Iran options short of a head-to-head confrontation with the Americans which it would only lose.  \n\nThe Americans will now be looking at their most vulnerable deployments in the Middle East. One is the small force in Syria.\n\nCalculated risk\n\nA big question is why the Americans chose now to kill Soleimani.\n\nHe had been a thorn in their sides since at least the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. He made sure Iraqi Shias raised, trained and equipped militias which became effective and ruthless fighters against the US and its allies.  \n\nThe Americans and their allies in Israel and the West have tracked Soleimani closely for years. It's likely that he has been in their sights before. \n\nThe fact that this time the Americans pulled the trigger suggests that President Trump believes the reward is worth the risk, that the Iranian regime has been so weakened by isolation, economic sanctions and recent demonstrations that it will rage but not offer a serious strategic threat. \n\nBut it is not at all clear whether the assassination fits into a coherent US strategy, and such an assumption could be dangerous and wrong. \n\nSoleimani was a colossal figure inside Iran. He was its strategic mastermind. Perhaps he left a plan of steps to take if he were killed. \n\nThis assassination at the start of a new year and a new decade might turn into another Middle Eastern milestone, touching off another sequence of bloody events. \n\nTo begin with, the Iranian regime must now be planning its answer to his death, to show that the position Soleimani spent so long creating outside its borders in the Middle East can be defended.", "reference": "The assassination of Qasem Soleimani has plunged Iran and the United States into their most serious confrontation since the hostage crisis in 1979.", "prediction": "President Donald Trump's decision to kill Soleimani has escalated tensions in the Middle East, with Iran vowing revenge and the US military facing increased danger.

so the level of detail will be limited.\n\nSecrets spilled\n\nEach head will want to discuss how they see the threats and explain what their organisation is doing to counter them.\n\nThe three spy chiefs are all different characters.\n\nThe chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers - often known as\"C\"rather than M - spent most of his career in the Foreign Office; so he is not a stranger to the TV cameras.\n\nAndrew Parker, from MI5, is new in the role but has been in the upper echelons of MI5 for many years.\n\nSir Iain Lobban, of GCHQ, faces the hardest task.\n\nHe has been running his agency for longer than either of the others but historically it has been the most secret and the least outward-facing.\n\nOr at least it was until the past few months, when former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began spilling its secrets, drawing its work into the spotlight as never before. \n\nThe spies have already been giving evidence to the committee in private for many years and that is where the real detail will be discussed.\n\nBut the decision was taken recently that this was no longer sufficient.\n\nThirty years ago, the intelligence agencies existed almost entirely in the dark.\n\nThere was no legal footing for them and no form of accountability - other than ministerial sign-off - until 1994.\n\nThe names of the heads of the organisations would not even have been widely known.\n\nSnooze factor\n\nThe spies began to speak in public in the 1990s in carefully controlled settings but this hearing marks a significant milestone.\n\nModern concerns such as terrorism and cyber-security are inherently more public-facing than the kind of monitoring of the Soviet Union that occupied so much time in the Cold War.\n\nPublic notions of transparency also mean the days of staying out of the limelight have gone.\n\nAmerican spy chiefs do appear before Congress publicly but the hearings can be pretty anodyne.\n\nWhen the British committee watched some recordings of their US counterparts some of them had second thoughts about going public - they feared the snooze factor might be too much.\n\nSo a key question will be how far the members of the ISC want to go in challenging the spy chiefs and giving them a hard time.\n\nThat is important because it is not just the spy chiefs who people will be watching closely.\n\nThe committee itself is also under scrutiny and this performance will be crucial in defining whether it really is capable of holding the intelligence agencies to account. \n\nIts performance in the decade after 9/11 has been criticised.\n\nA number of key controversies have swept through Britain's intelligence community - Iraq's absent weapons of mass destruction, whether the 7 July 2005 London bombings could have been prevented, and the UK's involvement in the rendition and transfer of detainees, to take the three most high-profile.\n\nBut in each of these areas, the ISC has underperformed.\n\nPatchy record\n\nThe details about Iraq came out thanks to the Butler Inquiry and now the Chilcot Inquiry - not the ISC's own report.\n\nOn 7/7, the committee had to go back and re-report after gaps in its initial findings. \n\nAnd, on rendition, the record is also decidedly patchy.\n\nThe ISC's initial conclusions were challenged by evidence about British resident Binyam Mohamed who spent four years at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nIts findings was also called into question more recently over MI6's involvement with the transfer of two men to Libya - evidence which emerged thanks to the collapse of the Gaddafi regime rather than the oversight of the committee.\n\nThe Snowden affair has raised new questions - including about whether the committee was too quick to defend spies rather than oversee them.\n\nThe past problems were acknowledged by the committee's chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, when he took over in 2010 and a number of reforms were introduced under the Justice and Security Act.\n\nThe ISC can now demand information rather than request it and its remit has been extended formally to cover operations rather than just the management of the agencies. \n\nThe committee's investigators can go into the agencies and look for material rather than take what they are given  - something they have already done.\n\nParliament - rather than No 10 - is also being given more power over the composition of the committee itself.\n\nFinally, we have the public hearing itself -  the most visible sign that, in the spy world, times have changed.", "reference": "When Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) quizzes the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies later it will be the first such meeting in public.", "prediction": "The UK's intelligence agencies are to give evidence before parliament for the first time in an open hearing.
