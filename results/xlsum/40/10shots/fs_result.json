Though the concept was discredited by'picking winners' in the seventies, it is now growing in attractiveness.\n\nThe prime minister's own advisers are working on similar ideas, and I know of one influential Tory minister who has also told the chancellor the time has come for the Tories to set an industrial strategy.\n\nMany Tory backbenchers agree.\n\nFactory standards\n\nSo now Heseltine will carry out the diagnosis that any industrial policy would first of all need: a competitiveness audit.\n\nHeseltine's review may look at every aspect of the British state, not just industry.\n\nHe is said to be exercised by competitiveness in\"the wider British political economy\". So that's pharmaceuticals, green technology, the media industry but maybe also road provision, banks, supermarkets.\n\nBusiness bodies like the CBI may be examined for whether they promote competitiveness. Does the CBI do as much to promote competitiveness in the UK. Is it as helpful as its sister organisations in Germany?\n\nIn particular, Heseltine is said to be exercised by standards - so for instance in Germany, standards in factories are, he is said to think, much higher than in Britain's factories and as a result people are more keen to buy German parts. They are more reliable.\n\nIn the 1990s, Heseltine set up a competitiveness unit with 30 members and many cabinet ministers sat on its committee. This has since been disbanded... But the audit may find a need for its reinstatement.\n\nWhen I worked for Michael Crick, my predecessor as Newsnight political editor, we sometimes discussed how the then crop of politicians shaped up to previous ones.\n\nMichael wrote a great biography of Heseltine and always mentioned his subject's indefatigability. Years later Heseltine is driving city mayors and the regional growth fund and now this. He's turning into one of the prime minister's most important advisers.\nTL;DR: \"If that light shines on uncomfortable truths, so be it\".\n\nArticle: Marc Weinstein used a fake press pass to get next to the stage for the historic New York show.\n\nThe only other photographer present ran out of film during the gig.\n\nWeinstein's 61 black and white images with copyright fetched \u00a330,680, compared with a pre-sale estimate of \u00a315,000-\u00a320,000, Omega Auctions said.\n\nShea Stadium was The Beatles' biggest concert - and the biggest ever pop concert by any group up to that date.\n\nIt came at the height of Beatlemania and the band's music was famously drowned out by the screams of the 55,000-strong crowd.\n\nWeinstein later recalled how he used a home-made press pass to con a policeman into escorting him to the stage area.\n\n\"I just blended with everybody there,\"he said.\"I had a method of operation; I just acted like I belonged.

The Orange Order has applied to march along Donegall Street past St Patrick's Catholic Church. \n\nLooking ahead to the parade, ACC Kerr said:\"Northern Ireland cannot afford an eleventh-hour solution.\"\n\nThe senior policeman said he did not believe the violence was officially sanctioned by any loyalist paramilitary groups, but he said members of these groups had been involved in the trouble.\n\n\"The community of north Belfast needs to see a resolution to this issue now,\"said ACC Kerr.\n\n\"Collectively, we cannot afford to wait and we cannot have night after night of violence on our streets.\"\n\n4 September\n\nA number of fireworks and other missiles were thrown at police lines during further disturbances.\n\nPolice moved in after a crowd of about 200 people gathered in the Denmark Street area at about 22:00 BST.\n\nA police inspector suffered a hand injury during the third night of disturbances, which lasted about an hour.\n\nEarlier that evening, a spokesman for the Methodist Church said it was unacceptable for First Minister Peter Robinson to have kept silent on recent events in north Belfast.\n\n\"The people of NI expect leadership from their government to help alleviate tensions and bring peace back to our streets, but the first minister has done nothing except sign an anti-Parades Commission letter which does little to instil confidence on both sides of our, sadly, still-divided community,\"he said.\n\n5 September\n\nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, described talks about parades as\"positive and constructive\".\n\nThey met north Belfast politicians to discuss the ongoing tensions in the area, while an Orange Order delegation met privately with Mr Robinson.\n\nIn a joint statement, the two men said:\"We are very encouraged by the determination of all those who attended today's meeting to work together to agree a way forward. \n\n\"All agreed that there is no place for violence.\n\n\"There is a recognition that all the interested parties, not just politicians, have a role to play in the parades issue.\"\n\n6 September\n\nThe Royal Black Institution apologised\"for any offence caused\"to clergy and parishioners of St Patrick's Catholic church in Belfast during its parade on 25 August, when loyalist bands played music outside the church in defiance of a ruling by the Parades Commission.\n\nThe Institution said its anger was directed at the Parades Commission, not the Catholic church.\n\nParish priest Fr Sheehan said:\"I welcome this positive development and the sincere Christian spirit behind it.\"\n\n7 September\n\nThe Orange Order announces it is taking part in behind-the-scenes talks to reduce parading tensions ahead of the Ulster Covenant commemorations on 29 September.\n\nIt said talks were taking place\"to address issues that have arisen in relation to peaceful protests against the Parades Commission\". \n\n10 September\n\nThe priest at St Patrick's Church, Fr Sheehan, offers to hold talks with the Royal Black Institution so they can meet with members of the church. \n\nHe said they have an opportunity to demonstrate with generosity and goodwill that it is possible to reach local agreement.\n\n17 September\n\nThe Orange Order said bands taking part in an Ulster Covenant parade will play hymns when passing the Catholic Church where trouble flared. \n\nThe decision follows talks with clergy and parishioners of St Patrick's Church and community leaders. However Orangemen refused to speak directly to the Carrickhill Concerned Residents Association.\n\n18 September \n\nNorth Belfast residents are to meet the Parades Commission later ahead of the Ulster Covenant parade. \n\nCarrick Hill Concerned Residents Association said they would not speak publicly until after the talks.\nTL;DR: Three nights of trouble at a sectarian interface in north Belfast followed growing tensions surrounding a series of contentious parades.  \n\n\n\nArticle: It came after government calls to\"top up\"tanks were blamed for panic-buying at petrol stations in some areas, with drivers ignoring calls not to queue.\n\nHigh demand caused some garages to run dry but retailers said usual deliveries would ensure supplies were replenished.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband called on the PM to apologise for the\"shambles\".\n\nSome 90% of UK forecourts are supplied by about 2,000 tanker drivers in the Unite union, which is threatening a strike over their working conditions and pay.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ed Davey said people did not need to change their behaviour\"very significantly\".\n\n\"People just need to do the sensible thing if they're going into the petrol station.

simply salt, which reduces the melting temperature of ice, and an anti-caking agent.\n\nThis is enough to see councils\"through the harshest of winters\", according to Dilwyn Jones, of the WLGA, which represents local authorities in Wales.\n\nThe Welsh Government, which subcontracts motorway and trunk road gritting to councils, said it spent on average \u00a35.4m on rock salt and its delivery in the past five years.\n\nPrices can vary\"dramatically\", Mr Jones added, for example if we have a particularly harsh winter or there are shortages of salt.\n\nMost local authorities buy salt from a salt mine in Cheshire - the UK's largest - while some buy it from Northern Ireland.\n\nWales has almost 22,000 miles (35,405km) of road, including almost 2,800 miles (4,506km) of motorway and A-road.\n\nAnd according to analysis by the Ordnance Survey, you are never further than 2.6 miles (4.2km) from a road in Wales.\n\nThe extent to which our landscape is dominated by roads, when coupled with our reliance on salt to keep them safe, has an impact on the natural world, according to Dr Forman.\n\n\"Amphibian populations are declining, particularly in ditch systems and on the edge of roads,\"he said.\n\n\"Sites can become so heavily laden with salt that the amphibians are unable to spawn, and either leave or die.\"\n\nThose creatures at risk include frogs, toads and tadpoles, he said, and the way amphibians maintain chemical balance is through their skin.\n\nAny changes to the salinity - or saltiness - of the water they inhabit can have a drastic effect on their ability to survive, and the problem is more pronounced in Wales, as Dr Forman explained.\n\n\"Because Wales is a western facing country, our amphibians come out much, much earlier and start spawning around January, February or March.\n\n\"It does get cold and can snow at that time of year so gritters can be out in force during that time.\n\n\"All of our amphibians aren't doing particularly well and the use of rock salt is a contributing factor.\"\n\nAnd there are other effects too.\n\nDr Forman said salt can affect a plant's ability to photosynthesise (produce energy from light), and the increased salinity of soil near inland roads has changed habitats.\n\n\"In Wales, you are seeing coastal plants growing on road verges in mid Wales,\"he said.\n\n\"For example, Danish scurvy grass, wild carrot, and bladder campion would traditionally be found on the cliffs and coastline of Wales.\"\n\nThere is also evidence salt water run off from roads can find its way into groundwater, contaminating the water supply, according to research carried out by Cardiff scientist Dr Mark Cuthbert.\n\nMr Jones accepted rock salt\"can have negative effects on aquatic ecosystems\", and that\"at high concentrations, salt can be fatal to some aquatic animals\".\n\nBut, he added\"snow and rain dilutes the effect and it is generally considered to be an acceptable and cost-effective way of keeping roads safe in icy and wintry conditions\".\n\nSo what are the alternatives?\n\nThe Welsh Government said there is\"no current compelling argument\"that the amount of salt currently used for de-icing damages the environment.\n\nA spokesman added there has been a move towards\"pre-wetting\"- mixing salt into water before spreading - which reduces the amount required.\n\nDr Forman does not dispute the need to keep the roads safe, but wants to see a move away from the use of salt as a de-icer.\n\n\"There are alternatives to rock salt, so there is a move now to use sawdust, sand and other material which can be mixed with rock salt, reducing the amount of salt used,\"he said.\n\n\"We need to look at these alternatives.\"\n\nThis story was inspired by a reader's question.\n\nWhat questions do you have about Wales, its people and places? \n\nIs there anything you've always wanted to know?\n\nUse this form to send us your questions: \n\nYour contact information\n\nPlease don't publish my name\n\nI am over 16 years old\n\nI accept the Terms of Service\n\nIf you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic. \n\nWe may get in touch if we decide to follow up on your suggestion.\nTL;DR: Using rock salt to de-ice roads is harmful to wildlife and alternatives should be explored, a scientist says.\n\nArticle: The Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of the most recognisable river crossings in the world.\n\nIt is a symbol of Australia and an icon of engineering - but it was made more than 10,000 miles away in a small Teesside town at the top of the North Yorkshire coast.\n\nNow the Redcar steel works have been mothballed due to a slump in global steel prices blamed on the cheap of Chinese-made metal.\n\nIt is not the first time in recent history the Redcar site, which currently employs about 2,000 people plus many thousands more in the supply chain, has been closed.\n\nAbout 1,700 jobs were lost when the plant's then owners, Indian firm Tata Steel, closed the works in 2010.\n\nBut two years later the furnace, the second largest in Europe, was re-lit and steel production started again under Thai-based Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI).\n\nTrade unions have said a new loss of the steel works would be devastating for Teesside.\n\nPaul Warren of the union Community said:\"Staff are absolutely worried to death. People are putting their homes up for sale, looking at different jobs for next week, worried about holidays they've got booked, how they are going to pay bills, it's absolutely devastating.\"\n\nA short history of the Redcar steel works\n\nThe steel works were founded in Redcar in 1917 by Dorman Long, the company which went on to design and build the Sydney Harbour bridge in the 1930s.\n\nThe plant then became a part of British Steel, the nationalised steel company formed in 1967.\n\nIn 1999, British Steel merged with Dutch company Hoogevens under the name Corus.\n\nEight years later the site was taken over by Indian firm Tata Steel, which produced about 3.4m tonnes each year at the plant.\n\nThree years later 1,700 jobs were lost when the firm lost a large contract and the furnace was switched off.\n\nIn 2011 the site was taken over by Thai company Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), which re-lit the furnace to much fanfare in 2012.\n\nHistorian Joan Heggie agrees the impact on Teesside is disastrous. \n\nBut she also believes loss of the works will have a much wider impact on British manufacturing.\n\n\"The impact of steel-making closing down on Teesside would be quite considerable,\"she said.\n\n\"It is an immense employer here.

2010, 7,142 people died prematurely due to poor air quality in the north of England.\n\nThe researchers used data from 2004 to 2010 and found that exposure to poor air quality was responsible for 1.5

highest rate of premature deaths due to poor air quality in the UK, accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths from air pollution in the country.\n\nThe study also found that children under the age of 15

We were the first to shut down and we will be the last to reopen,\"Alok Tandon, the CEO of multiplex chain Inox, told the BBC last month. Many of India's nearly 10,000 cinema halls closed in March, just as coronavirus cases had started to appear and even before the government imposed a lockdown. \n\nIndia continues to reopen, despite having the second-highest caseload in the world. \n\nOn Thursday, just as film theatres in several states welcomed customers, India's health ministry confirmed 680 deaths in the last 24 hours, its lowest in nearly three months. Daily averages of case numbers have also dipped in recent weeks, but experts say any slowdown must be greeted with caution.\n\nAfter a long summer with no movies on the big screen, opening up cinemas is largely a symbolic and\"feel-good move\", says Rakesh Jariwala, a media and entertainment analyst.\"The thinking is hopeful - like the idiom goes, build a city and people will come,\"he adds.\n\nBut watching a movie in a cinema won't be the same, at least in the foreseeable future. There will be no eager crowds or long queues at the ticket counter as social distancing is enforced. Names and phone numbers will be collected at the entrance for contact tracing. And no hall will run full as seating is capped at 50%. Even popcorn will be sterilised under UV rays for eight minutes, reported local media.\n\nBut the biggest blow is the lack of new material - for months, cinemas watched helplessly from the sidelines as streaming platforms snapped up Bollywood movies that were willing to opt for an online release. This leaves cinemas with no option but to re-release older titles, including those from 2018. \n\nThe problem, according to film critic Saibal Chatterjee, starts there.\"People aren't dying to go back and watch old films - why would we spend our money and take a risk? Who would go with their family and potentially expose them?\"\n\nBut studios remain reluctant to let go of new films just yet.\"It's a vicious circle - people won't come unless a big blockbuster releases, but producers won't release a big movie unless people come,\"Komal Nahta, a film and trade analyst, says.\n\nOn Thursday, movie theatres in India struggled to attract customers with many running shows for small audiences, reported the Associated Press. \n\nIndia's thriving south Indian film industry hasn't been spared either - releases of upcoming Tamil and Telugu films have been delayed after a halt in shooting.\n\nA similar parallel can be drawn overseas too, where a popular American movie chain recently announced that it would temporarily close hundreds of locations in the US and UK due to a lack of blockbusters to screen. \n\nAs of now, two big Bollywood extravaganzas have held out - Sooryavanshi, an action-packed police spectacle steered by superstar Akshay Kumar, is set to release in early 2021, while'83, a tribute to India's cricket World Cup victory in 1983, is due to have a Christmas showing. There are rumours that a sequel to a 2005 hit, Bunty Aur Babli, will release in mid-November, just in time for the Hindu festival of Diwali, often celebrated by both fireworks and a blockbuster. \n\nThe industry is banking on such releases to draw customers and ramp up sales. But it might not be enough to recoup their eye-watering losses - now pegged at around $1.2bn (\u00a3930m).\n\n\"It's going to be a very long-drawn process,\"adds Mr Nahta.\"In the short term, they're only staring at losses.\"\n\nBut first, cinemas have to rebuild confidence and dispel fears.\"This is a dry run - there are no new movies but it's a chance to lay the groundwork, enforce all the measures and hope that cinemas don't see cases,\"says Mr Chatterjee. \n\nMultiplex owners have said they will implement every precaution. But other public spaces that are back in action, such as restaurants or gyms, have seen low footfall. \n\nOwners are hoping that India's reputation as a movie-obsessed country, one which sold just over a billion tickets in 2019 and produces the most movies in the world, might help tide things over until new releases trickle in. And even though streaming is growing in popularity in India, experts say cinemas may do well in smaller cities and towns where streaming services are nascent and Covid-19 case numbers are fewer.\n\n\"Movie-going runs in the blood of this nation,\"Vikram Malhotra, CEO of Abundantia Entertainment, says.\"This is the classic Indian middle class activity - the day out with family.\"\n\nBut\"from a purely epidemiologist's perspective, this is the wrong time to open,\"says virologist Dr Jacob John. Cinemas are at greater risk than other public spaces of becoming breeding grounds for the virus.\"There's not much ventilation, the air is recycled by air conditioners and since it's dark, no-one will really check if everyone is wearing a mask,\"he adds.\n\nJust because the doors have reopened, doesn't mean they can't close again, with experts fearing that even a single case within cinema halls could prompt a shutdown.\"For the first time, the health of the film industry will not be governed by the content, but by the health of the public,\"says Mr Nahta.\nTL;DR: Cinemas have reopened in India after a seven month-long break forced by Covid-19.

Even if he is convicted by the Vatican City Court, he will not be sent to prison until an appeal takes place, which could take months.\n\nMr Gabriele, a 46-year-old father of three who worked his way up in the Pope's domain from a cleaner's job to the post of butler, valet and sometimes - if we are to believe him - close confidant of the pontiff, spent nearly two months in a police cell and just over another two months under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of aggravated theft.\n\nHe appeared in court smartly dressed in a pale grey suit and answered the presiding judge's questions on the second day of the trial precisely and fully.\n\nFrom the evidence before the court, the butler emerges as a rather devout Catholic believer who until this year was regarded by the small community of men and women who make up the papal household as totally trustworthy. He kept the keys to the papal apartments, and had access to the entire top floor of the Apostolic Palace where Pope Benedict lives, sleeps and takes his meals. \n\nWhen the Pope travelled, Mr Gabriele was seated in the Popemobile beside the driver. When it rained he held a white umbrella to prevent the Pope from getting wet. He was the Pope's shadow, the layman with closest access to the pontiff.\n\nHis position afforded him considerable prestige inside the Vatican where he still lives with his family in a modest\"grace-and-favour\"apartment only four minutes walk from his job.\n\nTension in court\n\nHe told the court that because of the\"evangelical imprint\"of his duties, he felt obliged to help other Vatican employees who did not enjoy the privilege of such close contact with the pontiff. He said he was often waylayed on his short walk back home by colleagues asking him to hand in a petition or a letter to the Pope because of the privileged position he enjoyed inside the Pope's immediate entourage.  \n\nSometimes, he said, he would ask for a driver to take him directly back home to avoid the embarrassment of having to refuse such favours.\n\nMr Gabriele's body language in court sometimes betrayed tension, and when Monsignor Gaenswein - Pope Benedict's private secretary and his immediate superior - was giving evidence, the two mens' eyes never met. \n\nThe butler sprang to attention both as Monsignor Gaenswein entered and exited the small wood-panelled courtroom. The secretary had been the first to confront Mr Gabriele with the accusation that he was the person who had been leaking confidential Vatican documents to the Italian media.\n\nWhat the trial has not revealed so far is the real motive behind Mr Gabriele's apparent betrayal of the Pope's confidence, nor whether any Vatican senior clerics were involved in the most serious internal security breach suffered by the Holy See in living memory. \n\nVatican police officers gave evidence that when they searched Mr Gabriele's study in his home, they found one large cupboard stacked from floor to ceiling with a disorderly jumble of documents taken from the Pope's office over a period of years. \n\nThe documents included original letters initialled by the Pope indicating that he had read them personally, many photocopies, flash sticks and computer disks, and the results of thousands of internet searches on such varied subjects as Freemasonry, espionage, secret agents, yoga and Buddhism. Police said the material seized from Mr Gabriele's home filled 82 cardboard boxes of a size typically used by house movers.\n\nThe Vatican decided early on to speed up the criminal proceedings by reducing the accusations against the butler to a single charge of\"aggravated theft\". Originally, the prosecutor had raised other possible charges of conspiracy, crimes against the Vatican City State, defamation and revealing state secrets (all Vatican employees are required to swear an oath of secrecy regarding everything they see and learn in the course of their duties).\n\nAfter the defence and prosecution have made their summing up on Saturday morning, the three judges will retire to consider their verdict and pass sentence.\nTL;DR: Five months after his arrest on charges of stealing thousands of pages of secret correspondence and documents from Pope Benedict's private office in the Vatican, his former manservant Paolo Gabriele is about to learn his fate.\n\nArticle: By Andrew HardingAfrica correspondent, BBC News\n\n\"It's a theoretical concern. A reasonable concern\u2026 that the South African variant might be more resistant,\"Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, told the BBC. \n\nProf Madhi was responding to comments by the UK government and scientists. He said a definitive answer would probably come in a matter of weeks, with extensive testing already under way in South Africa. \n\nThe concern arises from the fact that the virus here has mutated far more than the variant in the UK, and one of those mutations might mean it can evade attack by antibodies that would normally fight coronavirus. \n\nVaccines teach the body to mount an immune response - which includes creating antibodies - to fight the coronavirus, should it ever encounter it. \n\nAntibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick to the surface of viruses, effectively disabling them. If that ability to connect is weakened, then the antibodies created following the introduction of a vaccine might not be as effective.\n\nProf Madhi said it was\"unlikely\"that the mutation in South Africa would make the current vaccines useless, but might\"weaken the impact\".\n\nA vaccine expert at Wits University, Prof Helen Rees, said:\"Fortunately, should further modifications of the vaccine be required to address the new variants, some of the vaccine technologies under development could allow this to be done relatively rapidly.\"\n\nSouth Africa recently pushed back against suggestions from the British government that its variant was more transmissible than the one in the UK. Scientists insist there is no evidence of that, nor that the mutations here have made the virus deadlier.\n\nProf Rees said concern about the mutations in South Africa should add to global pressure for a swift roll-out of vaccines across the world, and not just to wealthier nations.\n\n\"As the new variants are already spreading to other countries, the importance of ensuring that vaccines remain effective against new variants is a global imperative,\"said Prof Rees.\n\nProf Barry Schoub, who chairs the government's advisory committee on vaccines, said the\"preliminary evidence\"from tests did not suggest that mutations would allow the virus to\"escape\"the impact of the current vaccines. \n\n\"The vaccines seem to be very effective,\"he said, citing laboratory tests that appeared to show the current vaccines still\"neutralise this new variant\".\n\nProf Madhi said the crucial laboratory experiments were yet to start and the efficacy of the vaccines would only be known\"over the next few weeks\".\n\nYou might also be interested in:\nTL;DR: Scientists in South Africa say there is a \"reasonable concern\" that the new variant of Covid-19 sweeping across the country might prove to be more resistant to current vaccines being rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, and warn that it makes the need for a global roll-out of vaccines \"even more critical\".\n\nArticle: With his band The Mindbenders, the Manchester-born singer broke into the UK top five in 1964 with Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um.\n\nThey hit number one in the US and number two in the UK the following year with Game Of Love.\n\nBut he left to go solo later that year, reputedly quitting in the middle of a concert.\n\nAfter going solo in 1965, he went on to have top 20 hits with Pamela Pamela and Come On Home.\n\nDJ Tony Blackburn paid tribute on Twitter, writing:\"So sorry to hear about the passing of great 60s icon Wayne Fontana yesterday.

If we need to manoeuvre it we will.\"\n\nIndia is the fourth country to have carried out such a test.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi announced the test - Mission Shakti - with great fanfare on 27 March, saying it had established India as a\"space power\".\n\nIn an address to employees, Mr Bridenstine sharply criticised the testing of such anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons.\n\nHe said that Nasa had identified 400 pieces of orbital debris and was tracking 60 pieces larger than 10cm in diameter. Twenty-four of those pieces pose a potential risk to the ISS, he said. \n\n\"That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris in an apogee that goes above the International Space Station. And that kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see have happen.\"\n\nA day after India successfully carried out its ASAT test, acting US defence secretary Patrick Shanahan warned that the event could create a\"mess\"in space but said Washington was still studying the impact. \n\nDelhi has insisted it carried out the test in low-earth orbit, at an altitude of 300km (186 miles), to not leave space debris that could collide with the ISS or satellites.\n\n\"That's why we did it at lower altitude, it will vanish in no time,\"G Satheesh Reddy, the chief of India's Defence Research and Development Organisation, told Reuters in an interview last week. \n\nMr Bridenstine said that it was true that this would eventually happen.\"The good thing is, it's low enough in Earth orbit that over time this will all dissipate,\"he said. \n\nChina provoked international alarm with a similar test in 2007. The Nasa chief said\"a lot\"of the debris created by that test remained in orbit. The US military is in total tracking about 10,000 pieces of space debris, nearly a third of which is said to have been created by the Chinese test. \n\nArms control advocates have expressed concern about the increasing militarisation of space. ASAT technology would allow India to take out the satellites of enemy powers in any conflict, and the test is likely to fuel the growing regional rivalry between India and China.\n\nThe announcement also angered opposition parties in India, who have accused Mr Modi of using the test as a political stunt ahead of a general election.

worse-than-expected 2.9% in year-on-year terms, the steepest decline since 1998.\n\nExports, which account for nearly 40% of the economy, were the biggest drag as they fell by the most since 1963.\n\nIn recent weeks official figures have confirmed that both Japan and Singapore have also gone into recession.\n\nBut South Korea's finance minister Hong Nam-ki remains optimistic that the economy will recover swiftly.\n\n\"It's possible for us to see China-style rebound in the third quarter as the pandemic slows and activity in overseas production, schools and hospitals resume,\"Mr Hong said.\n\nThe South Korean government has so far implemented about 277 trillion won (\u00a3181bn; $231bn) worth of stimulus measures to tackle the effects of the pandemic on its economy.\n\nHowever, authorities in the trade-reliant nation have very little control over exports, ranging from computer memory chips to cars.\n\nIn another indication of how Covid-19 has hit the

showed that Singapore had fallen into recession as second quarter GDP shrank 12.6% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nAuthorities forecast it will be Singapore's worst recession since its independence from Malaysia in 1965.\n\nBut last week, China said it had avoided falling into recession as its economy grew by 3.2% in the second quarter of the year after a record slump in the previous three months.

She added that under the Children and Families Bill local authorities will be\"required by law to tell adopters what support is available\".    \n\nHowever Alexandra Conroy-Harris, of British Adoption and Fostering, said the bill did\"not go far enough\"to ensure a statutory right for support for adoptive parents.  \n\n\"Unless these children and their adoptive families are properly supported there is a high risk these difficulties will not improve and ultimately the placement may break down. This can only result in more damage to the child as they return to care.  It also leaves the adoptive parents devastated.\"\n\nCllr David Simmonds of the Local Government Association, said:\"Local authorities know from experience that support from their local council, health services and schools, is crucially important for adoptive mums and dads, particularly those who are giving a loving home to children who may have had a difficult start in life. \n\nExtra money\n\n\"For adoptive parents to receive the quality and level of support they need, it will be important that government matches any new statutory duty placed on local authorities with the extra money needed to provide it while making sure we still have the flexibility to tailor support to the particular needs of individual families.\"\n\nThe committee also warns that adoption is not necessarily suitable for all children in care and says that the government's focus on driving up adoption numbers should not be at the expense of other ways of providing permanent homes, for example permanent fostering, guardianship or care by family and friends. \n\nIt also cautions that the drive to increase adoption should not undermine efforts to keep birth families together and calls for more monitoring to determine how many adoptions break down and why.\n\nThe government spokeswoman responded:\"We know adoption is not right for every child. Driving up the skills of social workers will allow them to judge what is best for each child. We are taking forward an ambitious programme of work to improve fostering services and we will shortly announce our reforms to residential care.\"\nTL;DR: Adoptive parents in England should have a

Players use core building components to create and share online worlds that anyone can explore. \n\nIt is free to play, relying on purchases paid for in currency known as robux.\n\nGame-makers earn robux, which can be converted back into cash. \n\nMore than 1,250 developers earned at least $10,000 in robux in 2020. More than 300 earned $100,000 or more.\n\nThe versatility of Roblox is a huge part of its success, thinks Louise Shorthouse, a senior games analyst at Ampere Research.\n\n\"It is not just a game, it is a platform to create games,\"she explains.\n\n\"It is a bit of a marketplace where you can pick and choose whether you play an adventure game, a shooter or a puzzle. And a lot of it is free to play, which is good for children.\"\n\nIt is available on a variety of devices, from PCs and Xbox to apps on iPhones and Android devices, allowing users to play each other regardless of which machine they are using.\n\nThere's pent-up demand for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch releases, too, so potentially, it has lots of further room to grow.\n\nLockdown provided a huge boost to Roblox, as children, physically cut off from their friends, flocked to it.\n\nNot only could they play games with their mates, they could visit virtual theme parks, attend concerts, birthday parties and chat to others.\n\nDaily active users jumped 85% in 2020 and it now has 37 million globally. \n\nThree in four US children aged between nine and 12 are on it, as is one in two UK-based 10-year-olds.\n\nAnd as of January, the number who played it at least once a month was just shy of 200 million, according to tracking site RTrack, marking a 67% increase on the same month a year earlier.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about Roblox is the amount of time people spend there - an average of two hours 36 minutes per day.\n\nBut with its huge growth in numbers and popularity, come issues. Scammers and hackers lurk, ready to steal kids' hard-earned robux, and there have also been reports of attempts to groom children.\n\nMetaverse meet-ups\n\nMr Baszucki's plans don't stop at gaming. He hopes Roblox can become part of that Metaverse, a series of interconnected digital worlds where people hang out, work and learn.\n\nThe term was coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 science-fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality-based successor to the internet.\n\nSimilar ideas have been around for a long time - gamers and game makers in particular have long dreamt of virtual worlds where they could live out their lives, and lockdown gave everyone a glimpse of such a life.\n\n\"The idea was amplified by the pandemic,\"said Ms Shorthouse. \n\n\"And even as we come out of it, online socialising is still going to be popular. \n\n\"It is about making a game into something more - a social space and entertainment venue.\"\n\nWriting in Wired at the beginning of the year, Mr Baszucki said:\"We will see a shift in the way people play, work, learn or simply hang out in 2021. Some of these connections will move into the Metaverse, a digital place where people seamlessly get together and interact in millions of 3D virtual experiences.\"\n\nMassive immersive virtual events will become the norm, he added, and push the boundaries of interactivity, changing the nature of live experiences. \n\nIt is, he writes,\"arguably as big a shift in online communications as the telephone or the internet\". \n\nPixelated parties \n\nGrand plans indeed, and a space that rival gaming platform Fortnite is also determined to get a slice of. \n\nIn September, developer Epic Games announced a three-week-long concert series that took place on the game's Party Royale island.\n\nNate Nanzer, Fortnite's head of global partnerships, said at the time he hoped it would become a\"tour stop\"for other bands. \n\nAs part of that, Epic built a studio space in Los Angeles, with a large LED wall and floor and remotely operated robocams. The hope for the future is to add mixed and augmented-reality effects to it.\n\nRoblox has been hosting its own parties - in November American rapper Lil Nas performed a virtual concern which was attended 33 million times - and the firm held an event for its own staff at Christmas, complete with nightclub and bar.\n\nDespite the experimentation, Ms Shorthouse thinks gaming will remain at its core.\n\n\"It is so strong in that space and a lot of people have stakes in it, with developers making a lot of money.\"\nTL;DR: David Baszucki, is about to become a very rich man, as his video-game platform, Roblox, floats on the New York Stock Exchange, valued at a cool $30bn (\u00a321.6bn).\n\nArticle: Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent\n\nMore than 70 million voters are eligible to cast their ballots for 243 assembly seats in the eastern state of Bihar. Polling began on Wednesday in the first of three phases and votes will be counted on 10 November. \n\nDuring a year when more than 60 countries postponed voting, authorities in India went ahead with polls in Bihar, which has a population comparable to Japan. \n\nTraditional forms of campaigning were suspended and virtual rallies were held initially. Polling stations and voting time have been increased to avoid congestion. But all this may well be too late: people and leaders alike have thrown caution to the wind in recent weeks and turned up enthusiastically - and unmasked - at huge public meetings. \n\nFrustrated authorities have warned politicians against flouting Covid-19 safety rules without much success - there are concerns over a spike in infection in a state which has reported more than 200,000 Covid-19 cases so far.  \n\nOne of India's poorest states, Bihar is a key electoral battleground. Its 124 million people are divided sharply along caste lines. With some two dozen home-grown parties, including 11 new ones, in the fray this time, the state is a crucible of alliance politics.\"The multiplicity of political parties makes things very complicated in Bihar,\"Suhas Palshikar, a leading political scientist, told me.\n\nBihar is also the only big state in India's sprawling and politically febrile\"Hindi-speaking heartland\"that the BJP has not won on its own. Narendra Modi's BJP has been in power for more than a decade as a junior partner in alliance with a regional party, the Janata Dal (United) or JD-U, led by Nitish Kumar, a powerful regional leader whose star may be on the wane. \n\nIndian voters traditionally punish incumbents. Despite two successive stunning wins in federal elections since 2014, Mr Modi's party itself has a mixed record in state elections - the BJP has lost more elections than it has won in the past six years. It has not won a clear majority in any state since polls in Uttar Pradesh four years ago. In the past two years, it has lost six state elections and gained power in one by cobbling together a majority with a regional rival-turned-partner. \n\nSo Bihar will be a test of the BJP's winning abilities, especially with tougher state elections scheduled for next year in Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.\"It is literally the last opportunity for the party to shine before the harder contests next year. Bihar will prove whether the BJP's streak of defeat at state level continues or not,\"said Gilles Verniers, assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University.\n\nMr Modi's government is accused of botching a sweeping lockdown to stall the spread of coronavirus at the end of March by forcing millions of out-of-work migrants to flee the cities and return to their villages. More than two million of these workers returned to Bihar. The election will tell us how voters have responded to the government's handling of the pandemic.  \n\nIndia's economy had stalled well before then: joblessness was high, farm prices were low and industrial production was crawling. The pandemic has ravaged poor economies like Bihar: unemployment rates have climbed above the national average, and remittances from migrant workers which accounted for a third of the state's revenues have dried up. \n\nStill most locals appear to blame Mr Kumar for not doing enough as chief minister to bring back stranded workers, instead of Mr Modi, whose hastily-executed lockdown triggered the exodus. One reason for this could be a rising tide of anti-incumbency against Mr Kumar, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term.\"The pandemic has exacerbated matters. Unemployment is a major issue. We have no idea how this will translate into votes,\"says Prof Vernier.\n\nMany believe the contest is wide open. Mr Kumar, who has ruled Bihar for 15 years and leads the coalition, is trying to buck anti-incumbency. Ranged against him is a rainbow coalition, led by the regional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which in turn is led by a young dynast son of the once-powerful Laloo Prasad Yadav, now serving a jail term for corruption. To add to this complex alphabet soup of parties is the small caste-based Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which has broken away from the ruling coalition and is fighting on its own. \n\nMr Kumar is now one of Mr Modi's closest allies. He has built his reputation as an astute populist who has provided basic amenities, curbed crime and controversially banned liquor in a state blighted by crippling feudalism and endemic misrule. But jobs remain scarce and there is growing voter fatigue. This time, Mr Kumar appears to have been overshadowed by Mr Modi, a leader who possibly evokes more hope.  \n\nThe election, according to political scientist Rahul Verma, will mark the beginning of the eclipse of an old guard of stalwart regional leaders - including Mr Kumar - who have traditionally shaped Bihar's politics. The BJP clearly senses that its time may have come to lead a winning coalition.\"The BJP has been slowly rising in Bihar on the back of the JD (U). A party which used to be a marginal player in Bihar has piggybacked on a regional partner and could well emerge as the single largest party this time,\"says Mr Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi-based think tank.\n\nSome believe the BJP's patchy electoral record in the states is not indicative waning popularity. The party has lost states because of local leaders who appear to lack charisma beside Mr Modi's larger-than-life, presidential personality.\"The BJP started from a low base in many states, and the beginning of the party's domination has just begun. They will keep losing elections - that's the nature of competitive elections. But electorally, they are still some distance away from the peak,\"says Mr Verma.\n\nIndia's state elections are fiendishly difficult to predict. Voters' choices are decided by a strange alchemy of caste loyalties, religion, chemistry between the rulers and the ruled and performance of incumbent legislators. A leading opinion poll has predicted a clear win for the ruling coalition led by Mr Kumar. But it also found that one in four voters were undecided about whom to vote for. A hung assembly is not ruled out.\n\nHow many seats Mr Modi's party wins on its own will be keenly watched. An uptick will confirm the BJP as the dominant player currently in Indian politics. A less-than-impressive performance will worry Mr Modi and provide a glimmer of hope for India's enfeebled opposition.\n\nFollow Soutik on Twitter at @soutikBBC\nTL;DR: India's first major elections since the beginning of the pandemic promise to be closely fought - and another test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity.\n\nArticle: The number of firms that expect business activity to be higher in the year ahead exceeded those that expected a decline by about 28%.\n\nBut, that net balance was lower than 39% in June and the lowest since the Markit Global Business Outlook Survey began in 2009.\n\nHiring and investment plans also dipped to post financial crisis lows.\n\n\"Clouds are gathering over the global economic outlook, presenting the darkest picture seen since the global financial crisis,\"said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in a statement.\n\nLong list of worries\n\nThe decline in optimism among businesses was due to a growing list of worries, according to the report.\n\nFears of a renewed downturn in the eurozone, the prospect of higher interest rates in the UK and US next year, along with geo-political risks from crises in Ukraine and the Middle East have all dented business confidence across the globe.\n\n\"A key factor that has held back economic growth in recent years has been the disappointing performance of major emerging market economies, and this looks set to continue, and perhaps even intensify, over the coming year,\"Mr Williamson added, citing that business optimism among the BRIC countries had sunk to its lowest since the financial crisis.\n\nRussia was the biggest concern among the leading countries as\"sanctions, a spiralling currency and uncertainty drove business expectations down sharply to a new low\".\n\nMost upbeat\n\nOn the bright side, UK companies were the most upbeat about the year ahead out of all the major countries surveyed in October.\n\nThat comes despite future business activity levels at its lowest since June 2013 for both the manufacturing and services sectors. \n\nUK firms were also the most optimistic about hiring plans among major economies. \n\n\"[The optimism] suggests the UK will continue to outperform its peers in 2015, albeit with growth slowing from that seen in 2014,\"Mr Williamson said.\n\nOn the downside was a surprise downturn in the US, where optimism hit a new survey low as the service sector saw a\"dramatic\"decline. \n\n\"US growth therefore looks likely to have peaked over the summer months, with a slowing trend signalled for coming months,\"he said.\nTL;DR: Global business confidence slipped to five-year low in October, according to a survey of 6,100 companies.\n\nArticle: A rise in the number of retirements, increased savings and the needs of the force have made it possible, says a report to police authority members.\n\nThe PCSO posts will be funded by the Welsh government.\n\nThe recruitment window for probationary constables opened on 21 November and will close next Monday, 5 December.\n\nThe North Wales Police Authority will discuss the update on recruitment at a meeting on Thursday.\n\nRecruitment for the PCSOs has already taken place, with 429 applications.\n\nThe report author, Inspector Peter Nicholson, said initial plans were for 10 new constables in 2012, but this has risen to 72 for the financial year 2012 -2013.\n\nInsp Nicholson said several serving PCSOs were expected to take up the opportunity to become  constables and once this recruitment process ended it was likely to produce further PCSO vacancies.\n\nOf the 429 applicants for the PCSO jobs, 116 went through the the interview stage of the recruiting process, with 48 of those women.\n\nThe first training course for the new PCSOs begins in January, with two further courses in March and May.\nTL;DR: North Wales Police are to take on 72 probationary constables and 106 police community support officers (PCSOs) as a recruitment freeze ends.\n\nArticle: Isaiah Haastrup suffered\"catastrophic\"brain damage after being deprived of oxygen at birth.

How Suga can transition from supporting to the main actor will determine how well the leadership transition can be managed.\"\n\nWho is Yoshihide Suga?\n\nBorn the son of strawberry farmers, the veteran politician comes from a humble background that sets him apart from much of Japan's political elite. \n\nThe 71-year rose only slowly within the political ranks. He first worked as a secretary for an LDP lawmaker before eventually embarking on his own political career, from city council elections to becoming a member of the Diet in 1996. \n\nIn 2005 he became a cabinet minister under Junichiro Koizumi and gained further influence in the subsequent Abe cabinet. \n\nAs Mr Abe's right-hand man, he gained a reputation for being efficient and practical and the outgoing prime minister strongly supported his ally's bid for the leadership. \n\nOne of his most prominent public appearances was when he unveiled the name of the new Reiwa era during the transition from Emperor Akihito, who abdicated, to his son Naruhito in 2019.\n\nYet as he takes over mid-term, many observers expect him to only serve out the remainder of that until a general election late next year. \n\nWhen he won his landslide within the LPD on Monday, all he needed was support from his own party. \n\nNext year's election, however, will put him in front of a general electorate -

People were just passing through and breathing in the fine spray.\"\n\nBut not everyone who walked past the hot tubs was infected by the legionella bacterium, he says.\n\n\"You have to be susceptible to it. There was a very low attack rate of 0.2% in the Holland example.\"\n\nPeople aged over 50 are more likely to be affected, as are people with existing health problems, particularly lung damage, and those who smoke.\n\n\"If your immune system is OK then you don't tend to get it,\"says Prof Phin.\n\nCleaning and maintaining the hot tub regularly is the only way to ensure that bacteria do not concentrate in the water and the spray, he explains.\n\nAs a result, the HPA has produced guidance on how to clean hot tubs and spa pools with chemicals which disinfect the water.\n\nIn general, cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing in number over the past 30 years. In the last 10 years, HPA figures show that cases have averaged 350 each year.\n\nThere is no knowing how many of these are due to hot tubs, because of the difficulty of finding the exact source of an outbreak.\n\nAround half of cases are linked to overseas travel.\n\nBut there are some other potential problems with hot tubs if they are not maintained properly.\n\nThe amount of skin that is shed in hot tubs can lead to cases of Pseudomonal infection and some people have also had boils appear on their bodies.\n\n\"If spa pools are not looked after properly then they can cause other diseases,\"Prof Phin says.\n\nLocal authorities will carry out inspections and private owners should make sure they use the appropriate chemicals to clean tubs and disinfect the water too.\nTL;DR: Hot tubs are known to be effective mechanisms for spreading legionella infection, an official at the Health Protection Agency said this week.\n\nArticle: A woman had her purse stolen by a man holding a knife on Douglas promenade on Saturday.\n\nIt happened between Broadway and Castle Mona Avenue at at about 01:00 GMT.\n\nCCTV taken from a building on Broadway about an hour after the attack has been published on the Isle of Man Constabulary Facebook page.\n\nThe force has described the man in the footage as a\"person of interest\", but declined to clarify if he was a direct suspect or a potential witness.\n\nAnyone who recognises him or has any information about the attack should contact police.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nIsle of Man Constabulary\nTL;DR: A man wanted in connection with a knifepoint robbery on the Isle of Man has been pictured in CCTV released by police.\n\nArticle: By David PittamBBC News, East Midlands\n\nDashcam footage shows Adrian Kowalski's truck being forced off the road by the Amazon vehicle at a roundabout just off the M1 in Barlborough, Derbyshire.\n\nMr Kowalski, 52, said he was left\"shaken\"by the apparent road rage pursuit on 18 November.\n\nAmazon said the driver was employed by a third party.\n\nMr Kowalski said the lorry had almost hit him at the previous roundabout because it was in the wrong lane.\n\nHe said the driver had followed\"inches behind him\", flashing the vehicle's lights and sounding its horn.\n\nAt the next roundabout Mr Kowalski said he was forced on to the verge to avoid being hit.\n\n\"I looked in my left mirror and saw this great big lorry bearing down on me and I thought,'wow',\"he said.\n\n\"I've driven for 35 years and never seen anyone in a lorry driving like that - I'm absolutely gobsmacked.\n\n\"I was frightened, shaken up.

It's short for purely obsessional OCD, a kind of OCD that doesn't involve the more traditional OCD traits like needing everything to be symmetrical and my bedroom is the messiest room you'll ever see.\n\nFor me, purely obsessional OCD is about reassurance seeking, or basically asking my poor mother over and over whether she is absolutely sure I'm not going to push her in front of a train.\n\nWhen living with OCD, it's easy to get lost and misled by a voice that isn't my own. The voice doesn't reflect my personality as it can be melodramatic, attention-seeking and downright mean. At its most extreme, it can generate false memories.\n\nA few years ago, when I finished my A-Levels, I went on a night out with friends. \n\nLuckily OCD has never affected my ability to get well and truly slaughtered in the fine British tradition. The after-effects of drinking for me, however, can extend well beyond your usual hangover anxiety.\n\nWhen I got home, I realised I'd over done it. I was due to go shopping in Birmingham with my sister the next day and knew that, without prevention, my plans would be derailed by a seriously vindictive hangover. \n\nI went to the kitchen, got a huge glass of water and took two paracetamol tablets - I was a bit drunk, but aware - and went to bed.\n\nI woke up the next day with a massive headache and lay motionless for a few moments.\n\nI ran through my memories of the night before to check whether I'd done anything so embarrassing I'd ruined my life. I watched myself come home, go into the kitchen, get the water and the paracetamol/\n\nAnd then it came, the intrusive thought...I had taken a whole box of paracetamol.\n\nIn my drunken stupidity I had taken all 24 tablets, maybe even more. I could feel the cardboard between my fingers, the sensation of swallowing each pill. I was in grave danger. If I didn't act quickly, I'd experience irreversible liver damage leading to certain death.\n\nThe panic rose, so did the nausea - evidence - I was dying. This couldn't possibly just be a hangover. \n\nI ran downstairs in search of the empty box or boxes, the abandoned packets on the counter.\n\nBut there were nothing lying on the counter. \n\nIn an uncharacteristic move I had actually cleared up after myself. I opened the cupboard and with overwhelming relief, saw the box of paracetamol with only two tablets missing. I was going to be fine.\n\nBut hang on. How could I be 100% sure that this box was the same box from last night? What if I had taken the tablets, drunkenly thrown the box in the bin and someone had gone out and bought another one? \n\nAs if by magic, there it was, another memory - the sound of the bin clanging shut. \n\nOh God. I was going to have to look in the bin.\n\nStorytelling Live: Lost and Found\n\nSarah was one of seven people with a disability or mental health problem to perform a story on the theme of lost and found as part of BBC Ouch's storytelling event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe - hosted by Chris McCausland. \n\nYou can watch the programme on BBC Two at 23:35 BST on Friday 23 August.\n\nIt will be available on iPlayer afterwards.\n\nI have never looked less like your stereotypical OCD sufferer than in that moment. I leaned over the bin, face down and trawled through mouldy cabbage and cheese.\n\nNo box in the bin. \n\nI had a brainwave. Of course, the empty box wouldn't be there. I'm a millennial - however drunk, I would never forget to recycle.\n\nI checked the recycling. No box. There was only one thing for it, call 111.\n\nOperator:\"Hello 111, what's your problem today?\"\n\nMe:\"I think I might have taken a paracetamol overdose.\"\n\nOperator:\"How many tablets have you taken in the last 24 hours?\"\n\nMe:\"I only really remember taking two, but I was drunk, and I've just got this feeling that I've taken an overdose.\"\n\nOperator:\"But you can only remember taking two tablets? You've just got a feeling you might have had more?\"\n\nMe:\"Yes and I feel sick, and tired and awful.\"\n\nOperator:\"I think you've just got a hangover, love.\"\n\nSo that was the official opinion. I was going to live. I could get on with my day. \n\nLater, on the train to Birmingham with my sister, along came another thought - me lying on a hospital bed covered in tubes.\n\nWords on a black screen flashed into my mind and taunted me:\"If only you had listened. You could have prevented this. You could have gone to hospital and had your stomach pumped\". \n\nAs the train pulled into Birmingham I came up with a plan. I told my sister I had some bits to buy for university and I'd meet her later.  \n\nI sprinted to catch the train heading for the station nearest Queen Elizabeth Hospital. I had at least a couple of hours before liver damage set in.\n\nI was sweating as the train pulled into the station. I hurried up the escalators, pushed through the gates and ran across the road. I paused for a second outside A&E and, as my breathing slowed, I acknowledged that even though I knew where I was, I was lost in a world of menacing thoughts. \n\nI replayed the moments before I went to bed the night before, this time slowly and carefully. I had walked through the door, gone into the kitchen and taken two paracetamol tablets. Then I put the box back in the cupboard and went to bed.\n\nMy OCD screeched:\"What are you doing? What about the other memories?\"\n\nBut when I tried to recall the 24 tablets, the recycling, the hospital bed, I couldn't find them. They just morphed into other terrible fears and'what ifs'?\n\nI heard my own voice, underneath the chatter:\"Turn around and walk away.\"\n\nIn front of me people with broken legs and raging fevers hobbled into A&E, but I turned back towards the train station and my sister. \n\nI had found my way.\n\nFrom Storytelling Live 2018, you may also like to read:\n\nFor more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the podcast.\nTL;DR: Life as a disabled person can sometimes be quite different and difficult.

Our gratitude to you will be eternal.\"\n\nHe later added in a statement that he had marked the occasion with staff from St Thomas' Hospital, who cared for him when he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus in April.\n\nA World War Two Spitfire plane with the words\"Thank U NHS\"painted on its underside tipped its wings above hospitals and the homes of fundraisers and volunteers, recognising the way people have supported the NHS and local communities during the pandemic.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the celebrations were\"very personal for me\"as his late mother was a nurse and later relied on the health service when she became ill.\n\nHe said:\"Many, many times she got gravely ill and it was the NHS that she turned to, and I remember as a boy, a teenager, being in high dependency units, in intensive care units, with my mum, watching nurses and other support staff keep my mum alive.\n\n\"They did that on more than one occasion - it's etched in my memory.

They were doing that every day.\"\n\nThe National Health Service was launched on 5 July 1948, with the core principle that it is free at the point of delivery and is based on clinical need.\n\nAs part of a weekend of anniversary events, UK landmarks were lit up blue in celebration and remembrance on Saturday.\n\nDowning Street, the Royal Albert Hall, Blackpool Tower, the Shard and the Wembley Arch were all illuminated and a minute's silence was held to remember those who have died during the pandemic.\n\nThe latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220.\n\nPeople were also asked to place lights in their windows in a show of remembrance on Saturday night, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, lighting a candle in Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon was among officials joining in with the nationwide applause on Sunday evening.\n\nIn a video message she said the country was\"depending more than ever\"on its health and care workers, and thanked them\"from the bottom of my heart\". \n\nFirst Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said NHS staff and social care workers were\"all heroes\".\n\nAnd Captain Tom Moore - who raised more than \u00a332m for the health service by walking laps of his garden during lockdown - shared a video of himself clapping from his armchair at home in Bedfordshire.\n\nThe idea for Sunday's round of applause was inspired by the success of the weekly Clap for Carers, which saw households across the country show their appreciation for the NHS and other key workers during the lockdown.\n\nAnnemarie Plas, who founded the Clap for Carers initiative, joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside No 10 for the clap at 17:00 BST.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast on Sunday morning, she said:\"We have had this first part of the crisis, we don't know what lies ahead, so if we can have this one moment where we say thank you to each other and recharge our batteries for what may be a heavier time that lies ahead, then I think that is a beautiful moment.\"\n\nShe said the NHS helped her when she arrived in the UK from the Netherlands as a new mother,\"so I feel very happy to be in touch with the NHS this way\".\n\nMs Plas added that the celebrations were\"not just about the NHS\"but about others who have also\"sacrificed so much\"during the pandemic - such as\"delivery workers, teachers, parents, good neighbours\".\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge praised healthcare workers on a visit to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk.\n\nThe couple chatted to staff and volunteers about how they coped during the first wave of the epidemic. \n\nThe Prince of Wales paid tribute to staff working through\"the most testing time in the service's history\".\n\nIn a video message to mark the occasion, Prince Charles spoke of his gratitude and pride for the\"costly sacrifices\"of NHS staff.\n\n\"Despite all that has been endured, there is deep cause for gratitude, and a true reason for pride,\"he said.\n\nThe prince also said the pandemic had brought out the best in people, adding:\"This renewal of our community spirit has been a silver lining during this dark time.\"\n\nSpeaking at a rally celebrating seven decades of the health service, Labour leader Sir Keir said NHS staff needed a pay rise in the wake of the pandemic. \n\n\"It's very important that we don't just say thanks, but recognise in a meaningful way what the NHS has done,\"he said.\n\nHis comments come after unions representing more than 1.3 million nurses, cleaners, physiotherapists, healthcare assistants, dieticians, radiographers, porters, midwives, paramedics and other NHS employees wrote to the chancellor and the prime minister calling for pay talks to start soon.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 protesters gathered at Marble Arch in London, calling for the end of racial disparity in the health system.\n\nOne of the organisers, Tyrek Morris, 21, told the crowd:\"We are protesting for black lives and one of the demands we have is to abolish the racial disparity within the NHS, especially towards black women.\n\n\"We need to implement extensive measures to prevent the disproportionate suffering of black women in healthcare and bring to an end the significantly increased black maternal mortality rate.\"\n\nHow are you marking the anniversary of the NHS?

I was working 60 to 70 hours a week. We were doing our best,\"he said.\n\n\"I pray to God I had never taken that job, had I known the outcome. It was very frustrating. I was not allowed to work as a chief executive. I just couldn't do my job.\"\n\nDr Das died last year without facing trial, following one of Wales' biggest inquiries into care home neglect.\n\nBoth Dr Das and Mr Black were charged as part of the \u00a311m Operation Jasmine inquiry, with Dr Das also charged with offences relating to theft and false accounting.\n\nAsked by the coroner Geraint Williams why he did not resign, Mr Black said:\"I had nowhere else to go, I had a mortgage. I had two boys at primary school.\n\n\"Morally, I just felt duty bound to try and improve the situation. There was a great deal of emotion involved. You had to try and help them. Not Dr Das - the staff and the residents.\"\n\nMr Black had previously told the inquest that his primary focus in the early stages of his employment with Puretruce in 2003 were the financial problems at the company.\n\nBut the inquest heard about meetings and written correspondence from the end of 2003 between Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales - now Care Inspectorate Wales - along with social services and the management team at Brithdir, discussing areas of concern, which included Mr Black.\n\nCoroner Mr Williams asked him to respond to previous evidence outlining a lack of care plans for residents, as well as a lack of adequate training for staff.  \n\n\"I didn't know how severe it was,\"said Mr Black.\n\n\"My focus was on the financial side. I didn't get involved in care plans.\"\n\n\"But it was your function to know what your staff were doing,\"replied the coroner.\n\nMr Black said:\"I couldn't get involved in medical matters. I wouldn't know how to read a care plan if my life depended on it. I wouldn't know how to help.\"\n\nThe former chief executive was also asked why he appeared to defend Dr Das in a letter to Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales dated September 2004, even though he admitted realising his boss was\"deceptive\"and\"aggressive\"shortly after he started working for Puretruce.\n\n\"When I first joined the company I would defend Dr Das, he was my employer, he was a professional doctor,\"said Mr Black.  \n\n\"The further I got into working with the company, the more I understood a side of Dr Das I hadn't realised. He wasn't the man I thought he was. He was getting progressively worse - his aggression was getting worse.\"\n\nMr Black rejected the suggestion he kept working for Dr Das for the money, saying:\"he never paid me that much.\"\n\nResponding to questions from Ben Summers, barrister for the families of three of the former residents, Mr Black said he thought it was Dr Das's fault he was giving evidence at an inquest into seven deaths and that he counted himself as\"one of his victims\".\n\nThe inquest is looking into the deaths of Stanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, Evelyn Jones, 87, and William Hickman, 71.\n\nA hearing into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held following the conclusion of the other six.\n\nThe hearings are expected to last until the middle of this month.\nTL;DR: Staff were becoming ill trying to resolve constant problems at a care home where alleged neglect took place in the early-2000s, the former chief executive has told an inquest.\n\nArticle: By Rebecca JonesArts correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe comedian made his name alongside Matt Lucas in the BBC sketch show Little Britain and is a judge on Britain's Got Talent. \n\nBut he has achieved phenomenal success with his nine novels, including The Boy in the Dress and Gangsta Granny.\n\n\"I should really give up comedy and just concentrate on children's books because it is so rewarding,\"he said.\n\nWalliams's books have sold more than 14 million copies around the world and been translated into almost 50 languages.\n\nNonetheless, he admitted he felt under pressure venturing into the world of literature.\n\n\"It's actually rather a big responsibility that children are picking up your books,\"he told the BBC.\n\n\"They have got to be good.

Walliams said the pair were still in touch and had not fallen out.

Sanctions will be re-imposed in two stages in August and November. \n\nWhy are the Europeans trying to keep the deal alive?  \n\nUnder the agreement Iran undertook to curb nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. \n\nThe deal, negotiated by the US, three European Union powers, Russia and China, was designed to prevent Iran developing atomic weapons - something it has always denied trying to do.\n\nThe agreement is still seen by the non-US signatories as the best way of preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power, though they concede it is not perfect.\n\nThe Europeans also stand to lose billions of dollars of business when US sanctions return. \n\nA deal by the European plane-manufacturer, Airbus, to sell nearly 100 planes to Iran is now in danger. Some parts used in the planes are made in the US.\n\nBig French firms such as energy giant Total and car-makers Renault and Peugeot also have investments in Iran.\n\nBoth France and Germany have seen a sharp rise in exports to Iran since sanctions were lifted in 2016. \n\nHow are the Europeans trying to rescue the agreement?\n\nFrance has condemned the re-imposition of sanctions as\"unacceptable\".

The bank will also review less-profitable areas of business.\n\n'Why now?'\n\nAt its peak, the bank employed more than 300,000 people, but since the global financial crisis around 2008, HSBC has sold businesses and left some countries, including Brazil in 2016.\n\nVarious chief executives have aimed to make HSBC a simpler business, especially after the bank agreed to pay $1.9bn to regulators in 2012 over poor money laundering controls.\n\nTrade union Unite said the news would cause apprehension with many lockdown measures still in place.\n\n\"The question that must be asked today is why now HSBC?\"Dominic Hook, Unite national officer said.\"At present vast numbers of HSBC staff are making massive sacrifices working from home or taking risks travelling into offices and bank branches to help customers.\"\n\n\"Unite will continue to oppose any compulsory job losses within HSBC and work vigorously to ensure staff are heard and their jobs protected,\"he said.\n\nThe bank also faces political challenges.

They just handled it really badly, it doesn't seem like there was a real apology,\"she added.\n\nJenn Harrison, her husband and two children travelled from Leigh to the Arndale Centre in Manchester. \n\nShe said they were repeatedly told to go away and come back when the line had reduced by security and Build-A-Bear staff.\n\n\"The parents from the back of the queue offered to use our own money to buy a raffle book so we could take a number and go get a coffee or something and come back when it was less busy but they said they can't do that,\"she added.\n\n\"They've given the voucher to everyone, so people that queued up and got the bear could now get the voucher too, so it doesn't feel like we really got anything.\n\n\"I don't think I would go back, we went as it was a special experience for the kids.\"\n\nIn a statement, Build-a-Bear Workshop said the response to the event had been\"overwhelming\".\n\nIt added:\"We feel it is important to share that, based on the information available to us before the day began, we could not have predicted this reaction to our pay your age day event.\"\nTL;DR: Parents have said they will no longer shop at Build-A-Bear Workshop, after its cheap teddy offer caused queues of up to eight hours.\n\nArticle: But despite adopting the traffic-light system used in England, ministers are advising people not to go abroad.\n\nThe first minister warned it was\"best avoided\"because of concerns travellers could bring Covid with them.\n\nMeanwhile, he revealed he had planned to go further in easing Covid rules but paused because of the Indian variant.\n\nPlans to allow pubs to trade indoors, and for cinemas and museums to reopen, will go ahead from Monday. \n\nMinisters had considered relaxing lockdown restrictions further on the same, but Mark Drakeford said officials had\"decided to hold back\"for more advice.\n\nHe told the BBC he had been considering allowing\"some small events\"and\"greater mixing between people not in a household\".\n\nBoth are now on hold.\n\nEleven cases'of concern'\n\nExperts are concerned the variant has mutations that may make it more transmissible, but it is not yet known if it causes more severe disease or if it might make current vaccines less effective.\n\nA total of 26 cases of two variants first identified in India had been found in Wales as of last Thursday - including 11 of a type identified by officials as a\"variant of concern\".\n\nA total of 1,313 cases of the variant of concern have been identified in the UK.\n\nNo change to Welsh vaccine programme\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Friday evening the wait between jabs will be cut from 12 weeks to eight for the over-50s and clinically vulnerable because of concern over the Indian variant.\n\nThe change does not apply in Wales and the Welsh government said it will continue with the rollout as planned.\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson said:\"We have considered the latest evidence and advice from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation].\n\n\"Given the low numbers of the Indian variant and the high numbers of people in Wales already vaccinated, we are confident that our vaccination programme already has the flexibility it needs to respond swiftly and effectively and are not making any changes at this stage.\"\n\nNew rules on international travel \n\nPeople in England and Scotland can take holidays abroad in a small number of so-called\"green\"countries - including Portugal, Israel and Singapore - without having to quarantine when they return.  \n\nWales will be adopting the same\"traffic light\"system, with countries classified as green, amber and red.\n\nIt means people will be able to travel to a small number of foreign destinations in the green list without the need to quarantine on their return.\n\nMandatory quarantine for countries not on the green list remains in place, and visitors to red list countries will need to book hotels on their return.\n\nEveryone who travels will need to book at least one test on their return.\n\nHowever, the Welsh government said it would continue to advise people to only travel for essential purposes.\n\nMr Drakeford said:\"This is the year to take your holiday in Wales and foreign travel is best avoided.\"\n\nHe admitted his travel advice was not a rule because it would be\"unenforceable\". He urged caution against\"importing\"coronavirus from other parts of the world.\n\n\"We know most people who travel from Wales will be doing it from Bristol, Manchester, London, so once those airports are open and travel across the UK is allowed, then people from Wales will be able to travel,\"he said.\n\nMr Drakeford told a press conference on Friday he did not want to\"make people feel guilty\"about going abroad, but urged people to\"think of their own safety and the safety of others\", adding there were\"fantastic opportunities\"to take a holiday in Wales instead.\n\nWill there be a vaccine passport?\n\nFrom 24 May, a\"paper-based vaccination status\"will be available for people in Wales who have had two doses of vaccination and need to urgently travel to a country that requires Covid vaccination proof. \n\nA UK government app that will act as a vaccine passport is due to be available in England on Monday, but the first minister said there was likely to be a four-week gap before it could be used in Wales due to technical reasons.\n\nWhat Covid rules are changing on Monday?\n\nMr Drakeford told the press conference Wales would move to Covid alert level two from Monday, meaning:  \n\nFrom 24 May, restrictions on numbers of visitors to care homes will be eased.\n\nMr Drakeford said that, if the situation remained positive at the start of June, he would look at whether Wales could move to alert level one.\n\nBut he warned he may need to delay that because of the Indian variant.\n\nThis move would include\"looking at relaxing the rules further around people meeting in their own homes, increasing the number of people able to attend wedding receptions and restarting larger events\".\n\nHow have businesses reacted?\n\nEllen Morris, the owner of two pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, welcomed the relaxation of the rules but said it would be difficult to police rules which dictate only six people from six different household can meet.\n\n\"They are grown adults - they should be able to decide, it shouldn't be me telling them you can do this,\"she told BBC Radio Wales.\n\n\"They call it hospitality - I don't feel I'm being very hospitable these days. We are talking about people's mental health here. It's been a long enough year without being left out of groups.\"\n\nMr Drakeford said social distancing rules in hospitality venues could be lifted if transmissions continued to fall.\n\nDJ Stacey Alford, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, has been receiving support from the UK government's freelancers' fund and Universal Credit.\n\nShe said she had been\"extremely cautious\"and followed the rules very closely, but was frustrated by stricter rules in Wales than in England.\n\n\"My bugbear is we can't even do things like background noise, so those opportunities are gone, but DJs in England are able to do that.\"\n\nThe relaxation will also mean indoor play centres can open, and indoor wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people can take place.\n\nGail Windley, a wedding planner from Swansea, welcomed the news but said it would still mean weddings would be too small for most couples, and criticised a lack of clarity about further easing.\n\nCharmaine Heydenrych, who owns a soft play centre in Cardiff, said she was\"ready\"to open but said being limited to 30 people was\"not sustainable\".\n\nWhat have opposition politicians said?\n\nWelsh Conservative Russell George welcomed the move to level two but said the Welsh government\"should have outlined a roadmap to give hope to businesses and communities\". \n\n\"It is concerning that the Welsh Government has indicated that social distancing and mask wearing will be required into the Autumn. \n\n\"What people really want is for the Welsh and UK governments to work together, to end the confusion over different restrictions in the two countries, especially as the virus does not recognise borders.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price welcomed the first minister's call for people to holiday in Wales rather than go aboard.\n\n\"It's a positive message - we need it for the economy as well. It's not just about greater health protection but also supporting tourism and hospitality businesses which have had a torrid time\".\n\nMr Price said the sector still needed further financial support:\"What is the plan for the months ahead for hospitality?\". \n\nIs the Indian variant in Wales because of travel?\n\nThe 26 cases of two variants first fouind in India are\"almost entirely the result of international travel\", the first minister said.\n\nMr Drakeford said those infected were\"people coming back to Wales from overseas\"and all cases were being carefully monitored by local public health teams.\n\n\"All the information I have had is that the individuals involved are following all the advice that they are required to follow, self-isolating and so on,\"he said.\n\n\"And the advice I have is not that we need to be overly concerned about the position in Wales at the moment.\"\n\nDr Gill Richardson, deputy chief medical officer for vaccines in Wales, told BBC Wales\"we're not led to believe that it will evade the vaccine at this point\".\n\nPublic Health Wales told BBC Wales it was not identifying where the 11 variant of concern cases were\"due to the risk of small number identification\".\n\nDr Robin Howe, incident director for Public Health Wales, said the majority of cases were associated with travel or with known contact, with the remainder still under investigation.\nTL;DR: People in Wales will be able to travel to a small list of countries from Monday without going into quarantine when they get back.\n\nArticle: The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it acted over emergency care, including paediatrics, following an inspection of two acute sites run by Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust (SaTH).\n\nThe watchdog says it will issue a report on its latest findings soon.\n\nSaTH says it is facing\"huge\"emergency demand. \n\nWhile the CQC said it was unable to share detail of its latest concerns about Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal, a SaTH spokesperson said the watchdog's main issue was over children leaving emergency departments without treatment.\n\nThe beleaguered trust was put in special measures in November, meaning inspectors no longer trusted it to run itself alone.\n\nWhen that happened, it was already reporting weekly to the CQC over standards in the hospitals' maternity and emergency care.\n\nSaTH is also being investigated over baby deaths, with the scope of a review widened to include the concerns of 250 families.\n\nOn Thursday, it was fined \u00a316,000 over failures surrounding the discovery of asbestos at the Shrewsbury site.\n\nInspectors visited the hospitals last month.\n\nA CQC spokesperson said:\"As a result we took further urgent action with regard to emergency department care, including paediatrics. \n\n\"We are unable to give further details at this time but will report on our findings shortly.\"\n\nThe CQC added the trust was being\"monitored closely\", with NHS Improvement and NHS England also involved.\n\nSaTH medical director Dr Edwin Borman said:\"We were not able to see all of our patients in 15 minutes, in line with national performance targets, and some of our patients left before we could start treatment.\n\n\"We have alerted our GP colleagues of any children who left our [emergency departments] before treatment, which was the main area of concern for the CQC.\"\n\nNigel Lee, SaTH's chief operating officer, said:\"In Shropshire throughout April we have seen huge increases in emergency demand with over 20% more attendances and 30% more ambulances at our emergency departments.\n\n\"Our staff are working incredibly hard to manage this demand while we await our new recruits who will start with us in June.\"\n\nIn April, 17 new doctors were recruited. Insufficient staffing formed part of inspectors' safety concerns.\nTL;DR: \"Further urgent action\" has been taken against a hospital trust already in special measures amid safety concerns over emergency and maternity services.\n\nArticle: The stocktake of animals at Africa Alive, near Lowestoft, and Banham Zoo started on 1 January and takes about four days to complete.\n\nHayley Parker, head keeper at Africa Alive, said cockroach counting was not one of the better jobs.\n\n\"Most people will do it but it's not necessarily a favourite job for people,\"she said.\n\nBoth zoos are run by the Zoological Society of East Anglia (ZSEA), a charitable trust formed last year.\n\nThe stocktake is performed annually and the results are fed into a database which can be viewed by other zoos around the world.\n\n\"Anyone can see them to check what we're holding, and they can see if they want any of our species,\"Ms Parker said.\n\nBird issues\n\nBanham Zoo's count will show a change in the number of Grevy's zebra.\n\nOne of the zoo's females died last March, but two more were imported in December.\n\n\"Animals are never traded for money,\"said Mike Woolham, animal manager at Banham Zoo.\n\n\"All I have to do is pay for the transport.\"\n\nThe cost of importing two Grevy's zebras from Germany, boosting the total stock at Banham to four, cost about 3,000 euro (\u00a32,500).\n\nMr Woolham said zebras and tigers were some of the easiest to count of the zoos' 64 species which are part of managed breeding programmes.\n\nBirds pose more of a problem.\n\n\"The nesting boxes can make it difficult to count them,\"Mr Woolham said.\n\n\"Feeding time is a great way to get the birds out.\"\nTL;DR: More than 1,500 cockroaches and two new zebras are among the animals being counted at zoos in Suffolk and Norfolk.\n\nArticle: By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent\n\nDaphne Koller, president of Coursera, said the necessary technology was available but universities had been hesitant about their\"reputation\".\n\nSo far, online courses have mostly offered certificates for short courses rather than full degrees.\n\nProf Koller says online degrees can be\"more affordable and accessible\".\n\nFounded in California four years ago, Coursera has become one of the world's biggest providers of\"massive, open, online courses\"- known as Moocs.\n\nThe online platform has 20 million students following courses from about 145 prestigious universities and institutions around the world.\n\nBut most of the online courses have been short units that give students a certificate, rather than a full degree or credits towards a degree.\n\nProf Koller, speaking at an educational technology conference in London, said the next stage for online learning would be leading universities offering mainstream undergraduate courses online, with invigilated exams and full degrees.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that will happen - and it will be a lot earlier than 10 years. The societal need is there.\n\n\"A full-blown undergraduate degree - I'd be surprised if that didn't happen within five years.\n\n\"Will it be fully online? Or will it have some residential components? That remains to be seen.\"\n\nProf Koller said the technology had kept improving, but universities had been held back by the\"protection of the brand\"and not wanting to be seen to move away from personal tuition.\n\n\"It's the perception we need to break, it's not the technology that's been the barrier,\"she said.\n\nIn terms of supervising exams for distance learners, she said that webcams are\"surprisingly hard to beat\".\n\nProf Koller said concerns about impersonal online learning were often built on an unrealistic image of traditional campus-based teaching - and that most students are not\"walking on lawns next to ivy-clad buildings\".\n\n\"It's a false comparison to think it's either anonymous online teaching or else a cosy armchair and individual tutors.\n\n\"When you have a lecture hall with 300 people, you're not getting personal interaction.\"\n\nOnline learning should not be compared\"with some utopian ideal of 10 people sitting around in a seminar room engaging deeply with an instructor\". \n\nProf Koller says that online learning is going to become the route for students who want to improve their qualifications but who cannot afford the time or money to study for a campus-based degree.\n\n\"Many working adults have obligations, they have a job, a family, a mortgage, they can't go back to school.\"\n\nIn countries such as India, with ambitious targets to expand higher education, Prof Koller says the authorities will have to use online universities, because there is insufficient capacity in bricks-and-mortar institutions.\n\nThere are also efforts to use online learning to teach refugees, such as those displaced by Syria's civil war.\n\nCoursera has announced a partnership with the US State Department to help refugees to access online courses to improve their job chances, such as English language lessons or computer coding.\n\nIt would remove any costs from studying, such as fees for certificates showing the completion of courses.\n\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\n\nCoursera was founded four years ago, part of a wave of online university projects that were claimed to be about to revolutionise higher education, making it cheaper and more accessible to students around the world.\n\nMany millions signed up for free short courses - but Prof Koller is predicting another stage with online learning being incorporated into formal fee-charging degree courses from mainstream universities.\n\nThere are already many online degrees offered - but Prof Koller says that in the past, such distance learning was seen as something\"respectable universities do not engage in\".\n\nThere are signs that this change is already beginning to happen.\n\nThe UK's online university platform, Futurelearn, has announced a project with the University of Leeds, in which course units studied online will count as credits towards an undergraduate degree.\n\nStudents from this autumn will be able to take course units online and cut the cost of tuition fees for a geography degree.\n\nPeter Horrocks, chairman of Futurelearn, described this as a\"breakthrough moment\".\n\nFuturelearn has been created by the Open University, a longstanding provider of degrees by distance learning.\n\nBut the big change will be if leading, campus-based universities begin to compete for mainstream, undergraduate courses online.\n\nAnother major US online university network, edX, is launching a project this autumn allowing online course units to be used as building blocks towards a full degree.\n\nEdX is offering a range of online courses from Arizona State University - and if a student passes eight of these, costing $200 (\u00a3150) each, it counts as the equivalent of a first year at university.\n\nCoursera has launched two online postgraduate courses with the University of Illinois, at a much lower price than their conventional counterparts.\n\nProf Koller says the past four years has seen a rapid rise in the numbers of students wanting to study online, but a slower reaction from universities in offering fully fledged online courses.\n\n\"We thought that the change in academic institutions would be more rapid,\"she said.\"Universities are not the most nimble of organisations.\"\n\nThat change could now be approaching, she says, with universities working out their strategies for a potentially huge market.\n\nThe hype around Moocs might have faded, but the big impact could be about to begin.\nTL;DR: Leading universities will offer fully accredited undergraduate courses online within five years, says the co-founder of a US online university network.\n\nArticle: Chris CookPolicy editor, Newsnight\n\nThat is a notion raised by Daniel Finkelstein in The Times today. This idea - which has fans in Westminster and Whitehall - strikes me as a misreading of the situation in Europe.\n\nThis idea has arisen because Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, is a game theorist, a type of economist who studies interactions in simplified versions of reality. \n\nThese stylised scenarios are known, in the jargon, as\"games\". Famous ones you might have heard of include\"the Stag Hunt\",\"The Ultimatum Game\"and - most famously -\"the Prisoner's Dilemma\". \n\nOne famous game is called\"Chicken\". Imagine two cars racing towards one another. If neither swerves, both drivers lose. If either swerves, however, that person is deemed to lose. \n\nThis is a bit like the Greek negotiation. Neither side wants to give in first, but neither side wants to end with no deal. \n\nThis is a hard game to be good at - unless you can send a worrying signal to the driver of the other car. \n\nYou could try to convince the other driver that you have no control of the car, so they will be forced to move. \n\nInside options and outside options\n\nRip off the steering wheel and wave it out of the window, perhaps? Or you could behave like you enjoy crashes - or are indifferent to the pain they cause. That, Lord Finkelstein has suggested, was part of the Greek negotiating strategy.\n\n Lord Finkelstein wrote:\"Varoufakis believed that if his negotiating partners - the Germans, the IMF, the Commission - concluded he was a bit bonkers, a bit reckless, they would appreciate that he might crash the Greek economy and bring down the whole edifice of the euro on top of him. Persuading your adversary that you are mad is a classic game theory gambit.\"\n\nI think you can understand the Greek position much more simply: they predicated their negotiating position on notions that turned out to be untrue. \n\nHere is another simple idea from game theory: a classic negotiation between two parties is best understood by looking at ideas called the\"outside option\"and the\"inside option\". \n\nThe outside option is the outcome for each individual if the negotiation fails. The inside option is what you get if the negotiation is completed. Negotiation is usually the process of changing the value of the inside option.\n\nIf you are trying to buy a car from a salesperson, then the outside option is walking away - keep your cash, take no car and retain the option of starting a negotiation with other salespeople. \n\nFor the seller, the outside option means keeping the car, having less cash and retaining the option of selling that car to someone else. \n\nFair and free negotiations will usually fail unless the inside option is better than the outside option. \n\nGreek assumptions\n\nIf it is better not to agree for any party, they won't. My assumption (largely based on Duncan's great reporting) is that Mr Varoufakis, a few months ago, thought that the outside option for Europe was gruesome. \n\nSo he could demand a lot, and they would still agree because it would be better for them.\n\nFor example, we know that he estimated that a messy Greek default would lead to financial contagion: for the sake of not saving little Greece, Europe could make investors worry about lending to Portugal, Spain or Italy. \n\nHe wrote in 2012\"the notion that Europe is ready for a Grexit is absurd.\"\n\nMeasures then under way by the ECB could not limit\"the damage on Spain, then Italy etc.\"\n\nIn short, if Europe did not cut a deal, Greece would rip Europe in two. That would make the outside option for Europe a catastrophe. \n\nAnd Mr Varoufakis also assumed that the outside option for Greece was not all that bad. That means his hand, in a negotiation, would be very strong.\n\nThat is because, quite recently, Greece was running a so-called\"primary surplus\"earlier this year. \n\nThat means if it got cut off from financial markets because it failed to pay its debtors, it could still keep its public services running. \n\nI would presume he also thought the banks would be kept afloat by the European Central Bank: in previous chapters of the crisis, it actually rewrote its own rules to keep the banks open and liquid in Greece. \n\nIn that situation, Mr Varoufakis thought the damage of a failure to agree would be much worse to Europe than it would be to Greece.\n\nAnd, in that situation, the best strategy for Greece is to wait. This isn't a\"madman\"strategy. It's a quite rational calculation about the outside option. \n\nSo he wanted to wait for investors to start fretting and fussing, for bond yields to rise, for bank shares to start shedding value and for a credit squeeze to start moving through Europe.  \n\nIf contagion ever made it look like Spain or - heaven forbid - the vast Italian debt could not be serviced, the Eurogroup would race to offer a deal to Greece on good terms. \n\nThere was a catch, though. All of his assumptions were wrong.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nFirst, investors have been very unconcerned by Greek default. They see the politics and arithmetic of Greece as different to the rest of the continent and do not see parallels between them. \n\nSo the market panics never came. The Eurogroup could afford to wait.\n\nSecond, Greece nosedived into recession. It is surely not now running a primary surplus. \n\nThat means that Greece needs help just to run the existing level of public services. That means pain to Greece for not being able to access new financing. It cannot wait.\n\nThird, the ECB did not keep Greece's banks going, which means the economy is being suffocated. \n\nEvery day that this runs on makes the situation worse, businesses being shut down and individuals suffering. This whole scenario is dismal for the Greeks - and worsens every day.\n\nIn short, the outside option turns out, in the past few weeks, to have been much worse for Greece and a lot less damaging to the rest of Europe than they thought. \n\nSo the inside option they thought they might be able to extract from the rest of Europe turns out to be much worse than they once imagined. \n\nThat all strikes me as a simpler explanation of the Syriza strategy than a\"madman at the wheel\"gambit. \n\nIndeed, put this argument another way: if you were to pursue that strategy, would you do it like this? \n\nIf I were pursuing that approach, I would start openly preparing for a messy default and exit from the Eurozone. \n\nThis is not to say that I think Syriza solely misjudged the economics. \n\nNatural allies in Rome and Paris were alienated. Syriza misunderstood what role the US State Department would play. \n\nThey made it politically difficult for German and Dutch politicians to help them. \n\nThey also behaved, at times, as though the governments who lend them money do not have their own democratic mandates.\n\nBut I think a misreading the outside option for the rest of Europe is a major part of what went wrong - not a failed plea of insanity.\nTL;DR: Was the Greek negotiating strategy with the Eurogroup designed to convince the rest of Europe that the Syriza government was mad?\n\nArticle: Cumbria County Council is focusing on attracting people for 10 roles working with vulnerable children. \n\nIt said it had recruited 14 new social workers recently but none of them would be based in west Cumbria and believed the remote location was a key issue.\n\nStaff would need to remain for more than three years to keep the bonuses.\n\nCouncil assistant director of children's services Lynn Burns said:\"I don't think there's anything wrong with west Cumbria, it's a wonderful place to live. \n\n\"The difficulty is that it's remote geographically from other parts of the North West and that's sometimes what puts people off moving there.\"\n\nSense of pride\n\nShe said that despite the council facing budget pressures - it needs to save \u00a324m over the next year - one of its priorities was to protect vulnerable children and so it could justify paying the bonuses.\n\nLast year, Cumbria was one of 20 councils where the standard of child protection services was judged\"inadequate\"by Ofsted.\n\nOther organisations, including North Cumbria Hospitals Trust, have spoken in the past about the challenges of recruitment because of the\"remote location\".\n\nCumbria Tourism chairman Eric Robson said they had been working to generate a sense of pride in the area.\n\nHe said:\"Places are brands, all brands have to reinvigorated.

outstanding British film, original music, cinematography, sound and special visual effects with Alfonso Cuaron winning for director - was an impressive haul.\n\nIt's also notable for being the first 3D film to win one of the major Bafta film categories (both Avatar and Life of Pi were beaten to the prize in previous years). \n\nThe space thriller, which stars US actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, has sparked controversy over its classification as a British film. \n\nIt was developed and shot in the UK, with a British producer - David Heyman - and with ground-breaking visual effects by a UK-based team. \n\nInterestingly, Mexican director Cuaron queried during a backstage interview the whole concept of a best British film category. \n\n\"It should be best film and best non-British film,\"he said to sounds of surprise from the assembled journalists. \n\nThe biggest prize of the night went to harrowing historical drama 12 Years a Slave, which won best film and the leading actor prize for Chiwetel Ejiofor.\n\nHowever, the sweep of the major categories that some had predicted failed to materialise.\n\nOn stage, director Steve McQueen reminded the ceremony's audience that slavery was not a thing of the past.\n\n\"There are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here,\"he said.\"I just hope 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another filmmaker to make this film.\"\n\nHolding his Bafta mask backstage, McQueen recalled how he had watched the Baftas on TV as a child and travelled past Ealing Film Studios on his way to school. \n\n\"To have this in my hands... it means a hell of a lot,\"he said. \n\nBrad Pitt, who both produced and starred in the film, said:\"It's a story that says we're all the same and that freedom and our dignity is everything and that's what we must fight for.\"\n\nEarlier, Pitt and Angelina Jolie had prompted the loudest screams of the night from hundreds of fans as they walked the red carpet.\n\nThe biggest surprises of the night came in the supporting acting categories.\n\nSomali-born Barkhad Abdi beat off competition from 12 Years' Michael Fassbender (the bookies' favourite) to win best supporting actor for his impressive movie debut in Captain Phillips. \n\nJennifer Lawrence's victory as best supporting actress for her memorable turn in American Hustle toppled the hopes of favourite Lupita Nyong'o, from 12 Years a Slave. \n\nLawrence gave David O Russell's film one of its three awards of the night, along with original screenplay and make-up and hair.\n\nRussell later praised Lawrence as\"fearless\".\n\nHe said:\"From one angle she's like a regular girl from Kentucky, and from another she's like the most magical, beautiful creature you've ever seen.\" \n\nThe American director wasn't the only one being poetic on Sunday night. \n\nDame Helen Mirren, who was honoured with a Bafta fellowship presented by the Duke of Cambridge, quoted Prospero's speech from Shakespeare's The Tempest:\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep.\"\n\nShe added:\"My little life is rounded with this honour, thank you very much indeed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, director Peter Greenaway, recognised for his outstanding contribution to British cinema for films such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, recalled how at the age of 13 he had wanted to be a painter.\n\n\"In a curious way my ambition has failed,\"he admitted backstage.\"I've ended up a filmmaker instead. It's been enjoyable, a pleasant way to pass a life and career.\"\n\nHe added:\"I always think that cinema was not invented by Lumiere or Melies but was invented in the early 17th Century by four painters:  Velazquez, Caravaggio, Rubens and  Rembrandt - and I would have loved to have been of their company.\"\n\nOscar watch \n\nSo what do the Bafta results mean for the Academy Awards on 2 March? \n\nFor the past five years the best film winner chosen by British Academy voters has gone on to win an Oscar. Last year it was Argo, and before that The Artist, The King's Speech, The Hurt Locker and Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nBut the Baftas are international awards with a distinctly local flavour, and it's estimated that only about 20% of the US Academy is made up of Brits. \n\nChiwetel Ejiofor and Barkhad Abdi may have won in London but they did not have to face competition from Oscar favourites Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto - from Dallas Buyers Club - both of whom were ignored in the Bafta nominations. \n\nAnd it will be interesting to see if Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope are able to replicate their Bafta win for their adapted screenplay for the film Philomena away from a home crowd. \n\nAsked what he thought about his Oscar chances, Steve McQueen said:\"It's about the celebrating the film rather than the competition.\"\n\nRoll on 2 March.\nTL;DR: This year's Baftas may not have had any big shocks, but there were enough surprises to make the Oscar ceremony in two weeks' time look like it might have a few twists in store.\n\nArticle: By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter\n\nBut do you know which DJ inspired the lyrics to I Am The Walrus? Or why Radio 1's first weather forecast prompted 12 complaints?\n\nHere are 50 facts to celebrate the stations' first 50 years. \n\n1. The first voice on Radio 1 was Tony Blackburn, right? Wrong. Shortly after 5:30am on 30 September, broadcaster Paul Hollingdale was at the helm, with his Breakfast Special show broadcast simultaneously on both stations. \n\n2. The opening announcement was not what you'd call dynamic...\n\n3. The two stations split at 7:00am. After a five-second countdown, Tony Blackburn officially launched Radio 1 with a jingle promising\"too much fun\"and the sound of a barking dog.\n\n4. The first song played on Radio 1 was Flowers In The Rain by The Move. Over on Radio 2, it was Julie Andrews singing The Sound Of Music.\n\n5. George Martin's Theme One, however, was technically the first piece of music on Radio 1. Blackburn also played Johnny Dankworth's Beefeaters under his opening link.\n\n6. Blackburn later revealed that the famous film footage of the launch was recorded the night before, and he had to write down the words, so he could replicate them when the station went live.\n\n7. Many of Radio 1's presenters were drawn from the ranks of pirate radio - but they found the BBC a lot more strait-laced.\"I was yelled at when a 10-second link lasted 11 seconds,\"recalled Keith Skues.\"'You cannot just ignore Greenwich Mean Time, Skues!'\"\n\n8. Weather presenter Rosie O'Day received 12 complaints in the opening weeks of Radio 1 and 2. Why? Because she had the audacity to be a woman.\"Please, please spare us from Rosie O'Day reading the weather forecast,\"complained one.\"It sounds more like a children's fairy story. I'm sure she is a charming girl, but let us stick to a man for the weather news!\"\n\n9. Radio 2's Ken Bruce has a licence to drive Routemaster double-decker buses, and owns six of them, which he hires out for weddings and funerals.\n\n100 Voices that made the BBC \n\nSir Terry Wogan named top BBC radio DJ\n\n10. Before his Radio 1 debut, Dave Lee Travis stole the microphone he'd used on Radio Caroline.\"The very first pirate broadcasts were made on it, and I thought,'I have spent so much of my time on this ship, I'm having a souvenir,'\"he said.\"I just went and got a pair of scissors and cut the cable.\"\n\n11. Radio 1 launched half a decade after The Beatles' debut single, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the music industry. Trade magazine Record Retailer accused the BBC of\"trailing years behind public taste\"and warned\"the new station must swing if it is to be effective\".\n\n12. Radio 2's own soap opera, Waggoners Walk, launched in 1969. Set in Hampstead, it was often controversial, covering story-lines like contraception and homosexuality.\n\n13. The show was cancelled at short notice in 1980. Some of the cast heard the news on the radio, and the writers responded by having aliens invade Hampstead Heath.\n\n14. Terry Wogan made his Radio 2 debut in 1967, presenting show Late Night Extra -\"on the beat with music and news [and] off the record with pop\".\n\n15. The Radio 1 Roadshow began in July 1973 with a Land Rover pulling a converted caravan around British holiday resorts. It's now morphed into the Big Weekend, with up to 100,000 fans watching acts like Jay-Z, Foo Fighters and Madonna playing unlikely towns like Swindon, Dundee and Norwich.\n\n16. Between 1967 and 2004, John Peel brought more than 2,000 artists into the BBC to record one of his fabled Peel Sessions. First up were psychedelic rock band Tomorrow, with the likes of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, The Smiths, Nirvana, Pulp and The White Stripes coming after.\n\n17. But it was The Fall who recorded the most Peel sessions - 32 in all.\n\n18. These days, DJs are expected to know everything about music - but no-one can be right all the time. Revealing the Radio 1 Top 40 in March 1981, Tony Blackburn announced a new entry by pop newcomers\"Duhran Duhran\". After several phone calls, he corrected the mistake, saying:\"None of us are too big to apologise.\"\n\n19. Kenny Everett recorded several interviews with The Beatles for Radio 1 and 2  - but he also helped inspire one of their lyrics after taking an acid trip with John Lennon on the Weybridge golf course (of all places). \n\n\"A couple of months after my psychedelic round of golf with John I was in the Abbey Road recording studios where the Beatles were recording I Am The Walrus,\"wrote Everett in his autobiography.\"When he got to the line about getting a tan from standing in the English rain, he stopped and said to me:'Reminds me of that day on the Weybridge golf course, eh Ken?' to which I replied:'What'?' I'm sure he thought I was a complete lemon... or was it a bird?\"\n\n20. Chris Evans has presented both the Radio 1 and Radio 2 Breakfast Shows - but he got his start in radio as Timmy Mallet's assistant on Manchester's Radio Piccadilly, playing a character called Nobby No Level, whose catchphrase was:\"What I don't know - I don't know!\"\n\n21. To celebrate its fifth birthday in 1972, Radio 1 released hundreds of balloons from the top of Broadcasting House. Attached to each balloon was a form on which the finder could write their favourite record title and return it to their favourite DJ, who would play it on air.\n\n22. In 2015, Elaine Paige helped Pieter - a regular listener to her Radio 2 show - propose to his boyfriend live on air. \n\n23. Derek Jameson, who presented Radio 2's Breakfast Show from 1986 - 1991, became a broadcaster late in life as a consequence of suing the BBC. The former newspaper editor accused Radio 4's Week Ending of libel for saying he was\"so ignorant he thought erudite was a type of glue\". He lost the case and was ordered to pay \u00a375,000 in costs - forcing him to accept a job with the corporation he had sued.\n\n24. Many songs have been\"banned\"by BBC Radio over the years - but one of the first to be censored by Radio 1 was Pink Floyd's It Would Be So Nice. A reference to the Evening Standard newspaper in the opening verse was enough to breach the BBC's strict no-advertising policy.\n\n25. DJ Mike Read got the blame for banning Relax - but he says the decision wasn't in his power.\"I didn't ban Relax,\"he said,\"the BBC banned it. I was just a BBC employee.\"Defending the decision, he added:\"The video did have that big fat Buddha bloke urinating from the balcony into somebody's mouth. Even now, that's not terribly good.\"\n\n26. Read later made up with the band and provided a voice-over on the TV advert for their debut album. \n\n27. Jimi Hendrix, Madness and The Who have all recorded jingles for Radio 1 and 2.\n\n28. On December 6, 1980 Radio 1's Andy Peebles interviewed John Lennon and Yoko Ono in New York, just two days before John was assassinated.\n\n29.  In 1976, Tony Blackburn fell to pieces on air, after his wife Tessa Wyatt, star of hit sitcom Robin's Nest, left him. With millions listening, he played Chicago's If You Leave Me Now over and over again, begging for Tessa to return. He has called this his\"one big broadcasting mistake\".\n\n30. In 1991, Radio 1 managed to persuade Whitney Houston to cover for Simon Bates while he was on holiday. \n\n31.  Nowadays, almost every show has some sort of interactive element, but Annie Nightingale's Sunday Show was Radio 1's first dedicated request show. It ran for 12 years from 1975.\n\n32. Taping songs off the radio was a rite of passage days before streaming. It was illegal, of course, but Annie used it to her advantage.\"I used to say:'In a few minutes, I'll be playing Is That All There Is by Cristina,' so it gave people a chance to set up their tape recorders,\"she laughs.\n\n33. Nigel Ogden, the host of Radio 2's big organ bonanza, The Organist Entertains, first featured on the show as a player in his teens, before taking over as a presenter in 1980.\n\n34.\"Hi there, pop pickers\".\"Quack Quack, Oops\".\"Stop!.... Carry on\".\"One Year Out\".\"It's Another True Storeeee!\"\"Not'Arf\".\n\n35. After a Christmas Party got out of hand in 1995, Chris Evans\"phoned in sick\"for the following day's Breakfast show. He was duly docked a day's pay - reportedly in the region of \u00a37,000.  The following morning, he was back on the airwaves, telling listeners:\"I feel like I've had a holiday in Bermuda - although it was more expensive than a week in Bermuda, obviously.\"\n\n36. Simon Bates' first job at the BBC was as a Radio 4 continuity announcer.\"I was very bad at it too,\"he told The Independent.\"I never mastered the art of saying'Radio 4' between the end of one programme and the start of the next. If you try it, it's really very difficult.\"\n\n37. Early DJs were hired for their skills as presenters, rather than an interest in music. John Peel, the one exception, remembered attending a party at Dave Lee Travis's house when he\"suddenly realised that DLT didn't own any records\". He asked him about it and Travis replied,\"Oh no, it's too much trouble... Anything I really like I've copied on tape. I've got quite a lot of tapes and I play them in the car, you see.\"\n\n38. Chris Moyles opened his first Radio 1 Breakfast Show in 2004 with a five-minute song crammed with clips of his predecessors. The song concluded with the prescient declaration:\"From now until they fire his ass, the saviour of Radio 1 is here\".\n\n39. Moyles clocked up eight years in the hot seat before bowing out in 2012 - making him Radio 1's longest-serving Breakfast presenter.\n\n40. Terry Wogan managed 27 years on Radio 2's Breakfast show, before bowing out in 2009. Bidding farewell, he said:\"Thank you for being my friend,\"before cueing up The Party's Over by Anthony Newley, which features the lyrics:\"Now you must wake up, all dreams must end.\"\n\n41. In 1976, Noel Edmonds presented the Radio 1 Breakfast show live from a flight from London to Aberdeen. During take-off, he played Fifth Dimension's Up & Away In My Beautiful Balloon, the needle on the record skipping as the plane's wheels left the ground.\n\n42. Except they didn't... the whole programme was an elaborate hoax for April Fool's Day.\n\n43. Jeff Young pioneered Radio 1's first dance music programme with his\"Big Beat\"show in 1987. Pete Tong and Dave Pearce picked up the mantle with Dance Anthems and the weekend Recovery Session - a breakfast show for clubbers - in the 1990s. \n\n44. Amy Winehouse's Live Lounge cover of Valerie by The Zutons was so popular it was later turned into a single in its own right, produced by Mark Ronson. It became one of her biggest hits, charting at number two (higher than the original, which peaked at nine).\n\n45. Emma Freud once introduced a song by an artist she called\"PJ and Harvey\"- raising the enticing prospect of indie queen PJ Harvey duetting with Ant and Dec's alter-egos PJ and Duncan.\n\n46. Laura Sayers, a former Radio 1 producer, met her husband through a feature on the Scott Mills show, which she was working on at the time. One Night With Laura saw Scott and the team scour the country to find a listener to be her new boyfriend. After trying to impress a panel of judges, the contestants were whittled down to a final four, before an eventual winner was chosen. However, Laura actually ended up marrying one of the runners-up, James Busson.\n\n47. In 1992, a poll conducted by Radio 1 saw listeners vote Stars by Simply Red as their favourite album.\n\n48. The most popular video on Radio 1's YouTube channel is Miley Cyrus's cover of Lana Del Rey's Summertime Sadness - which has more than 35 million views.\n\n49. In 2011, Radio 1 entered the Guinness World Records when Chris Moyles and his then-sidekick Comedy Dave presented the longest music radio show by a DJ team or duo, clocking in at more than 51 hours. Their record has since been broken and is currently held by Belgian DJs Eva Daeleman and Peter van De Veire, who broadcast non-stop for a staggering 100 hours in 2015.\n\n50. When it was first launched, the Radio 1 website had a considerably longer URL than it does now, as Pete Tong found out when he attempted to read it out on air.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

An EU official told it that the EU's Washington ambassador, David O'Sullivan, had not been invited to certain events last year.  \n\nAt the state funeral for the late President George HW Bush, on 5 December, the EU's ambassador was not called up in the usual chronological order, from the longest-serving to the newest ambassador,\"but he was called up as the last person\", the EU official said.\n\nThe previous day, in Brussels, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had questioned the EU's role, in a major policy speech.\n\n\"Brexit - if nothing else - was a political wake-up call.

and use of\"unnecessary\"force contributed to the rise.\n\nThe Prison Service said action was taken against the\"small minority that engaged in inappropriate behaviour\".\n\nMick Pimblett, assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers Association (POA), blamed some of the rises on inexperienced staff and a lack of training.\n\nThere were 2,511 investigations into alleged misconduct by 1,286 prison staff in England and Wales in 2018-19, according to figures obtained by BBC Radio Kent. \n\nPrior to that the number of investigations had been falling.\n\nIn the same time, 529 staff were disciplined, with 112 recommended for dismissal. \n\nNearly 500 investigations into allegations of\"breach of security\"in prisons took place in the year ending March 2019. \n\nThe charge covers a\"wide range of disciplinary offences\", which can include anything from leaving an internal gate unlocked to\"conveying unauthorised articles into a prison\", Mr Pimblett said.\n\nIn the same year there were 169 investigations launched into alleged assaults and unnecessary use of force on prisoners.\n\n'Unreasonable to roll on floor'\n\nMr Pimblett said use of force generally had increased since 2014\"due to the violent workplace prison officers have to work in\".\n\nThe Prison Service\"appears reluctant\"to provide personal protective equipment -

But like a trophy, it once adorned the house of a colonial official in Germany's administrative centre in Bagamoyo, before being spirited away to Germany at some point at the beginning of the 20th Century.\n\nThe skull was used as a symbol to intimidate the Wahehe people, who the chief had led in a fierce rebellion against the German colonisers.\n\nSo successful was his campaign in the 1890s that a bounty was put on his head by the Germans. He is believed to have eventually taken his own life in 1898, rather than submit to the humiliation of being captured, as he sheltered in a cave that was encircled by German soldiers.\n\nTwo decades later, the fate of his skull was on the minds of the diplomats who spent months arguing over the settlement of World War One.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles, which established the League of Nations and detailed the reparations Germany had to pay for starting the conflict, runs to tens of thousands of words amounting to 440 clauses, or articles, plus several annexes.\n\nChaotic negotiations\n\nHundreds of diplomats from around the world, holed up in the French capital, Paris, drafted and redrafted the articles. The chaotic nature of the process may have allowed the fate of Chief Mkwawa's skull to be snuck into the text - largely thanks to the efforts of Horace Byatt, a British colonial administrator in East Africa.\n\nHistorian Jeremiah Garsha has found a letter Byatt sent just three days after the end of the war in November 1918, which lobbied to have the skull returned from Germany, saying it would give\"satisfaction\"to the Wahehe people, offering\"tangible proof in the eyes of the natives that German power has been completely broken\".\n\nIt is likely he had another motive - to show that the British, who had seized control of German territories in East Africa, were now in charge. But while the four leaders of the main allied powers gave the idea a sympathetic hearing, they were not convinced.\n\nMr Garsha has found minutes from one of their meetings in February 1919, in which it was said that the impact on the Wahehe people was\"hardly sufficient for the inclusion [of the skull] in the venerable peace treaty\".\n\n'Craniological curiosity'\n\nThat should have been the end of it, but some in the British camp, including Colonial Secretary Viscount Milner, were keen on the issue and spotted an opportunity in the section of the treaty that dealt with reparations.\n\nChief Mkwawa's full name:\n\nSome countries wanted to see Germany return artefacts and art works and Mr Garsha argues that it was Milner's description of the skull as a\"craniological curiosity\"that allowed it to be seen as an object of art.\n\nAnd so under a section headed\"special provisions\"and sandwiched between demands from France and Belgium sits article 246:\"Within six months\u2026 Germany will hand over to His Britannic Majesty's Government the skull of the Sultan Mkwawa, which was removed from the Protectorate of German East Africa and taken to Germany.\"\n\nHowever, the skull was not returned within six months - it took another 35 years for this to happen.\n\nWhat WW1's end meant for Africa\n\nBy Martin Plaut\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles helped shape modern Africa as Germany renounced sovereignty over its former colonies and Article 22 converted these into League of Nations mandate territories, to be run by the former allied powers. \n\nTogoland was divided between France and Britain, the French part becoming modern-day Togo and the British part joining Ghana. Kamerun (Cameroon) was also partitioned between the two allies. Ruanda (Rwanda) and Urundi (Burundi) were given to Belgium. Britain received German East Africa (Tanzania), while German South-West Africa (Namibia) went to South Africa. \n\nSouth Africa's mandate over Namibia became hotly contested because of the imposition of apartheid, and was finally terminated by the UN in 1961. The partition of Cameroon is a factor in the current conflict between the country's Anglophone and Francophone populations. \n\nInitially, Germany denied it had Chief Mkwawa's skull but for the British it remained an important symbol that they wanted to use to their advantage.\n\nSo when it seemed the skull had resurfaced in the German town of Bremen in the 1950s, the British governor of what was then Tanganyika, Edward Twining, was quick to take action.\n\nHe went to investigate the collection of human remains a curator had found as he catalogued artefacts that had been stored for safety during World War Two.\n\nTwining was keen to capitalise on the reputation of Mkwawa as a hero and brave warrior - the chief who in 1891 had led his troops armed with spears to victory over the Germans, killing 300 of their soldiers and capturing their guns at a battle at Lugalo. \n\nThe Wahehe had been pushing north and winning territory in East Africa throughout the second half of the 19th Century as Germany sought to take control of the region. \n\nThree years later, the Germans marshalled their troops, this time bringing powerful cannons to overwhelm the Wahehe forces.\n\nBut Mkwawa evaded capture for four more years, until surrounded at his hideout he decided to take his own life.\n\nCrude forensics\n\nGovernor Twining believed that although Mkwawa had killed himself, the Germans shot him through the head to make sure he was dead.\n\nThis was an important clue when identifying the skull, using crude forensics.\n\nHe measured the diameter of a large hole in the skull and said it matched the calibre of the type of bullet the Germans would have used.\n\nAt the ceremony that saw the return of the skull to Kalenga, Twining did not dwell on the chief's anti-colonial credentials, instead speaking of honour being restored and how he felt the skull had come back to the Wahehe as a source of protection.\n\nMore on Germany's colonial legacy:\n\nBut then he struck his bargain:\"I hope too that you and your people will continue to give your unstinted loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II and her heirs and successors.\"\n\nFor Twining that loyalty extended to fighting in Britain's colonial force known as the King's African Rifles (KAR) - a military and security unit that was recruited from East Africa.\n\n\"It would be a great pity if the Hehe became soft and lost their martial qualities,\"he added.\n\nA recruiting officer from the KAR was at the ceremony, ready to sign up 70 young people.\n\nMr Garsha told the BBC this happened in 1954 at the height of the anti-colonial Mau Mau rebellion in neighbouring Kenya - and KAR soldiers were being used to pursue a brutal crackdown. \n\nThere is some irony that the memory of this anti-colonial figure was being invoked to help the colonialists.\n\nBut 1954 was also the year that Julius Nyerere formed the Tanganyika African National Union, which successfully campaigned for independence from Britain, granted in 1961.\n\nWhile at one time colonialists may have hoped Chief Mkwawa's skull would help curry favour, it served as a symbol for an independent and proud Tanzania - and still sits in its own museum in Kalenga.\n\n\"It gives us a chance to be proud of people who resisted the colonisers,\"Eric Jordan from the museum told the BBC.\nTL;DR: The Treaty of Versailles, signed exactly a century ago, reshaped Europe in the wake of World War One. So why, within its many hundreds of clauses, does the treaty refer to the decapitated head of an African anti-colonial hero?\n\nArticle: The Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) carried out a survey of 210 businesses on behalf of Transport Scotland.\n\nThe results suggest 70% of respondents rated the A9 as\"poor or very poor\"for safety.\n\nBetween 60% and 77% gave the same rating for the A96.\n\nBoth trunk roads are the subject of projects to upgrade them.\n\nThe A9 from Inverness to Perth is due to be fully dual carriageway by 2025. The cost of the work is expected to run to \u00a33bn.\n\nThe A96 is to be dual carriageway all the way from Inverness to Aberdeen by 2030.\n\nThere have been calls from campaigners and a group of Free Church of Scotland ministers for the A9 work to be accelerated.\n\n'Ambitious dualling'\n\nSCDI also gathered comments from businesses on the benefits of improving the routes. Firms said the upgrades would lead to:\n\nMichael Urquhart, SCDI Highlands and Islands chairman, said businesses\"clearly regarded the roads to be sub-standard\".\n\nHe said:\"Businesses highlight that the greatest benefits of dualling both the A9 and A96 would be to increase the attractiveness of the north of Scotland for investment, reduce transport costs, improve business confidence, and make journeys safer. \n\n\"Improvements to these trunk roads to enable increased economic development have been high priorities for SCDI for many years and this report provides a strong case for the Scottish government to continue to make progress with this work.\"\n\n'Many benefits'\n\nTransport Minister Keith Brown said the Scottish government was committed to improving the routes.\n\nHe said:\"Dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness and the A96 between Inverness and Aberdeen will bring many benefits for businesses who use these vital routes to transport goods or to connect with the commercial centres of Perth, Inverness or Aberdeen and further afield.\n\n\"Infrastructure investment by this government, such as these ambitious dualling programmes, is fundamental to delivering sustainable economic growth, supporting jobs and enabling businesses to grow.\"\nTL;DR: Businesspeople believe the A9 and A96 are unsafe and that journeys on them take too long, according to new research.\n\nArticle: On Saturday morning Dr Gregor Smith shared a picture of a soldier carrying a donkey through a minefield.\n\nThe image, apparently taken during the Second World War, also featured an explanation of its significance.\n\nIf the animal was left to its own devices it would wander freely, detonate a charge and kill others.\n\nIt concluded:\"The moral of the story is that during difficult times the first ones you have to control are the jackasses who don't understand the danger and do as they please.\"\n\n'Recklessness'\n\nScotland's deputy chief medical officer composed his own message to accompany the picture.\n\nIt read:\"Please. You can do your bit to save lives this weekend and ensure our NHS is able to help those who really need it. Even if the weather is bright and warm, it's important we stay home. Don't let your actions or recklessness allow #COVID19 to spread.\"\n\nBut as Dr Smith hit the tweet button he could not have predicted the sequence of events that would play out over a remarkable weekend.\n\nAnd he could not have imagined that one of those who would ignore the Scottish government's no nonsense advice, that very day, was the country's chief medical officer.\n\nA Scottish Sun investigation, published online on Saturday night, revealed Dr Catherine Calderwood, had brazenly flouted her own regulations by visiting her second home on the Fife coast.\n\nAn apology was followed by a press briefing on Sunday during which it emerged Dr Calderwood had also travelled from Edinburgh to Earlsferry the previous weekend.\n\nAs pressure mounted the chief medical officer was cautioned by Police Scotland and, after further talks with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, she announced her resignation at 21:54.\n\nOn Monday morning Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland Dr Smith will now lead the team of clinicians spearheading the fight against corornavirus.\n\nIt includes Prof Fiona McQueen, chief nursing officer, and Prof Jason Leitch, the national clinical director.\n\nMs Freeman said the team had been immersed in Covid-19 response for many weeks now and would continue to advise the first minister on what needed to be done.\n\nThe health secretary also said it would be up to Ms Sturgeon whether a recruitment process would be opened to appoint a successor to Dr Calderwood.\n\nIn the meantime, Dr Smith steps up as the country is entering its third week of lockdown and the virus has yet to peak.\n\nIn the days and weeks ahead the GP, who spent most of his career in Larkhall, faces a daunting challenge.\n\n'Passionate advocate'\n\nDr Smith, a former medical director for primary care in NHS Lanarkshire, started working for Scottish government as a medical adviser in primary care in 2012.\n\nHe later led the development of a new quality framework for general practice in Scotland and was appointed deputy chief medical officer in 2015.\n\nDr Smith's profile on the Realistic Medicine website describes him as a\"passionate advocate of person-centred approaches to care\". \n\nThis involves working in partnership with organisations such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Forestry Commission to promote exercise outdoors.\n\nThe avid cyclist is also an honorary clinical associate professor at Glasgow University and a Salzburg Global Fellow.\n\nHeavy metal\n\nAs well as praising his NHS colleagues the guitar-playing medic often shares his love of music on his Twitter account, most recently expressing his admiration for The Foo Fighters.\n\nHe also recently responded to an appeal from heavy metal icons Iron Maiden for fans' most memorable moments.\n\nDr Smith wrote:\"How do I single out one moment across 40 years? Maiden have been an anchor through bad and good times in my life. \n\n\"But singing along to The Clansman in Aberdeen with 5,000 Scots screaming Freedom at the top of the voice was pretty special. Thanks guys.\"\n\nLess than 48 hours after posting his\"jackasses\"tweet he now finds himself leading Scotland's medical response to the pandemic.\n\nIf the keen runner's promotion was a sprint what lies ahead is a marathon.\nTL;DR: Dr Gregor Smith has been appointed Scotland's interim chief medical officer following the resignation of Dr Catherine Calderwood who had led the country's strategy on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. So what do we know about Dr Smith? BBC news online's Paul O'Hare takes a look.\n\nArticle: Gurajdeep Malhi, of Stafford, appeared before North Staffordshire magistrates accused of wounding PC Claire Bond with intent to do grievous bodily harm. \n\nPC Bond suffered multiple leg fractures and a broken kneecap while responding to reports of a car crashing into a garage in Coton Fields, Stafford.\n\nA second officer was also hit but has since been discharged from hospital.\n\nMr Malhi, of Charnley Road, was also charged with driving dangerously, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. \n\nHe was remanded in custody to appear before Stafford Crown Court on 26 October. \n\nMr Malhi appeared jointly at the court with Lucy Maria Bullmore, 30, of Morton Road, Stafford, who was charged with driving a Range Rover Evoque dangerously and failing to provide a specimen for breath analysis. \n\nBoth defendants were not required to enter any pleas and spoke only to confirm their name, address, date of birth and nationality. \n\nMs Bullmore was granted conditional bail to appear at Stafford Crown Court on 29 October.\nTL;DR: A 25-year-old man has appeared in court charged with wounding a police officer who was hit by a car. \n\n\n\nArticle: French President Emmanuel Macron announced the decision, putting an end to speculation that the spire would be rebuilt in a modern style.\n\nMr Macron had previously hinted he was in favour of a\"contemporary gesture\".\n\nHowever he has said he wants the restoration to be completed by 2024, when Paris is hosting the Olympics.\n\nThe Elys\u00e9e said Mr Macron's main concern was\"not delaying the reconstruction and making it complicated - things had to be cleared up quickly\".\n\nIt added that the process of designing a modern spire, with an international competition for architects, could have caused unnecessary delays.\n\n\"The president trusts the experts and approved the main outlines of the project presented by the chief architect which plans to reconstruct the spire identically,\"the Elys\u00e9e said.\n\nThe announcement followed a meeting of France's national heritage and architecture commission (CNPA).\n\nWhen the 13th century roof of the Paris cathedral caught fire during restoration works in April 2019 it sparked a vast outpouring of emotion, as well as donations from across the world. \n\nWithin two days about \u20ac900m ($1bn; \u00a3805m) had been raised for the cathedral's restoration.\n\nThe cathedral's first spire was built in the 13th Century, but due to extensive damage it was removed in the late 18th Century. Its replacement, designed by architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, was built in the mid-19th Century.\n\nSince last year's fire, discussion over how to restore the spire has been tense. \n\nJean-Louis Georgelin, the army general put in charge of the reconstruction effort, wanted a modern alternative. This idea appeared briefly to have President Macron's backing, when he said he would be in favour of a\"contemporary gesture\".\n\nThis sparked a wave of unconventional proposals from architects around the world - including one design with a rooftop pool, and another with a giant park and greenhouse on the roof.\n\nBut the cathedral's chief architect Philippe Villeneuve spoke out strongly in favour of a faithful restoration to the previous, 19th Century design.\n\nIn one particularly heated exchange last November, Gen Georgelin told Mr Villeneuve to\"shut his mouth\"- causing audible gasps in a meeting of the National Assembly's cultural affairs committee.\nTL;DR: The spire of Notre Dame cathedral, which was destroyed in a fire last April, will be restored according to the original Gothic design.\n\nArticle: By Joe MillerBBC News, Davos\n\nThat's the verdict of veteran journalist Alan Murray, now chief content officer at Time Inc, the parent company of Time and Fortune magazines.\n\n\"Trump has been good for the economic viability of the American media,\"he says, citing the bump in digital subscriptions at the New York Times, the Washington Post and the increase in traffic at his own business in the wake of the presidential election.\n\n\"But I think he has been bad for the credibility of the media\".\n\nThere is research to back him up. According to public relation behemoth Edelman's latest\"trust barometer\", the media has become the least-trusted institution in the world. In the US, more than 70% of Donald Trump's supporters distrust mainstream outlets.  \n\nThis, Mr Murray warns, is having a corrosive effect on the business of journalism in America - despite an increasingly engaged audience.\n\n'Dual crisis'\n\n\"The media in the US is in the midst of two simultaneous crises, which predated Donald Trump,\"he explains, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\n\"One is an economic crisis: how do we make enough money to support what we do?\"\n\n\"The other is a credibility crisis. In a world where anyone can be a publisher, and people are sitting in their pyjamas in their bedrooms putting out stuff on Facebook and the internet - how do people know what to believe?\"\n\nThat task, he adds, is made all the more difficult by the man in the Oval Office.\n\n\"It's very difficult when the president takes things that simply have no basis in truth and puts them into his Twitter feed,\"says Mr Murray, referring to when Donald Trump took aim at one of Mr Murray's own publications, Time.\n\nLast November, the president tweeted that:\"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named'Man (Person) of the Year' like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway\"\n\nThis claim, says Mr Murray, was\"just completely untrue.\"\n\n\"I was well aware of the thought that went into who was going to be Person of the Year this year, Trump was never on the list.\"\n\nNo one, he says, has ever been Person of the Year two years in a row.\n\nAt the time, Mr Murray took to his own Twitter feed to set the record straight, but he says this entertaining saga is emblematic of a more serious attack on the press in the US.\n\nBen Smith, editor in chief of what Donald Trump has termed a\"failing pile of garbage\", otherwise known as Buzzfeed News, agrees.\n\n\"For any given media outlet, being attacked by the President of the United States for an accurate story that he is unhappy with, draws attention to that story, draws attention to your reporting,\"he says.\n\nIt also, in the case of Buzzfeed, helps shift some tongue-in-cheek merchandise -\"failing pile of garbage\"T-shirts and bumper stickers.\n\n\"The sum, though, of the president and his allies' attacks on the idea of a legitimate press is incredibly damaging.\"\n\n'Failing at failing'\n\nFor Elisabeth Bumiller, Washington bureau chief of the New York Times and a veteran White House watcher, the best response to such attacks is robust journalism, which, she claims, is serving her newspaper well.\n\n\"I think globally we are seen as very tough on the president,\"she says, when asked about what the Oval Office has done for the Gray Lady's reputation (as the New York Times is known).\n\n\"He refers to us constantly as the failing New York Times,\"an exhausted Ms Bumiller adds.\n\n\"I like to say that the failing New York Times is even failing at failing, and we have record high readership and interest.\"\n\nMr Murray's publications are also doing well - Time Inc (soon to be subsumed into Meredith Corp) attracts 140 million unique visitors to its sites a month, and its print magazines still have the power to create international headlines.\n\nBut he cautions that increasingly, links to stories by Time and Fortune on social media are indistinguishable from less trustworthy - or even downright fake - news outlets.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, he says, may be a bigger cause of upheaval for the US media than Donald Trump. \n\n\"Facebook and Google to some extent have helped lead the confusion that people have about what can be trusted and what can't,\"he says, echoing a warning from billionaire investor George Soros, issued at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe answer, he says, lies in good old-fashioned branding. \n\n\"There have to be strong brands that people trust and believe in, in order for them to get news they can feel confident in,\"he says, adding that appearing to be fair and impartial is vital to this endeavour.\n\n\"Branding is basically a shortcut to trust\"\n\n'Trends on our side'\n\nBuzzfeed News, which piggy-backed on a popular online entertainment brand, has been growing too, both in stature and audience.\n\nBut although the company recently announced layoffs and a broad restructuring plan, Ben Smith says he is\"optimistic about the business of news,\"particularly when it comes to the digital media.\n\n\"The underlying trends - the shift towards social media, the shift towards mobile consumption are on our side,\"he says.\n\nAnd what of the bogeyman of many an online newsroom, Mark Zuckerberg?\n\n\"We are less dependent on Facebook than we were a year, or two years, or three years ago,\"says Mr Smith, defiantly.\n\nThe former Politico writer is also less pessimistic than many in his industry about the proposed changes to Facebook's news feed, which would make posts from businesses, brands and media less prominent, under the guise of cracking down on fake news outlets.\n\nBut did executives from the Silicon Valley giant consult Buzzfeed - after all a driver of huge amounts of interaction on social media networks - about the tectonic shift in Facebook's algorithm?\n\nMr Smith chuckles:\"If only\".\nTL;DR: The Donald giveth, and the Donald taketh away.\n\nArticle: Lawyers for the young woman - who suffers from lupus and kidney failure - had argued that continuing the pregnancy would place her life at risk. \n\nThe foetus itself is missing part or all of its brain. \n\nAll abortions are prohibited in El Salvador under any circumstances.  \n\nThe constitution in the majority Roman Catholic country protects the right to life\"from the moment of conception\".\n\nThe 22-year-old woman - referred to as\"Beatriz\", not her real name - is said to be in fragile health, suffering from the chronic immune disorder lupus as well as kidney failure.\n\nTests suggest her 26-week-old foetus is developing without a complete brain, a condition called anencephaly.

And why, with both Iran and the US struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, has there been this return to stoking tensions? \n\nThe immediate reason for President Trump's terse message was an episode last week, when several armed speedboats operated by the IRGC Navy, harassed - the US says - a passing flotilla of US warships in the Gulf. \n\nThese vessels included the USS Lewis B Puller, an expeditionary mobile base vessel, and the destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton. \n\nThe US Navy says that in one incident an Iranian gunboat crossed some 10 yards (9m) in front of a US Coast Guard cutter at high speed. \n\nThe IRGC admitted that there had been an encounter, but blamed the Americans. \n\nIts commander-in-chief, Gen Hossein Salami, said on Thursday that he had ordered Iran's naval forces\"to destroy any American terrorist force in the Persian Gulf\", as he put it,\"that threatens the security of Iran's military or civilian shipping\".   \n\nThe fear now is that hostile manoeuvring and a war of words could turn into actions.\n\nNonetheless, President Trump's\"order\"on Twitter changes little. \n\nThe commanders of US warships in the Gulf already have the ability to take whatever measures they believe are necessary to protect the lives of their crews and the safety of their vessels.\n\nThey are well used to the swarming tactics of small Iranian boats. \n\nBut this episode shows that for all the global attention on the pandemic, pre-existing international tensions have not gone away. They may even have been exacerbated. \n\nThat is because the US and Iran have consistent strategic goals with regard to each other which have not changed. Iran wants to reduce US influence in the region and to expand its own footprint. \n\nA recent uptick in Israeli air strikes in Syria, for example, suggests that Iran and its allies are still actively pursuing this goal there.\n\nSome of Iran's leaders - and there is a danger that the chaos and uncertainty prompted by the Covid-19 crisis will simply strengthen hardliners - may feel that the US, given its own struggles at home, will have little enthusiasm for a set-to in the Gulf.\n\nEqually, the Trump administration is doubling down on its policy of\"maximum pressure\"on Iran, seemingly in the belief - not shared by the vast majority of regional experts that I have listened to - that the pandemic could ultimately prompt the collapse of the Islamic regime in Tehran. \n\nMeanwhile, Iran is continuing to make advances on other fronts.\n\nIts launch on Wednesday of what the IRGC claimed to be a military satellite, using a rocket that appears to rely upon North Korean technology, indicates that its missile programme is continuing to improve.\n\nAnd while Iran nominally remains within a 2015 agreement with world powers that limited its nuclear activities, it is in breach of many of its terms. \n\nIndeed, experts worry that, while many of the steps taken by Tehran are reversible, it may be moving to a position where it can manufacture carbon fibre centrifuges - the essential machinery for uranium enrichment - in a clandestine way, beyond international inspection.\n\nThe US-Iran tensions might matter less if they had been temporarily put on the back-burner. But they clearly have not. \n\nAnd the risk of an accidental conflict erupting remains as great as ever; perhaps more so given that each may be misunderstanding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic upon the other's capacity for action.\nTL;DR: Last year, President Donald Trump in a speech stated that America's revolutionary army back in the 1770s \"took over the airports\" from the British.\n\nArticle: By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter\n\nThe band announced last week they have recorded two new songs, which will be released later this year.\n\n\"I don't feel that we have to prove anything,\"Benny told BBC News.\"I don't feel we have to think about,'Oh, what if it was better before?'\n\n\"Maybe it was, but we can't care about that. We do it because we think it was a good thing to do.\"\n\nHe added:\"We enjoyed it very much. We'll see. I hope you'll like them.\"\n\nHe said the songs came about while he and Bjorn Ulvaeus were in the studio working on a project where the band will tour as avatars. \n\n\"So we said,'Hmm, maybe we should try and write a couple of songs, ask the ladies if they want to come in and sing'. And they said,'Yeah, absolutely'. So it was just, out of pure joy I'd say.\"\n\nHe also revealed further details about the sound of the two new tracks - but added that they haven't been completed yet.\n\n\"One of the songs is like we would've written it [for] today. The other, we could've written in 1972. So I don't know, we'll see. I mean, they're not finished yet. \n\n\"We have the vocals, they're all recorded, we haven't mixed it, we haven't worked them through, really, but I think they're pretty good.\"\n\nAsked whether he thought it would complement Abba's legacy, Bjorn said:\"I think so. It certainly sounds Abba very much.\"\n\nBenny added:\"As soon as Frida [Anni-Frid Lyngstad] and Agnetha [Faltskog] start singing, that's when it sounds Abba.\"\n\nThe pair were speaking at the press night for Chess, the stage show they wrote with lyricist Sir Tim Rice.\n\nThe musical has just returned to London's West End. The production, from English National Opera, stars Michael Ball and Alexandra Burke.\n\nSet during the Cold War, the musical tells the story of a chess tournament between two men - grandmasters from the US and Russia.\n\nAs their rivalry simmers on the chess board, the pair also fight over a woman who manages the American grandmaster - but falls in love with the Russian.\n\nThe first reviews for the new production have been mixed.\n\n\"Do not miss this bold, brash and brilliant revival,\"said the review in the Daily Express.\n\nThe Daily Mail, meanwhile, said:\"This production has admirable ambition, a couple of spine-tingler moments and enough musical muscle to reach the [London] Coliseum's august rafters.\"\n\nBut not everyone was so complimentary, with Time Out writing:\"This revival feels like a gambit that hasn't paid off.\"\n\n\"It's a mess,\"agreed The Stage.\"A gross disservice to a great musical.\n\n\"The only consistently decent performance is from Alexandra Burke as Svetlana, although she barely features in Act I and has a supplementary song to give her more to do.\"\n\nChess isn't Alexandra's first foray into theatre - she has previously starred in Sister Act and The Bodyguard.\n\nSpeaking to BBC News after the show, the singer said:\"I'm really excited that Benny and Bjorn came tonight, they've been a part of this process, they've been so hands on that it makes you, as an actress go, wow, what a privilege that we are in this current situation.\"\n\nShe also joked:\"By the way, the Abba reunion needs a fifth person! Hi, it can be me, I can do the backing vocals!\"\n\nMichael Ball said having to learn his character's chess moves for the show was even more difficult than learning the songs and dance routines.\n\n\"I have never done anything more difficult than learning chessography,\"he joked.\n\n\"Literally, sitting in a room, and with every move and learning what moves when - it's 87 moves I do in all. And having to do it in time, to the right bit of the music. It was a challenge.\"\n\nThe chess games are exact recreations of real-life games played by US and Russian grandmasters.\n\nBall added:\"The only way, I think, of doing a show like this is to do it with that size of an orchestra, that size of a cast. Because the music, the orchestration, that sort of classical feel that suddenly turns into this awesome rock band, it's the best score.\"\n\nAsked what attracted him to the role, he said simply:\"Benny and Bjorn.\n\n\"I liked Abba when they weren't fashionable, you know? I never deserted Abba. I genuinely think their music is extraordinary, I've been obsessed with this score... and the thought of being able to do it this scale, I'm having the best time, can you tell?!\"\n\nBenny told the BBC:\"To present the show this way, with a full orchestra, full choir, wonderful principals and great guys at the sound desk, it's a thrill. I really really enjoyed it.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But Caerphilly said it was reviewing the policy.\n\nThe charity Disability Wales said the charges come at a time when disabled people could afford it least as they faced benefit cuts and welfare reform. \n\n\"Charging blue badge recipients to park is not new and unfortunately is in fact becoming increasingly common due to local authority funding shortfalls,\"said a Disability Wales spokesperson.  \n\n\"Disability Wales are against car parking charges for blue badge recipients as its seen as an additional tax on disability.\"\n\nBrian Williams organises a support group for people with multiple sclerosis.\n\nAs a sufferer himself, he is also a driver with a blue badge but that does not entitle him to free parking in his local area, Caerphilly. \n\nFinancial pressures \n\n\"On one occasion people may say it's an insignificant amount up to three or four hours, but if you wanted to go three or four times to do it it's soon going to add up and it's going to erode any sort of income that people have,\"said Mr Williams.\n\nBridgend council had been considering introducing charges for blue badge holders but decided against it last week.\n\n\"Most disabled people don't have a choice. They have to use their car to come into town.\"said Simon Green of Bridgend Coalition for Disabled People.\n\n\"Most people can choose whether they walk, whether they catch the bus or whether they take their car. A lot of public transport is not fully accessible for the disabled, so it's the right decision.\"\n\nThe Welsh government said it was up to local authorities whether to charge and councils argued they were facing severe financial pressures of their own.\n\nPlaid Cymru's equalities spokesperson Lindsay Whittle said:\"I'd like to see local authorities that currently charge review whether they are still appropriate.\"\nTL;DR: Disabled drivers with blue badges are being charged to park at council-run car parks in almost a third of local authority areas in Wales, figures show.\n\nArticle: It blamed a rise in labour costs, interest payments, utility bills, repairs and depreciation for the fall.\n\nIts chairman, Brexit supporter Tim Martin, who generally accompanies results announcements with his colourful opinions,  expressed concern that Brexit would be reversed.\n\nThis, he said, would have\"adverse economic consequences\".\n\nHe blamed\"the establishment\"for a\"barrage of negative economic forecasts\".\n\nMr Martin is currently touring 100 of his 900 pubs, talking to punters about the merits of leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March. \n\nThe company, which also owns pubs in Ireland, is replacing champagne and prosecco with non-European Union sparkling wines.\n\nThere has also been a switch in the beers available. Wheat beer and alcohol-free beer from the UK are replacing beers brewed in Germany.\n\nAlthough profits fell sharply, sales at the chain are continuing to rise.\n\nWetherspoon's revenues rose by 7%, and like-for-like sales by more than 6%.\n\nRichard Hunter, of Interactive Investor, said the industry as a whole was struggling:\"The wafer-thin margins within the industry are susceptible to any spike in costs, which leaves the pubs vulnerable from an investment perspective.\"\nTL;DR: Profits at UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon fell 19% in the six months to the end of January.\n\nArticle: By Rebecca MorelleScience Correspondent, BBC News\n\nMarine archaeologists say the object is an astrolabe, an instrument once used by mariners to measure the altitude of the Sun during their voyages.\n\nIt is believed to date from between 1495 and 1500. \n\nThe item was recovered from a Portuguese explorer which sank during a storm in the Indian Ocean in 1503.\n\nThe boat was called the Esmeralda and was part of a fleet led by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first person to sail directly from Europe to India.\n\nDavid Mearns, from Blue Water Recovery, who led the excavation and is the author of The Shipwreck Hunter, told the BBC:\"It's a great privilege to find something so rare, something so historically important, something that will be studied by the archaeological community and fills in a gap.\"\n\nThe astrolabe was discovered by Mr Mearns in 2014, and was one of nearly 3,000 artefacts recovered during a series of dives.\n\nThe bronze disc measures 17.5cm in diameter and is less than 2mm thick.\n\n\"It was like nothing else we had seen and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it,\"said Mr Mearns. \n\n\"One I recognised immediately as a Portuguese coat of arms... and another which we later discovered was the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, the King of Portugal at the time.\"\n\nThe excavation team believed the object was an astrolabe, but they could not see any navigational markings on it.\n\nHowever, a later analysis uncovered its hidden details.\n\nLaser scanning work carried out by scientists at the University of Warwick revealed etches around the edge of the disc, each separated by five degrees.\n\nThis would have allowed mariners to measure the height of the sun above the horizon at noon to determine their location so they could find their way on the high seas.\n\nMariners' astrolabes are relatively rare, and this is only the 108th to be confirmed catalogued. It is also the earliest known example by several decades.\n\nMr Mearns said:\"We know it had to have been made before 1502, because that's when the ship left Lisbon and Dom Manuel didn't become King until 1495, and this astrolabe wouldn't have carried the emblem of the King unless he was King. \n\n\"I believe it's probably fair to say it dates roughly to between 1495 to 1500. Exactly what year we don't know - but it is in that narrow period.\"\n\nHe added:\"It rolls back this history by at least 30 years -  it adds to evolution, it adds to the history, and hopefully astrolabes from this period can be found.\"\n\nFollow Rebecca Morelle on Twitter.\nTL;DR: An artefact excavated from a shipwreck off the coast of Oman has been found to be the oldest known example of a type of navigational tool.\n\nArticle: He said France would not surrender its core values after visiting the Notre-Dame basilica in the southern city. An extra 4,000 troops are being deployed to protect churches and schools.\n\nIn Nice, one elderly victim was\"virtually beheaded\", officials said. Another woman and a man also died.\n\nA male suspect was shot and detained.\n\nAnti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation into the attack and France has raised its national security alert to its highest level.\n\nFrench anti-terrorist prosecutor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ricard later said the attacker was seriously wounded by police.\n\nMr Ricard said the suspect was a 21-year-old Tunisian national who had arrived in France earlier this month. He had a document issued by the Italian Red Cross.\n\nPolice sources earlier named the attacker as Brahim Aioussaoi. They said he had travelled by boat from Tunisia to the Italian island of Lampedusa in September. He was placed in coronavirus quarantine there before being released and told to leave Italy. \n\nNice Mayor Christian Estrosi spoke of\"Islamo-fascism\"and said the suspect had\"repeated endlessly'Allahu Akbar' (God is greatest)\".\n\nTwo other attacks took place on Thursday, one in France and one in Saudi Arabia.\n\nA man was shot dead in Montfavet near the southern French city of Avignon after threatening police with a handgun.\n\nA guard was attacked outside the French consulate in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. A suspect was arrested and the guard taken to hospital.\n\nSpeaking after visiting Nice, President Macron said:\"If we are attacked once again it is for the values which are ours: freedom, for the possibility on our soil to believe freely and not to give in to any spirit of terror.\n\n\"I say it with great clarity once again today: we won't surrender anything.\"\n\nThe president said the number of soldiers being deployed to protect public places across the country would rise from 3,000 to 7,000.\n\nMr Estrosi compared the attack to the recent murder of teacher Samuel Paty, who was beheaded close to his school outside Paris earlier this month.\n\nPolice have not suggested a motive for the attack in Nice. However, it follows days of protests in some Muslim-majority countries triggered by President Macron's defence of the publication of cartoons that depicted the Prophet Mohammed. There have been calls in some countries for a boycott of French goods.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nAll three were attacked inside the basilica on Thursday morning before the first Mass of the day.\n\nTwo died inside the church: a 60-year-old woman who was\"virtually beheaded\", and a 55-year-old man whose throat was cut.\n\nThe male victim was a lay member of staff responsible for the upkeep of the church. He reportedly had a wife and two children. \n\nAnother woman, aged 44, managed to flee to a nearby cafe after being stabbed several times, but died later.\n\nIt later emerged that a witness had managed to raise the alarm with a special protection system set up by the city.\n\nChloe, a witness who lives near the church, told the BBC:\"We heard many people shouting in the street. We saw from the window that there were many, many policemen coming, and gunshots, many gunshots.\"\n\nTom Vannier, a journalism student who arrived at the scene just after the attack, told the BBC that people were crying on the street.\n\nFour police officers arrived at the scene at 08:57 local time (07:57 GMT) and the attacker was shot and detained shortly afterwards, the French anti-terrorist prosecutor said. \n\nFour years ago Nice was the scene of terrorist attack, when a Tunisian drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on 14 July, killing 86 people. \n\nDisorientated and frightened\n\nThe terrorist threat level in France is as high now as it was in 2015-16, the terrible days of Charlie Hebdo, Bataclan, the Nice lorry-killer and the murder of Father Hamel in his church in Rouen. Things were bad enough then - and many more people died in those attacks. So why does this outbreak of Islamist violence feel somehow more scary? \n\nOne reason must be the symbolism of the Samuel Paty beheading. That a simple history teacher could be murdered - and not randomly but actually selected for murder - has been deeply unsettling for French people. Likewise the targeting today of Christian worshippers in Nice.\n\nBut it is also the context: the instant logic of action-response that followed President Macron's robust defence of secularism at Samuel Paty's memorial 10 days ago. All it took was a speech, then there were the threats, then there were the deaths.\n\nWith a new Covid lockdown providing an eerie backdrop to these events, small wonder the French are feeling disoriented and frightened.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nA minute's silence was held in the National Assembly.\n\nThe French Council of the Muslim Faith condemned the attack and spoke of its solidarity with the victims and their families.\n\nTurkey, which has seen ties with France sour in recent days over remarks by Mr Macron, strongly condemned the\"savage\"attack.\n\nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said the killings had\"brought death to a place of love and consolation\".\n\nWhat's the context?\n\nThursday's attack has echoes of another attack earlier this month near a school north-west of Paris. Samuel Paty, who was a teacher in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, was beheaded days after showing controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to some of his pupils.\n\nThe murder has heightened tensions in France and the government's attempt to crack down on what Mr Macron described as\"Islamist separatism\"has angered Turkey and other countries.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was among those calling for a boycott of French goods.\n\nThe situation worsened after a cartoon on Mr Erdogan appeared in the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.\n\nA timeline of recent attacks in France \n\nOctober 2020: French teacher Samuel Paty is beheaded outside a school in a suburb of Paris\n\nSeptember 2020: Two people are stabbed and seriously hurt in Paris near the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, where Islamist militants carried out a deadly attack in 2015\n\nOctober 2019: Radicalised police computer operator Micka\u00ebl Harpon is shot dead after stabbing to death three officers and a civilian worker at Paris police headquarters            \n\nJuly 2016: Two attackers kill a priest, Jacques Hamel, and seriously wound another hostage after storming a church in a suburb of Rouen in northern France\n\nJuly 2016: A gunman drives a large lorry into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group\n\nNovember 2015: Gunmen and suicide bombers launch multiple co-ordinated attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars in Paris, leaving 130 people dead and hundreds wounded\n\nJanuary 2015: Two Islamist militant gunmen force their way into Charlie Hebdo's offices and shoot dead 12 people\nTL;DR: Three people have died in a knife attack at a church in Nice, in what French President Emmanuel Macron said was an \"Islamist terrorist attack\".\n\nArticle: But Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say it is\"simply not true\"they are in litigation with the government and it is a\"poor excuse\".\n\nThey have repeated their demand for a meeting with the PM to discuss their call for an inquiry into the pandemic.\n\nDowning Street said it had nothing to add to the PM's comments.\n\nCovid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say they have written five times to Mr Johnson to request a meeting.\n\nAsked about the letters, in a live TV interview last week, the prime minister said he would\"of course\"meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19.\n\nBut days later he wrote to the group to say he was\"unable\"to meet them.\n\n'Frustration'\n\nThe group, which says it represents 1,600 families, said it was\"devastated\"to receive the letter, which it has made public.\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer - who met the group in July - asked if Mr Johnson would change his mind, saying the PM\"will understand the frustration and the hurt of those families that he said one thing to camera and another thing to them\".\n\nMr Johnson said:\"Of course I would be very happy to meet the families of the bereaved and sympathise deeply with all those who have lost loved ones throughout this pandemic and we all feel their pain and their grief.\n\n\"It turns out that this particular group are currently in litigation with the government. I will certainly meet them once that litigation is concluded.\"\n\nElkan Abrahamson, a lawyer for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, said it was\"simply not true\"that the group is in litigation with the government. \n\nThe group is considering seeking a judicial review of the decision not to hold an immediate inquiry into the pandemic. \n\n'Save lives'\n\nOn 26 August, it sent the government's legal department a\"letter before action\"calling for a meeting with the PM, which says\"the families wish to resolve these issues without the need to resort to litigation\".\n\nMr Abrahamson said the group had yet to receive a reply to this letter.\n\n\"Even if there was litigation parties are always encouraged to meet in person to try and resolve their differences so I don't really see that as an excuse,\"he added.\n\nIn his letter to the group, Mr Johnson said that because they had instructed solicitors, and were\"engaged in pre-action correspondence\", all further correspondence on the issue\"should pass through the respective legal teams\". \n\n\"I understand that the Government Legal Department will be responding to your most recent letter on this topic within the timeframe you requested,\"he added.\n\nJo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, who lost her dad Stuart to the virus, said:\"It feels like we're the wrong kind of bereaved people - like the prime minister only wants to meet with bereaved people who won't ask difficult questions. \n\n\"There's no legal action happening, so that can't be the reason he's not meeting with us. \n\n\"So will he now commit to meet with us so we can share our experiences of serious issues - from deaths in care homes to inadequate protective equipment - that can help him learn crucial lessons and save lives?\"\n\nCovid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for an independent, judge-led, statutory public inquiry into coronavirus deaths, which it wants to begin imminently.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said earlier that the PM remained committed to meeting people who have been bereaved as a result of Covid-19, and that he was\"resolute in his determination to beat this virus\"to prevent further\"dreadful loss\".\n\nIn July the prime minister committed to an independent inquiry into the pandemic, but has repeatedly said now was not the right time.\n\nWhat could an inquiry look like?\n\nIndependent inquiries can take many forms - from full public inquiries that can take years, or in some cases decades, and cost millions of pounds; to smaller scale, more fleet-footed investigations.\n\nThe idea is to hold the powerful to account and try to learn lessons from decisions that have gone wrong, and how to avoid repeating scandals and tragic events in the future.\n\nRecent examples of judge-led inquiries include the Leveson inquiry into media standards, or the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe.\n\nOther inquiries, such as 2009 Iraq inquiry, headed by a retired senior civil servant Sir John Chilcot, do not take evidence under oath.\n\nThe government of the day is normally expected to adopt many, if not all, of the recommendations of an official inquiry, although it does not always work out like that in practice.\nTL;DR: Boris Johnson says he will meet a group of families bereaved by coronavirus when their \"litigation\" with the government has \"concluded\".\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent\n\nThe 12m Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer has completed a 22-day-long mission to map an area of seafloor in the Atlantic.\n\nSEA-KIT International, which developed the craft,\"skippered\"the entire outing via satellite from its base in Tollesbury in eastern England.\n\nThe mission was part-funded by the European Space Agency.\n\nRobot boats promise a dramatic change in the way we work at sea.\n\nAlready, many of the big survey companies that run traditional crewed vessels have started to invest heavily in the new, remotely operated technologies. Freight companies are also acknowledging the cost advantages that will come from running robot ships.\n\nBut\"over-the-horizon\"control has to show it's practical and safe if it's to gain wide acceptance. Hence, the demonstration from Maxlimer. \n\nThe USV was despatched from Plymouth in late July and sent to a location some 460km (280 miles) to the south-west.\n\nWith a multi-beam echo-sounder attached to its hull, the boat mapped more than 1,000sq km of continental shelf area, down to about a kilometre in depth.\n\nThis was a segment of seafloor that had essentially no modern data registered with the UK Hydrographic Office.\n\nSEA-KIT had wanted to send the USV across the Atlantic to America for the demonstration, but the Covid-19 crisis made this impossible to organise.\n\n\"The project's overall aim was to demonstrate the capabilities of current technologies to survey unexplored or inadequately surveyed ocean frontiers and despite the planning challenges we faced due to Covid-19, I feel that we have done that. We have proven the true over-the-horizon capability of our USV design and the team are exhausted but elated,\"the company's director of technology, Peter Walker, said.\n\nThe USV Maxlimer was originally developed for - and won - the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE.\n\nThis was a competition to find the next-generation technologies that could be used to map the global ocean floor. Four-fifths of the sea bottom have yet to be surveyed to an acceptable resolution. Robotic solutions will be essential if we're to have any chance of closing the knowledge gap.\n\nMaxlimer makes use of a communications and control system known as Global Situational Awareness via Internet.\n\nThis allows an operator to remotely access CCTV footage, thermal imaging and radar through the vessel, as well as listen live to the USV's surroundings and even communicate with others in the vicinity.\n\nMaxlimer links to three independent satellite systems to stay in contact with the control room in Tollesbury.\n\nThe robot boat moves slowly, at up to 4 knots (7km/h; 5mph), but its hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system is highly efficient.\n\nSEA-KIT CEO and designer, Ben Simpson, told BBC News:\"We had a sweepstake on how much fuel would be left in the tank. We thought there was going to be 300-400 litres. It turned out there was 1,300 litres.\"In other words, Maxlimer returned to Plymouth with its fuel tank still around a third full.\n\nAs well as the European Space Agency, partners on the project included Global Marine Group, Map the Gaps, Teledyne CARIS, Woods Hole Group and the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. \n\nAnother partner was Fugro, one of the world's biggest marine geotechnical companies. The multinational recently announced a contract with SEA-KIT to purchase a fleet of USVs to use in survey work in the oil, gas and offshore wind sectors. \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: A UK boat has just provided an impressive demonstration of the future of robotic maritime operations.\n\nArticle: By Gwenfair GriffithBBC Wales News\n\nNow attempting to\"home school\"in a language they don't speak, they face an extra layer of challenge.\n\nIn Cardiff, for example, about 63% of pupils in Welsh-medium schools come from homes where no Welsh is spoken. \n\nOn top of anxiety about coronavirus and general concern about education, some parents are worried their children's Welsh language skills will suffer.\n\nDebbie from Cardiff is one of them. She is learning Welsh, but feels she does not know enough to help her two young sons, Riley, eight, and Harley five, with their school work.\n\n\"I can only help them in English and I'm worried they'll fall behind with their Welsh language skills, compared to the kids who get Welsh at home every day,\"she said.\n\nShe said the boys had been watching a lot of Cyw children's programmes on S4C and playing games on Duolingo and other apps. But she wishes they could do more.\n\nCeri Anwen James, assistant headteacher at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Edern, in Penylan, Cardiff, said:\"We know that the vast majority of our parents don't speak Welsh. \n\n\"When they made the decision, many moons ago, to educate their child through the medium of Welsh, they hardly thought that one day their child would be educated in Welsh from their kitchen or lounge, due to a pandemic lockdown, with them having to navigate the intricacies of a Welsh-medium curriculum.\"\n\nShe said the school had tried to keep tasks as straightforward as possible and given pupils plenty of links and activities to stay in touch with the Welsh language. \n\n\"It's essential that they have as much contact as possible with the Welsh language while they are away from school,\"he said. \n\nTo help parents like Debbie, a number of Welsh-speaking parents and others have come forward to help by developing new content to ensure children can have fun at home, as well as do their school work in Welsh.\n\nUkulele lessons\n\nCardiff-based musician Mei Gwynedd has started ukulele lessons on his YouTube channel every Tuesday and Thursday morning. \n\n\"I think music should be available for everyone,\"he said, adding that he's trying to secure funding to provide subtitles to help non-Welsh speaking families follow along as well.\n\nIllustration\n\nCartoonist Huw Aaron provides daily videos to help kids get creative every weekday on YouTube. He said he was motivated partly by his worry about how the lockdown could affect non-Welsh-speaking families.\n\n\"If there's no fun, interesting content for kids in Welsh, they might not hear the language much at all for.... months?\"\n\n\"I hope that five or 10 minutes of following simple instructions on how to illustrate a monkey or robots might be helpful to families with long empty days ahead of them for who knows how long.\"\n\nKeeping fit\n\nJoe Wicks might be calling himself the UK's PE teacher, but Rae Carpenter from Ffit Cymru on S4C is trying to challenge him. She's doing daily sessions at 09:00 BST.\n\nFor children who prefer to exercise in the afternoon, Lleucu Ifans posts her Facebook videos at 13:00 BST.  \n\n\"If anything positive comes out of this, it's that kids will have sport as part of their daily life,\"she said. \n\n\"I just want to keep everyone moving, not just children.\"\n\nWelsh lessons for families\n\nAran Jones from Say Something in Welsh spotted the need to help parents early on during the coronavirus crisis, and started new daily lessons to help families learn Welsh together called Bedtime Welsh.\n\n\"We have two-minute lessons on the phone, and videos on our YouTube channel. We're keeping it quite short and hope families have fun doing it,\"he said. \n\n\"We have at least 300 involved on our Slack group at the moment. Anyone's free to join in.\"\n\nMr Jones has since started a new venture to help teach the Welsh national anthem by asking famous faces to take part in the video lessons.\n\nS4C and BBC\n\nS4C has gathered all of its educational children's programmes together to create Ysgol Cyw so that parents can be assured their children are watching educational programmes at home.\n\nThe BBC has a variety of educational material available in Welsh too, including Bitesize. From 20 April onwards, a daily service called Bitesize Dyddiol will be available including short films and animations for pupils aged 3-14 years.\nTL;DR: Until a few weeks ago, non-Welsh speaking parents who had chosen Welsh-medium education assumed their children would spend about 30 hours a week immersed in the language - at school.\n\nArticle: The online giant said this was to benefit employees and UK public health.\n\nHowever, analysts said it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector and buff up Amazon's reputation after questions over working conditions.\n\nAmazon recently moved into the online pharmacy business in the US for subscribers to its Prime service.\n\nLab tests\n\nIn 2020, the online retailing giant set up laboratories in Kentucky and in Greater Manchester to process employees' PCR tests.\n\nThe lab in Manchester has processed 900,000 test samples to date.\n\nThe test results are anonymous and will be shared with Public Health England once the lab is approved for sequencing.\n\nIts coronavirus response efforts have so far cost the company $11.5bn (\u00a38.1bn). \n\nTom Forte, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A.

It saved my life.\"\n\nPreviously, Geraldine was a businesswoman but says her mental health deteriorated in her late 30s. She lost two businesses and her house to drug addiction by the time she was 40.\n\nShe has experienced homelessness, spending two years on the streets around Victoria station in London. When she was mugged, she spent six weeks in hospital and then moved to bed and breakfast accommodation, where she spent a further four years. She now lives in north London.\n\nWhile in prison, Geraldine attended an art class and started to paint portraits of nude figures.\"I've always liked the female nude. I've developed my artistic eye and I do more abstract figurative work now.\"\n\nShe submitted a small watercolour painting of a nude to a prison exhibition. Six people wanted to buy the painting.\"That gave me such a buzz when I sold it. At the exhibition the next year I sold two more pieces.\"\n\nGeraldine is now an art mentor for people with mental health difficulties who have been in a hostel or living on the street.\n\nShe also takes a women's group to the Royal Academy of Arts every two months to see an art exhibition.\"There are so few things for women in the homeless arena, I try to give women a voice.\n\n\"I've been diagnosed with PTSD and an anxiety disorder, and I got treatment.\n\n\"But I think a lot of mental health conditions of the homeless go untreated. Many homeless people don't realise that they actually need to see a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.\"\n\nAs a self-employed artist, Geraldine carries out consultancy work for Cafe Art, a social enterprise that aims to empower people affected by homelessness by supporting their art, photography and entrepreneurship.\n\n\"Someone once asked me what my dream would be and I said working with marginalised people and being an artist, [which has] ended up coming around. It's been amazing.\"\n\nGeraldine has submitted a number of paintings to this year's festival, including the image below called Woman with Purple Hair, drawing inspiration from a book of nude photo portraits.\n\nOne Festival of Homeless Arts was founded in 2016 by ex-homeless artist and campaigner David Tovey, seen below with one of his works during the hanging of the exhibition.\n\nArtist Stephen O'Grady submitted three pieces of art to the festival, seen below.\n\nThe ink drawings show different places in which a homeless person may find themselves sleeping: a pavement, on a discarded mattress or in a seaside shelter.\n\n\"I've slept on mattresses I've found so many times,\"Stephen says.\"To someone that's a discarded bit of rubbish, but at that time that was home to me. I'm trying to get that across in the art - that everything has a value to somebody.\"\n\nStephen found himself homeless in late 2015, following several years of alcohol abuse and the breakdown of his marriage.\n\nHe was homeless in Watford, the area in which he grew up, before deciding to travel to the south coast.\"If you're going to be homeless, it's nice to be beside the seaside, so I went to Brighton.\"\n\nThe shelter seen in his work, next to the word Belvedere, is a scene from Brighton seafront.\n\nWhile homeless, Stephen returned to his love of art, which began when he attended Watford School of Art as a teenager.\n\n\"I always drew even when I was on the streets, I'd have my sketchpad and pens in my bag. The output wasn't great.\n\n\"But looking back on some of the art is quite eye-opening. It was a diary, like an outlet.\"\n\nStephen found creative inspiration from the people around him.\"I'm inspired by people's faces, expressions and speed of movement. \n\n\"When you're homeless you've got the freedom to stare a bit more at people, because you are being ignored, plus you've nothing else to look at. Not being looked at really got to me.\"\n\nStephen is now in accommodation in Watford and is nourishing his love of art.\"I like the feeling of opening a box of paints, or my art box, and just attacking a bit of paper.\"\n\nHe recently filled a sketchbook with drawings dedicated to his partner, with every page inspired by her.\"She got a feeling of joy when she was given it, saying,'No-one's ever done anything like that for me, that's amazing.'\"\n\nArtist Claire Bastow first experienced homelessness shortly after she moved to London in the 1980s.\n\n\"The landlord of the accommodation I was in found out that two of my housemates were gay, and so threw all six of us out,\"she says.\"I had to sleep on people's couches. I ended up in a squat for a while. There was no legislation to protect us at that point.\"\n\nLater in life, Claire says she was made homeless again as a result of domestic violence.\n\n\"When I've experienced homelessness it's been pretty awful, that uncertainty. I've had to spend the odd night on the street. Or living on people's couches.\n\n\"I've been able to use some of that experience to inspire me creatively. There've been some positives from it, that's how I've processed it. All that comes out in my art; a sense of belonging, and not belonging.\"\n\nClaire developed her art skills in her late 30s, earning various qualifications, including A-level art. She has fond childhood memories of spending time with her grandfather Basil Bastow, an established watercolour artist who was also president of the Nottingham Arts Council.\n\n\"We used to go to art galleries all the time. We queued up for three hours to see the Turner exhibition. Turner was his main inspiration.\"\n\nClaire has two portraits in the art festival, both paintings of women who have experienced homelessness, Marianne (below left) and Maiya (below right).\n\n\"You can see their stories in the characters of their faces. Marianne is pointing to her eye as though to say,'Look at me, I have a story to tell.'\"\n\n\"When people see my work I hope they get from it the idea that when you first glance at somebody, whoever they are, it's better to look further. Everyone has got a story.\n\n\"Everyone has experienced difficulties in their life. Everyone is valid and has a voice and deserves to be seen and heard, and not hidden away, or stigmatised.\"\n\nFind out more about the One Festival of Homeless Arts.\n\nInterviews and photographs by Matthew Tucker.\nTL;DR: One Festival of Homeless Arts brings together works of visual art, theatre, film and photography, all created by artists who are or have been homeless. \n\n\n\nArticle: News from Elsewhere......media reports from around the world, found by BBC Monitoring\n\nThe move is being considered in the Yamalo-Nenets region of northwest Siberia, as a way to help police maintain law and order in the difficult terrain, the Izvestia newspaper reports.

It was like I was on holiday.\n\nAll the staff were'aunties' and'uncles' and there was so much food and so much fun and lots of other kids.\n\nHonestly, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.\n\nWhat I loved was that every Saturday morning they took us out, to the zoo, to the cinema.\n\nAnd on Sundays we went to Sunday school and came back and had a roast.\n\nYou hear that children's homes are awful places - I always want to say there is another side to that story.\n\nYou don't hear about the people who had a nice time there, but it was a real refuge and sanctuary for me. I was safe.\n\n'I slept in a cell'\n\nI was in Parklands for seven or eight months, then they brought some foster parents to see me who had a daughter and I eventually went to live with them.\n\nI found it really difficult to go from lots of children and a really busy house to just having a room by myself, so I found it really difficult and felt quite isolated and lonely.\n\nI live in a house share now and I don't think it's coincidental. I like house shares, I like people around.\n\nIn my teenage years I started running away a lot. I would go and stay with my sister and brother who were now married and had their own families.\n\nI spent the odd night in children's homes, but they didn't have space for me so I'd be one night here and one night there.\n\nThen they took me to a borstal (a young offenders institution) in Bristol even though I'd never been arrested and I'd never been to court or charged with anything.\n\nIt was in the days of the short, sharp shock treatment, so it was really tough.\n\nIt was a cell where we slept.\n\nI was there for a couple of weeks until social services came to get me. I think someone must have kicked off that I was in a borstal.\n\n'I got to know all the sex workers'\n\nThey put me in a bed and breakfast where I had to share a bed with a woman I'd never met before.\n\nI really liked her. She was only 19 but to me, at 15, she seemed really grown up.\n\nShe was a sex worker. She used to call herself Judy Teen after the Steve Harley song.\n\nShe used to say'I'm going out to work now Hayley' and meet me after work and she would take me to bars.\n\nBut she would never encourage me to do sex work or anything.\n\nIt all kind of went wrong because there was a guy there who threatened me and the police turned up.\n\nSocial services realised they shouldn't have put me there, with these older men who were trying to get us drunk, so they moved me to Emma Place.\n\nIt was a thriving red-light district then and every time I went out - I was 15 then with long blonde hair - I used to get people coming up all the time.\n\nI got to know all the sex workers. I was lucky because I was a babysitter for them.\n\nBut when I look at someone who's on drugs or a sex worker I wonder how didn't I end up like that.\n\n'I met my father for a drink'\n\nI have one daughter who is 37 now.\n\nWhen she was aged five I had a nervous breakdown and they think it was because she had reached the age at which things started to go wrong in my life.\n\nI ended up in an institution [Moorhaven on Dartmoor] for a couple of months.\n\nWhen I was in my 30s I had heard from someone that my father wanted to see us all, so I decided to go and see him.\n\nI spoke to him and we met and had a drink together and I just decided I had nothing in common with him and I didn't like him as a person, and I had no respect for him.\n\nI had managed so long without him I didn't really feel like he would be a positive influence in my life so I just decided not to see him again.\n\n'I empathise with people who've been displaced'\n\nYou may also like:  \n\nI was working in the private sector as a quality assurance manager and when I was 40 I thought'I just don't want to do this - this is not what I want to be doing.'  \n\nI always call it my mid-life crisis.\n\nI gave it all up and went to work voluntarily with refugees.\n\nWhen I was in foster care we had Uganda-Asian refugees living in a centre nearby.\n\nWe collected blankets and jumpers and clothes for the families and I remember thinking they were the most courageous people I had ever seen.\n\nThey had escaped all this horror and here they were making this new life.\n\nI don't think that ever left me about how courageous they were.\n\nAnd I think it's because I just have this empathy with people who have been displaced.\n\nThey don't know when they're going to see their family, they don't know where they're going to end up.\n\n'I was fortunate to have the childhood I had'\n\nI do a lot of work with asylum seekers and refugees and in refugee camps in Iraq.\n\nWhen people grow up in a stable home and they have got this unconditional love, they learn all those things that people take for granted. \n\nSo they grow up and they watch their mother cooking, or they learn about budgeting, or they see them sewing or ironing.\n\nI didn't have a clue how to do any of that.\n\nBut the childhood I had has given me an empathy with people that I think I wouldn't necessarily otherwise have.\n\nI get to work with the most amazing people and they let me into their lives, and that is a massive privilege.\n\nIt also gives you a resilience and strength that you can't learn because no matter how bad something is, it's not permanent. Things do get better.\n\nSo I'm very fortunate to have had the childhood that I had, because no-one can teach you that. You have to really feel it.\n\nIt's given me a real sense of courage and resilience and determination and I'm very lucky to have that.\n\nAs told to Jonathan Morris\nTL;DR: Following her mother's death, Hayley Kemp was left at a children's home by her father, who had told her they were going to the dentist.

I am going to act fast.\"\n\nThe weak hiring in January followed job losses in December, which put an end to a streak of job gains that started in May.\n\nThe Labor Department said on Friday those falls were deeper than originally estimated, with 227,000 jobs cut instead of 140,000 as previously reported.\n\nAnalysts also attributed the fall in the jobless rate to more people giving up on looking work, as roughly 400,00 more people withdrew from the labour force.\n\nHardest hit\n\n\"This is a significantly softer report than expected, at least in terms of payrolls,\"said Ian Shepherdson, of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\"The bottom line here is that the labour market was frozen at the start of the year, and is completely dependent on the pace of reopening, which in turn is contingent on the speed and sustainability of the fall in hospitalizations.\"\n\nTemporary hires accounted for most of January's job gains, while most other industries shed positions.\n\nThe losses have hit low-income, minority and female workers hardest a trend that continued in January.

Some companies even thrived.\n\nThe employment report for January, however, undermines that theory.\n\nSegments of the economy not directly affected by the pandemic aren't doing well. Hiring in industries like transportation and warehousing fell last month. There were also declines in healthcare.\n\nAt January's pace of 49,000 jobs per month, it would take roughly 17 years for the US jobs market to get back to where it was a year ago.\n\nIt's a reminder for those shaping US economic policy that America's jobs crisis is far from over.\nTL;DR: The US economy added just 49,000 jobs in January as the coronavirus pandemic continued to hamper recovery.\n\nArticle: There were schemes that offered a future of sorts to the Ark Royal  - a proposal to sink it and turn it into a diving site off Torbay, a suggestion that it should become a floating casino off Hong Kong and a plan to turn it into a heliport for London.\n\nBut on Monday hundreds of people are expected to gather as the 690ft (210m) ship leaves Portsmouth for the last time.\n\nDecommissioned five years early to save the Ministry of Defence money, it will be towed to the Leyal shipyard near Izmir in Turkey after being sold as part of a \u00a32.9m ($4.4m)  deal.\n\nOnce there it faces an ignoble end as 20,000 tonnes of scrap metal.\n\nGetting it to that stage is a long process.\n\nAnyone bringing an aircraft carrier to Able UK's yard in Hartlepool could expect the work to take 24 months plus planning time.\n\n\"There would be in excess of 300 people employed. It would be a seven day a week operation, working 12 hours a day,\"says managing director Andrew Jacques.\n\nA challenge comparable to the Ark Royal was presented to its workers when the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau arrived early in 2009.\n\nThe first step is to find out what hazardous substances are on board, says Jacques.\n\nIn the Clemenceau's case this included everything from 1,000 tonnes of asbestos to oils and polluted water - factors which led to protests at the decision to scrap it in the UK.\n\nIt is the owners' responsibility to provide the details, after which the breakers' yard draws up a plan. \n\nThe Ministry of Defence says the work to prepare the Ark Royal began soon after it was retired in early 2011.\n\nAll equipment has been removed and\"all potentially hazardous waste, including asbestos, has been permanently removed or, if integral to the ship, has been catalogued in detail so its proper removal can be monitored\". \n\nAt Able UK, ships are grounded in a dry dock.\n\nSeveral vessels would be brought in at the same time as an aircraft carrier to make the most of the workforce and equipment.\n\nEven when a ship is in place, it is some time before it meets its demise.\n\nUp to two months can be spent carrying out a more detailed environmental survey, after which\"windows\"are cut to provide ventilation.\n\nA team of 150 asbestos workers then starts work. Other hazardous materials are also tackled - tanks, for example, are pumped out through holes cut in the side of the ship.\n\nAsbestos is buried in Able UK's on-site landfill, while other contaminants like oil and polluted water are processed at an on-site treatment facility.\n\nThe main part of the cleaning process takes about 12 months but the process continues.\n\n\"Because of the dead spaces and areas that you can't see you have to approach it with care... there will inevitably be voids and double bottomed tanks [with] oils that you couldn't see,\"says Jacques.\n\nA cleaning team continues working even after work to break up the ship starts.\n\nSections of between 50 to 200 tonnes are removed from either end of a ship, using large hydraulic excavators, workers with cutting torches and cranes. A 3D model is used to work out how to safely proceed.\n\n\"If it's opened up it just looks like egg boxes all piled on top of each other - different rooms and compartments,\"says Jacques. \n\nA pair of 150 tonne excavators are then used to transport the pieces to a nearby area where hydraulic shears and gas torches are used to cut them into\"furnace-sized scrap\"of around 5ft by 2ft (1.5m by 60 cm).\n\nIt was 10 months from the time that pieces started\"dropping\"from the Clemenceau to the end of the cutting work. That's about one man hour a tonne, says Jacques.\n\nFrom there, pieces are taken to the steel plant. Along the way re-usable parts of the ship - like pumps and pipes - will have been stripped and sold off.\n\nIn the case of the Clemenceau, 98.2% was reused or recycled, says Jacques.\n\nExactly how a ship is scrapped varies between yards, although many now adhere to the standards set out by the Hong Kong Convention. This was proposed - but is still to be formally adopted - because of environmental and health and safety concerns over practices in some countries, including Bangladesh and Pakistan where ships are scrapped on the beach.\n\nIn the case of the Ark Royal it will first be secured on a slipway, says Robin Townsend of Lloyd's Register, who has worked with Leyal in Turkey.\n\nWork to dismantle it will start at the front, with sections of up to about 20 tonnes removed from the superstructure and upper decks first. For those involved it can be hot and physically demanding work.\n\n\"There are large areas of the ship which can be extremely loud, with overpowering smell of fuels and oil,\"says Townsend.\n\nFor those who work on areas like the oil tanks there is also an assault on the senses,\"with literally gangs of workers wielding hammers so it is like standing inside a huge steel drum\".\n\nAnother of the Royal Navy's carriers, HMS Invincible, was dismantled by Leyal in 2011, a job which took 10 months.\n\nThe firm has also scrapped Type 42 destroyers including HMS Cardiff, HMS Newcastle, HMS Glasgow, HMS Exeter, HMS Southampton and HMS Nottingham.\n\nFor HMS Illustrious, the third and final of the Royal Navy's Invincible Class aircraft carriers, there is a possible reprieve.\n\nDue to retire in 2014 it would provide plenty more metal for Turkey's furnaces, but the MoD hopes to preserve it as a\"lasting tribute to the work of the Invincible Class\".\n\nYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook\nTL;DR: The Royal Navy's former flagship, HMS Ark Royal, is to be towed to a breakers' yard in Turkey.

He was also one of the prosecutors during the Lockerbie bombing trial, which led to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi being convicted in 2001.\n\nMr Yousaf said the former judge would bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the inquiry, which has been tasked with examining the circumstances surrounding Mr Bayoh's death and the events that followed. \n\nThe justice secretary will now meet Lord Bracadale and the Bayoh family over the coming weeks before setting out the full remit of the inquiry. \n\nThe public inquiry was announced after it emerged that no police officers would face prosecution over Mr Bayoh's death. \n\nMr Bayoh's family said they felt\"betrayed\"by the decision not to prosecute the officers involved, who have always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHow did Mr Bayoh die? \n\nOn the day he died, the father-of-two had been at a friend's house in the morning watching a boxing match. He had taken the drugs MDMA and another drug known as Flakka.\n\nThe drugs dramatically altered his behaviour, and he became aggressive with a friend. He later left home with a knife from his kitchen, and neighbours called the police. He had discarded the knife by the time police arrived.\n\nMr Bayoh, who was originally from Sierra Leone but had lived in Scotland since he was 17, was restrained by six officers and lost consciousness. He died at hospital soon, and was found to have suffered 23 injuries. \n\nDays after Mr Bayoh's death, the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) lawyer Peter Watson told the media that\"a petite female police officer was subjected to a violent and unprovoked attack by a very large man who punched, kicked and stamped on her.\"\n\nBut new evidence which was  obtained by the BBC's Disclosure programme, including CCTV footage, cast doubt on some of the officers' accounts of the incident.\nTL;DR: The public inquiry into Sheku Bayoh's death in police custody will be led by a retired senior judge, the justice secretary has said.\n\nArticle: Prominent former staff and interns at the Southern Weekly urged the official to quit after he changed an editorial into a Communist Party tribute.\n\nThey accused him of being\"dictatorial\"in an era of\"growing openness\".\n\nThe row comes as the website of a liberal journal was closed, after it ran an essay urging political reform.\n\nThe influential online magazine, Yanhuang Chunqiu (or China Through the Ages), had called on China's leaders to guarantee constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nCorrespondents say the censorship row is an early test of whether China's new leaders, announced in November, will be open to reforms.\n\n'Crude'\n\nThe row at the Southern Weekly - known for hard-hitting investigations and testing the limits of censorship - erupted after a new year editorial calling for guaranteed constitutional rights was changed at the last minute to one extolling the virtues of the Communist Party.\n\nIn two open letters, 35 prominent former staff and 50 interns at the paper have demanded the resignation of the provincial propaganda chief in Guangdong, Tuo Zhen.\n\nThey said the move amounted to\"crude\"interference. \n\n\"If the media should lose credibility and influence, then how can the ruling party make its voice heard or convince its people?\"a letter on Friday said.\n\nBBCChinese.com editor Zhuang Chen says it is thought to be the first time there has been a direct showdown between newspaper staff and party officials.\n\nOn China's popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, dozens of search terms involving the Southern Weekly controversy are reportedly being filtered.\n\nThere are reports of many users being suspended from the service.\n\nA foreign ministry spokeswoman said China did not censor news.  \n\nWhile state media have been trying to paint the country's new leaders as reform-minded, the authorities have been clamping down on dissent, the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says. \n\nMany reformers argue that without greater freedom of expression and - more grassroots democracy - the Communist Party could face serious unrest or worse, our correspondent adds. \n\nChinese media are supervised by so-called propaganda departments, which often change content to align it with party thinking.\n\nBeijing also uses extensive internet controls, known as the\"Great Firewall of China\", to block access to material considered subversive or pornographic.\nTL;DR: Journalists at a leading Chinese newspaper have called for a propaganda chief to resign, in a rare protest against censorship.\n\nArticle: The Australian-born journalist beat three other candidates to the position in a poll of Green Party members.\n\nThe new leader takes over from Caroline Lucas who was elected as the Greens' first MP in 2010 and remains the most high-profile figure in the party.\n\nMs Lucas stood down to focus on her duties as an MP and\"give other people the opportunity to get well known\".\n\nMs Bennett has worked for a number of publications and is a former editor of Guardian Weekly, which she left to focus on writing and politics.\n\nShe defeated three other candidates - Peter Cranie, Romayne Phoenix and Pippa Bartolotti - in a vote of just over 3,000 English and Welsh Green Party members.\n\n'Economically illiterate'\n\nIn her acceptance speech, she said she was\"deeply honoured\"to be given the responsibility to lead the party and stood because she believed in its\"radical vision\"for Britain's future.\n\n\"It offers, I think, the only viable way forward for British people, for the world.\"\n\nShe said she wanted to see a more localised economy with more UK manufacturing and support for farmers, adding that the financial industry needed to be\"reined in\"to avoid another crash.\n\n\"We need to not have the disastrous, economically illiterate cuts that we're seeing now.

She was shocked, she says, that during the three-month free trial for new subscribers, Apple would not be paying musicians for the songs its users streamed.\"We don't ask you for free iPhones,\"she wrote.\"So why should we give you free music?\"\n\nApple quickly caved. But by then, the spat had reignited an important debate: does streaming reward artists fairly? There are other concerns too. Does it affect the quality and variety of music that's made? And does it change the way we listen? \n\nIn other words: is streaming good for music? Here, four experts give their views to the Inquiry programme.\n\nLucy Rose: It's getting harder to survive in the industry\n\nLucy Rose is a 26-year-old British singer-songwriter. She started by recording songs in her parents' living room.\n\n\"We put a video up and it was only from people sharing that YouTube video that actually anything happened with me. I was unsigned, playing small gigs, but that was a real big break for me.\"\n\nAfter her videos and songs got millions of plays on streaming sites, a record company took her on, and began to promote her, even in countries where she didn't have a physical record out.  \n\n\"We got flown out to do some shows in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and China, and that was only possible because these streaming services were exposing my music to people that probably wouldn't have heard it otherwise.\n\n\"I feel like it's getting harder and harder to survive in the music industry and to get established in any way. Not as many people are buying records as they used to, which makes things a lot harder for us. Because if people don't buy my record... I will get dropped by my label.\"\n\n\"I was interested in the number of streams I got on Spotify and I think it was around five million plays of the entire album from start to finish, in America, which for me was really exciting. But at the same time I didn't see any money from that... so I don't think it's actually made a difference how the company sees me as an artist.\"\n\nSpotify says that for five million individual plays, it pays $25,000. But they don't pay artists directly: instead they pay the artists' labels and publishers who own the music. \n\nChris Carey: A giant opportunity\n\nChris Carey works for Media Insight Consulting, a boutique consultancy focusing on data in the music industry.\n\n\"The reality for music streaming is you are changing the business model. You're going from paying for all your consumption upfront to almost paying as you go, so you get much smaller payments but you get them much more often. So rather than getting paid once for your album you instead get remunerated every time someone listens. \n\n\"There's a tightrope to be walked between valuing the artists appropriately for the work, but also then convincing consumers to pay.\n\n\"There's an argument that says the free service and the premium service are too similar. I think the challenge is to make the premium service even better rather than simply making the free service worse.\n\n\"The pricing would be different if we hadn't gone through the illegal downloading world but I think the fundamental challenge we've got is that music is undervalued as a result of that first step and what we're now doing is playing catch-up, that we're trying to compete with free. \n\n\"If you look at the decline of the recorded music industry, we are a small fraction of where we were 10, 15 years ago. We're now arguing about how we get out of that hole. For people who are innovating in that space, I'd be very happy to defend them. \n\n\"I think it's a giant opportunity if streaming can become a mass-market activity.\"\n\nCarrie Colliton: I connect more with a record \n\nCarrie is a music fan and vinyl obsessive who got her first job in a record store aged 20.\n\n\"I have streaming in my office and I can listen to music all day long and maybe not tell you the next day most of the artists I listen to. But if I'm purposely taking out a record that I own and putting it on, I'm choosing what that is and I'm connecting with it more.\n\n\"I just really like the idea that I'm holding the physical artefact of what the musicians wanted you to have, what they created in their brain, you know. You can listen to it when you want and you can hold it.\n\n\"I was obsessive, like a lot of people, about reading the liner notes and learning about, oh, what does this person do, oh, this person was on the other album too, this other band, they must know each other. \n\n\"I think streaming has turned out to be, and will continue to be, an incredibly effective discovery tool. The fact that you can think of a song or read about an artist and you can go and listen to the music and have this giant listening station at your discretion is fantastic.\"\n\nLars Ulrich: Record companies take fewer chances\n\nLars Ulrich is the drummer with Metallica, the heavy metal band that's sold more than 100 million records.\n\n\"I believe streaming is good for music. I mean the thing that I read a lot is that people sit there and go,'I'm not getting paid very much for streaming.' But there's one major thing that gets overlooked in that argument and the whole thing is that streaming is a choice on all fronts. \n\n\"It's a choice for the fan to be part of, it's a choice for the artists who are involved in making their music available on streaming services. It's a choice by the record companies that represent the artist. Fifteen years ago those choices didn't exist. \n\n\"Streaming probably does benefit artists with higher profiles. And if you listen to the playlists a lot of these playlists that are being made available for people in the streaming service, they seem to feature higher profile artists and that just seems to be the way it's sort of playing out right now.\n\n\"One of the main reasons I connect less with new music in my life now is because there's less great new music to connect with. A lot of the stuff that's been played is just regurgitated, this year's flavour, this thing, but it's not people on the leading edge like the Beatles or the Miles Davises or the Jimi Hendrixes taking us all by the hand into these completely unknown, uncharted musical territories.\n\n\"When there's less people buying music, there's less money generated back and record companies take less chances and instead of promoting 500 records a year, they promote 50 records a year and they don't put the same amount of money into breaking new art. The saddest thing about all of this is that there's less and less money being put into younger artists and there is a danger of younger artists coming close to extinction. \n\n\"Thirty, 40 years ago I would get on my bike, drive to the record store, spend time figuring out which record I could buy by listening to a bunch of them. By the time I got home I would end up spending every minute of my free time for the next week just acting with this particular record.\n\n\"Nowadays music, to an extent, for some people it's become kind of background noise.\"\n\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.

They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. \n\nMore ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi\"no-fly zone\"in Syria, at least for a while. \n\nLast year when the US struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun, the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites.\n\nWhat strategic purpose can be served by this?\n\nIt certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them.  \n\nAnd President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. \n\nSo why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow?\n\nOn its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. \n\nThe first objective is to push back against the increasing\"normalisation\"of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind.\n\nThe taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 has been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it.  \n\nIn 2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a\"red line\", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since.\n\nMany Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts.\n\nBeyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. \n\nThe campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. \n\nOf course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. \n\nThe calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control.\n\nAnd the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory.  \n\nUsing military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy. \n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nProfessor Michael Clarke is a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (Rusi), and associate director of the Strategic Studies Institute. \n\nEdited by Jennifer Clarke.\nTL;DR: As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response to  the suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria , what could military intervention achieve?\n\nArticle: By Matt PreceyBBC East\n\nIn the past three years, the number of such patients kept waiting more than 60 minutes by the East of England Ambulance Trust has more than quadrupled.  \n\nIn an internal email seen by the BBC, staff at the East of England Ambulance Service have called on the trust board to investigate\"the vast numbers of patients that have deteriorated due to the current operational policies of this trust\".\n\nIt is understood a collective grievance has been raised by crews in Peterborough over a policy of getting more of them to work alone using rapid response vehicles in order to meet response time targets. \n\nThey claimed not enough priority is being given to actually transporting patients to hospital in back-up ambulances.\n\nThey also claimed many of these ambulances are being diverted elsewhere, also to meet targets.\n\nThe email, which was sent to ambulance stations across Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk, described how staff had also gained access to the trust's own internal databases.\n\nIt said some staff had presented management with documentary evidence of\"hundreds of patients, many being time critical stroke and PPCI patients, that have had to wait in excess of an hour for transport\".\n\nPPCI is a surgical procedure for treating a heart attack. \n\nThe ambulance trust's own figures, obtained by the BBC, show that in 2010-11, there were 351 occasions where a vehicle called to a patient with a suspected stroke or heart problem took more than an hour to arrive on scene. \n\nThis is up from 72 in 2007-08. \n\nThe trust said the number of such calls it received almost doubled over the same period, to more than 27,000 a year.  \n\nInternal inquiry call\n\nThe email outlining the grievance follows an incident in Peterborough on 26 June in which a 56-year-old woman who suffered a stroke at a restaurant had to wait more than an hour for an ambulance to take her to a hospital just two miles away.  \n\nTheresa Bradshaw's family have confirmed that the vehicle which eventually turned up had travelled from Huntingdon, 20 miles away.  \n\nMrs Bradshaw did not survive, though it is understood that an earlier ambulance may not have saved her. \n\nThe internal email also said staff planned to raise the issue with the Care Quality Commission and MPs, if their call for an internal inquiry was unheeded.\n\nAccording to Department of Health figures for April, the East of England Ambulance Service was the worst performing in mainland England for getting stroke patients to a specialist unit within an hour. \n\nThe ambulance service's figures show that 47% of stroke patients got to a specialist unit within an hour - half as well as the best performing trust in England, though this had climbed to 57% in May.\n\nThe East of England Ambulance Service admitted it became aware of problems with back-up vehicles getting to patients four months ago.\n\nIn a statement, the trust said:\"Demand is now at a record high after a 15% rise in calls in the last three years.\n\n\"It has been therefore necessary to implement more appropriate and effective ways of delivering our service to patients during challenging times.\n\n'Put at risk'\n\n\"We take any delays in back-up very seriously and each case is now automatically flagged and investigated.

This is the second crocodile relative excavated from the Cerrejon mine.\n\nTemperatures at this time were much higher than today, and scientists say that studying the diversity of animals in this ecosystem could help them understand the impacts of a warmer climate in the future.\n\nIt lived alongside a giant snake known as Titanoboa, which is thought to have grown to about 13m (42ft) in length.\n\nThe scientists say that A. guajiraensis was specialised for eating fish, which means it probably would have competed for food with Titanoboa.\n\n\"The younger individuals were definitely not safe from Titanoboa, but the biggest of these species would have been a bit much for the [13m] 42-foot snake to handle,\"said lead author Alex Hastings, from the Florida Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe new species belongs to a group of crocs known as dyrosaurids, believed to be primarily ocean-dwelling, coastal reptiles. \n\nThe researchers say the new adult specimens challenge previous theories that the animals would only have entered freshwater environments as babies before returning to the sea. \n\nThe croc was comparable in size with the largest examples of living crocodiles and alligators today.\nTL;DR: The fossilised remains of 6m (20ft) -long extinct crocodile relatives have been discovered in a mine in Colombia.\n\nArticle: The 33-year-old star took his place alongside graduates for the ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral in the city where he was born.\n\nHe was joined by his fiancee Miranda Kerr, his parents and sister Samantha.\n\nAlso honoured with a degree was fellow actor David Suchet, best known for his title role in the TV adaptation of Agatha Christie's Poirot.\n\nBloom first caught the attention of audiences in Peter Jackson's award-winning Lord Of The Rings trilogy and went on to star in Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nHe said:\"It's a really big deal.

So we tried to find out who was behind the group. They had deleted their Instagram accounts but through the screenshots and some tools, I was able to trace them,\"he said. \n\nMr Singh then passed on the information to the police, which has now led to one teenager being taken into custody.\n\nWhat else has happened?\n\nThe Delhi Women's Commission (DCW) has asked for an investigation into the group. \n\nIt issued a directive to the Delhi police to file a case against the perpetrators and submit a report detailing exactly what action had been taken so far.\n\nPolice say they started their investigations after being made aware of the matter, but have told local media that a school had also filed a criminal complaint over the same case. \n\nThey are likely to bring more members of the group into custody soon, they added.\n\nMeanwhile the DCW has also issued a notice to Instagram, asking for the details and IP addresses of all the members of the group, and asking the social media site to detail exactly what action it has taken to deal with the situation. \n\nIn a statement Instagram said that they did not allow\"behaviour that promotes sexual violence or exploits anyone, especially women and young people\", adding that they had taken action as soon as they were made aware of the group. \n\nPawan Duggal, chairman of the International Commission of Cyber Security Law, says that the social media company has to be more liable. \n\n\"Instagram cannot say they don't know this was happening. They have to cull out such content voluntarily. The police can go after them if they fail,\"he told the BBC, adding that this group was the result of India being\"too soft\"towards intermediaries like social media networks.\n\nWhat causes such behaviour?\n\nMr Duggal says his organisation has noticed a\"massive increase\"in the number of children visiting pornography and other\"dark web\"sites during the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. \n\n\"In the last 40 days of the lockdown, there have been massive sociological and psychological changes in society with children being indoors and not sharing their online activities with parents,\"he said.\n\nHe added that while they don't have scientific data, the commission had observed a rise in this trend - visits to pornography sites and sexual fantasy groups - during the lockdown. \n\nHowever, senior psychologist Dr Roma Kumar, said such groups existed even before the lockdown, but said the unusual situation could make them more prevalent.\n\nMr Duggal said authorities had to send a strong message, and that the law had to\"come up with a very strong hand\"against the members of the group to discourage such behaviour from recurring. \n\nThere has been a lot of outrage and abuse directed at the members of the group already, with many people publicly calling for them to be arrested.\n\nThe names and Instagram handles of the members have also been made public on social media platforms.\n\nHowever, Dr Kumar told the BBC that going after the members of the group in public on the internet was counterproductive and would not solve the issue in the long term. \n\n\"The aim is not to damage them. The aim is to get them out of this kind of behaviour,\"she said, adding that these chats were typical of the kind of high-risk behaviour that children of this age indulged in. \n\n\"The problem also is that with the internet, children are much more exposed to this kind of content, and they think that this is desirable behaviour. The only thing that can help is prolonged counselling so that they can see what they did was wrong,\"she said. \n\n\"Going after them will only make them more angry and defensive, and will not solve the issue.

The Cabinet on Monday agreed in principle that after Brexit EU nationals and people from other parts of the world should face the same immigration rules if they want to come to live or work in the UK. \n\nMinisters discussed proposals at length around the cabinet table and heard a presentation from the chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. \n\nMinisters reached what sources described as a\"high-level conclusion\"that after Brexit people wanting to come to live or work in the UK should be subject to the same rules, wherever they are from. \n\nThere was broad agreement on that principle, and the Home Office will now spend weeks working out further details. But the precise details in a future White Paper might not emerge until after a deal is reached with the EU in November.\n\nOne insider told the BBC that the system would be based on\"skills not nationality\". \n\nAlthough free movement for EU nationals would end, government sources suggest there could still be\"light touch migration\"from the EU as part of a wider trade deal but they say the EU would not get\"something for nothing\"and there would have to be the same access for British citizens in Europe.\n\nThey said that would not be\"preferential treatment\"because other future trade partners, for example the United States, could be offered the same kind of thing. In the Chequers agreement there is provision for a so-called\"mobility partnerships\"with the EU.\n\nIt is understood that the Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the prospect of concerns from business at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than an immediate, shake-up after Brexit.\n\nThe Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely. But sources are adamant that the chancellor did not push for a delay and that there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access. But the cabinet did accept that some sectors would need low-skilled migrants from the EU. \n\nIf there is no deal, insiders have admitted that the new migration system won't be ready and would have to be\"tapered in\".\n\nEU citizens coming to the UK would have to apply for a work visa after they had arrived.

Wales backed Leave.\n\nAcross the UK, 52% voted to leave the EU in last month's referendum.\n\nThe trio have written to Mr Osborne requesting an\"urgent meeting\"to discuss the implications of the EU referendum result. \n\nFollowing the meeting in Cardiff, Mr MacKay said the Scottish government was\"absolutely committed\"to pursuing all avenues to maintain Scotland's place in the EU. \n\nHe added:\"We remain unclear on the likely impact of Brexit on UK government finances, and we are already seeing the UK government suggest changes to future spending plans, as well as considerable concern over the economy and investment levels. \n\n\"The devolved administrations need urgent answers from the UK government on the impact that the Brexit vote could have on future budgets, and that is why it is crucial that we meet with Mr Osborne imminently.\n\n\"I have already expressed concerns about the impact this will have on this year's Scottish budget process, and given this uncertainty, there is a strong case for publishing a one year rather than a three-year budget this year.\"\n\nThe meeting in Cardiff came as Chancellor George Osborne is due to travel to New York, Singapore and China for talks with major investors in the coming weeks.\n\nHe has vowed to create a\"more outward-looking, global-facing Britain\"following the UK vote to leave the European Union.\n\nWriting in the Wall Street Journal, he said even closer economic ties between the UK and US were in the\"overwhelming interest of both countries\".\nTL;DR: Finance ministers from the UK's three devolved administrations have called for an urgent meeting with Chancellor George Osborne.\n\nArticle: The magnitude-6.0 quake struck in the middle of the night, about 35km (22 miles) north of the city of Bologna. \n\nThe tremor caused\"significant damage to the cultural heritage\"of Emilia Romagna region, the government said.\n\nLater on Sunday, a magnitude-5.1 aftershock hit the region, causing more buildings to collapse. \n\nThe aftershock destroyed a clock tower and made a firefighter fall from a wall in the town of Finale Emilia, near the epicentre of the first tremor. \n\nSunday's quake was the worst to hit the country since the L'Aquila tremor killed nearly 300 people in central Italy in 2009.\n\n'Big bang'\n\nThe earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 10km just after 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT).\n\nIt was felt across a large swathe of northern Italy, including the cities of Bologna, Ferrara, Verona and Mantua and as far away as Milan and Venice.\n\nThe tremor forced many terrified residents into the streets.\n\nTwo people were killed in Sant'Agostino when a ceramics factory collapsed. \n\nThe mother of one of the victims told local media that\"he wasn't supposed to be there.

I can't see a circumstance where I think it would be better for Scotland to leave the UK.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives claimed that the special conference was a sign that Labour was preparing for a\"painful surrender to the SNP\"over independence which it said would be a\"betrayal\"of those who voted No in the referendum in 2014.\nTL;DR: Scottish Labour could hold a special conference in the spring to decide whether to change its stance on a second independence referendum.\n\nArticle: By Raj Kaur BilkhuAsian Network reporter\n\nHetal Lakhani from Dallas, USA, started an online petition against the option, which led to the company removing it.\n\nShe started it after speaking to another user, who questioned the filter in light of anti-racism protests. \n\nShaadi.com says the filter\"was not serving any purpose\"and was a\"product debris we missed removing\".\n\nWhen users joined the site they were asked to select how dark or light their skin is under the'skin tone' option.\n\nUsers could search for potential partners by the skin tone they'd selected, but Shaadi.com claims this filter didn't work and searches would show all matches of all skin tones.\n\nThe website is unique to other dating sites because it replaces south Asian tradition of a matchmaker and helps people intending to get married find a spouse.\n\nMeghan Nagpal was using the website to find a potential life partner who would also be of Indian origin.\n\n\"I emailed them (shaadi.com) and one representative said this is a filter required by most parents,\"she tells BBC Asian Network.\n\nShe discussed the complexion filter on a Facebook group, where Hetal is also a member.\n\n'I was really shocked'\n\n\"When Meghan shared this on our group I was really shocked because a company usually has a social responsibility,\"says Hetal.\n\n\"I wanted to tackle this in a way that could make a difference so I started a petition.\n\n\"And it just took off like wildfire.

Theresa May has also made it plain that tax rises are on the table.\n\nBut what she won't do yet is tell us who will pay, or even rule out any particular taxes going up, down or being frozen to find the money.\n\nBe clear, the political decision to find the money has been made. It is even more political to decide from where. And this moment is not just about the NHS, it's about the era when the Tories' priority was paying down the deficit above all else coming to an end.\n\nOpposition politicians are rightly pushing for more detail. But this political shift is also awkward for Labour, as the amount promised is more than Labour had proposed during the election - advocating tax rises themselves, it's not clear where else the party can go.\n\nIt is also the moment when Theresa May seems rather boldly to be willing to try to pull off a rhetorical accounting trick. She repeated her suggestion today that the money for the NHS will come, in part, from the so called\"Brexit dividend\".\n\n\u00a3350m row\n\nThat is a matter of political presentation, not reality. Yes, after we leave the European Union and complete the transition period (leaving the departure lounge) it is true that we will no longer pay what's basically a membership subscription of \u00a39bn a year.\n\nBut what Number 10 and especially the Treasury know very well is that as things stand official forecasts suggest that the economy, the overall amount of cash available for the government to spend, will be smaller than if we had stayed in.\n\nIn the most simple terms, Whitehall number-crunchers predict we will lose more cash wise than we will gain. Now, economic forecasts are often and thoroughly shown to be wrong. But right now, to suggest somehow that Brexit will partly pay for the NHS is at best extremely uncertain, at worst, downright misleading.\n\nRemember this though. The Vote Leave campaign repeatedly used a real figure of \u00a3350m that they knew gave only part of the picture about the costs of leaving the EU.\n\nThat drove the Remain side, and plenty of voters, crazy - and there is still anger about it now. But they knew also that every time the other side complained about it, their claims about the NHS were heard by more people.\n\nIs Theresa May doing the same? Whether it is designed to cause controversy, or just give her Brexiteer ministers something rhetorical to applaud, she is certainly taking flak. It is one thing for a campaign group to put a pretty slippery gloss on statistics, and that caused enough outrage.\n\nIt's quite another for the whole machinery of government to do the same.\nTL;DR: \"There is no magic money tree.\" That's what the prime minister used to say.\n\nArticle: It has accepted the advice of a new review looking at harm reported by women who received the treatment for stress urinary incontinence.\n\nThe review's chair, Baroness Julia Cumberlege, said she was\"appalled at the seriousness and scale of the tragic stories\"that her team had heard. \n\nMany women say the implants caused them agony by cutting into tissue.\n\nSome say they have been left with life-changing injuries.\n\nClaire Cooper, who had the implants, mistakenly had a hysterectomy after doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing her pain.

If it's not what the world expects, if it's statecraft as we've never seen it before, that's because this is a president unlike any the American people have elected before.\n\nFrom\"fire and fury\"to a relationship\"as good as it's been in a long time\". The summit is on, then it's off, now it's on again. The president, as witnessed by his impromptu 16 minute question-and-answer session with gathered reporters, is basking in the world's spotlight as he conducts these historic negotiations. \n\nPassing legislation is hard. Coping with the Russia investigation is infuriating. Welcoming to the White House the\"second most powerful man in North Korea\", as Mr Trump called Kim Yong-chol, is comparatively easy.\n\nEven as Mr Trump heralded the progress being made, he was downplaying expectations for the upcoming summit, which he said was never planned to end in some grand signing ceremony. \n\nFor the moment, it appears the Singapore meeting will be only a first step - a chance for a historic photo-op and a hope for breakthroughs to come. \n\nFor a president who many thought last year was barrelling toward war, however, that appears more than enough.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nNorth Korea has carried out six nuclear tests and numerous tests of ballistic missiles, all the while maintaining a barrage of belligerent rhetoric against its enemies, particularly the US.\n\nIt claims to have developed a nuclear weapon small enough to be carried by a long-range missile, although this remains unverified.\n\nPrevious attempts to negotiate with North Korea have failed, but earlier this year Pyongyang held direct talks with Seoul and the two Korean leaders held a historic summit in April.\n\nWith relations thawing, the US has pledged to help rebuild North Korea's economy if it agrees to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nBut the US wants denuclearisation first and it is unclear whether Mr Kim will agree to fully abandon his nuclear arsenal.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.\n\nTimeline\n\nHow Trump and Kim have changed their tone\n\nShare this timeline\nTL;DR: Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore on 12 June is back on, the US president says, a week after it was scrapped.\n\nArticle: Lakshmi Mittal, owner of ArcelorMittal, who held the top slot in 2008 with \u00a327.7bn now has a fortune of \u00a37.12bn and is number 11 on this year's list.  \n\nThe number of London billionaires fell for the first time since the financial crash - from 80 in 2015 to 77.\n\nThere are also a record 125 women on this year's top 1,000 list. \n\nAt the top of the 2016 guide to Britain and Ireland's richest people are property tycoons the Reuben brothers, owners of London's Millbank Tower and the John Lewis headquarters, who have a fortune of \u00a313.1bn.\n\nMumbai-born David and Simon Reuben, who also own London Oxford Airport and London Heliport, have increased their fortune by \u00a33.4bn in the past year.\n\nOthers on the list include:\n\nMaking it onto the Rich List at all requires at least \u00a3103m.\n\nBrothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Hinduja Group, remain in second place a year on with an unchanged fortune of \u00a313bn.\n\nCompleting the top three is Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik, who has \u00a311.59bn.

Some are re-tested every three months and others up to two years later.\n\nUnder the government's change, those who are deemed unfit for work and with conditions that will not improve will no longer face re-testing.\n\nConditions such as severe Huntington's, autism or a congenital heart condition are among those that are likely to qualify for continuous payments without reassessment. The criteria will be drawn up with health professionals.\n\nMr Green said a\"key part\"of making sure those who were unable to work received\"full and proper support\"included\"sweeping away any unnecessary stress and bureaucracy\".\n\nThe measure will be formally unveiled at the four-day Conservative Party conference, which begins in Birmingham on Sunday.\n\n'Financial security at risk'\n\nAndrew Grantham has claimed ESA for seven years and told the BBC having to be reassessed was frustrating and annoying.\n\n\"I've had MS since 2006... it's chronic, fluctuating and the only guaranteed thing about it is that it will get worse.\n\n\"I've had three assessments and I will have one next year. The first time, I was found fit for work and I had to go to a tribunal.\n\n\"The other two assessments, I had some really good medical evidence from my dedicated nurse and I was found not fit for work.\n\n\"These assessments are stressful for people because they don't know which way it is going to go. There is also a chance that you lose your financial security and you are told that you are fit for work and you have to look for work.\"\n\nMr Green told the BBC:\"If you have got a condition that has made you unfit for work and which can only stay the same or get worse, I think it is just pointless... to just bring someone back again.\n\n\"It's the severity of the condition that matters, because indeed there are some people with MS... that can work, but we know that it's a degenerative disease so there will come a point when it may well be that they can't work.\n\n\"After that it seems to me that re-testing and reassessing them doesn't do them any good - it might induce anxiety and stress in them - and it is also not doing the system any good because it is pointless.\"\n\nCurrently, those in the\"work-related activity group\"- deemed unable to work at the moment but capable of making some effort to find employment -

Chris Huhne went for the PM and the chancellor over AV.\"\n\nThe BBC's deputy political editor James Landale said that the chancellor had intervened, telling Mr Huhne:\"This is the cabinet, not some kind of sub-Jeremy Paxman interview\".\n\n'Deliberate stunt'\n\nOther sources, James Landale added, suggested Mr Huhne's actions felt like a\"deliberate stunt by the Yes campaign\"and that he had not been supported by anyone else in the cabinet.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman confirmed AV\"was raised in the context of parliamentary business\"at the start of the meeting.\n\nAsked about the confrontation, Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he would not give\"a running commentary of what was said in one cabinet meeting\"but told the BBC it was no secret\"that I feel and other people from the Liberal Democrats\"felt the No campaign had been\"quite misleading\".\n\nIt follows an interview with the Guardian on Monday in which Lib Dem minister Mr Huhne accused the Conservatives of\"trashing\"his party and Mr Cameron of doing nothing to stop personal attacks on Mr Clegg by the No campaign.\n\nMr Huhne, a former Lib Dem leadership contender, has been one of the most vocal Lib Dem critics of the No campaign's tactics  - threatening legal action and comparing claims made by cabinet colleague Baroness Warsi to Nazi propaganda.\n\nBut a spokesman for the energy secretary accused Conservatives of\"furiously\"briefing about the meeting despite a convention that the proceedings remained private.\n\nEx-Labour minister Lord Boateng decided against criticising Mr Huhne by name in his speech to a No to AV rally, after a pre-released extracts suggested he would, as the No campaign seeks to move the debate away from a row between politicians. \n\nEarlier Mr Cameron distanced himself from the official No to AV campaign's controversial posters which used images of a sick baby and suggested the cost of introducing an AV system could be up to \u00a3250m - something the Yes camp disputes.\n\n'Foregone conclusion'\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today's programme he was\"directly responsible\"only for the official Conservative Party no campaign but he stood by the No campaign's claims AV would\"very likely\"mean electronic counting machines would have to be bought.\n\nAmid opinion polls suggestions that the Yes campaign is heading for defeat, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he did not accept that the AV result was a\"foregone conclusion\"- adding:\"Let's see what happens on Thursday.\"\n\nHe also defended his decision to refuse to share a Yes campaign platform with Nick Clegg due to his perceived unpopularity with voters:\"There's a reason the No campaign want to make Nick Clegg the poster child for their campaign.\"\n\nThe Yes campaign is trailing in the opinion polls, with a survey by The Sunday Times/YouGov putting them 10 points behind - a narrowing of the poll before that, which put them 18 points behind.\n\nBut campaigners for changing the electoral system insist it is still all to play for, with turnout in different parts of the country likely to prove crucial.\n\nThe No campaign also believes turnout will be all-important. A spokesman said:\"At this stage no one can be certain what the turnout is going to be like and it is about getting out your vote.\"\nTL;DR: Chris Huhne is said to have confronted the prime minister at a cabinet meeting over the No campaign's claims in the alternative vote referendum.\n\nArticle: Zack Davies, 26, from Mold, Flintshire, followed Dr Sarandev Bhambra into Tesco in the town and carried out a\"brutal and unprovoked attack\".\n\nMold Crown Court heard the trainee dentist's hand was almost severed from his arm.\n\nMr Davies denies attempted murder but admits wounding with intent.  \n\nThe jury was told Dr Bhambra was walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when he felt a\"huge blow\"from the 30cm blade to the back of his head.\n\nHe tried escape but Mr Davies attacked him again.\n\nDr Bhambra suffered severe and life-changing injuries, the court was told.\n\nHe said former soldier Peter Michael Fuller saved his life when he intervened during the attack.\n\nMr Fuller told the court he saw an Asian man crouched down on his knees while another man hit him with a machete.\n\nThe pair ran towards him and, as the attacker approached, Mr Fuller said he stood in the middle of the aisle, put his hands up and shouted:\"Stop, this is madness, I am ex-forces.\"\n\nMr Fuller said the man's demeanour changed and he started to engage with him.\n\nHe put the weapons down and the pair spoke until the police arrived.\n\nMr Fuller described the attack as one of the worst incidents of violence he has ever seen.\n\nSion ap Mihangel, prosecuting, said Mr Davies identified Dr Bhambra because of his race and his\"Asian appearance\".\n\nHe told the court:\"This attack was racially motivated... as the attack was taking place he was shouting words such as'white power','this is revenge' and'this is for Lee Rigby'.\"\n\nMr Davies told police it was\"a moment of madness\"and he never intended to kill Dr Bhambra.\n\nHe said he heard voices telling him to follow and attack the victim.\n\nDr Bhambra said, had he lost consciousness, Mr Davies would have\"hacked me to pieces\".\n\nFusilier Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013. \n\nTwo men, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking the soldier to death.\n\nThe court heard items associated with white supremacy and Nazism were found at the defendant's home, including banners, swastika badges and Combat 18 stickers.\n\nMr Davies told police he was a member of a far-right organisation, but had acted alone at the supermarket.\n\nThe jury was told Mr Davies was expelled from school at the age of 11 or 12 after taking a knife onto the premises to attack a classmate.\n\nThe trial continues.\nTL;DR: A man was attacked with a hammer and 12in machete in a racially-motivated revenge assault for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, a court has heard.\n\nArticle: Mr Sisi is due to stand down in 2022 when his second four-year term ends.\n\nBut 485 of the country's 596 lawmakers voted on Thursday to lengthen presidential terms to six years and let Mr al-Sisi serve another two.\n\nSeveral Egyptian human rights groups have spoken out against the decision.\n\nThe changes, first proposed earlier this month, will now be drafted into legislation and put to another parliamentary vote. If approved again, Egypt will then hold a referendum.\n\nWhat are the changes?\n\nArticle 140 of Egypt's constitution, approved in a referendum in 2014, currently states that the president serves four-year terms and may only be re-elected once.\n\nBut under proposed changes, the 64-year-old leader would be allowed to stay in power until 2034.\n\nHe would also get new powers to appoint judges and the public prosecutor.\n\nThe changes would also give Egypt's military broad powers to\"[safeguard] the constitution.\"\n\nOther amendments included the introduction of a second parliamentary chamber, a 25% quota for women in parliament and\"appropriate representation\"for minority Coptic Christians, young people and those with disabilities.\n\nHow are people reacting?\n\nPresident Sisi's supporters in parliament argue the longer term limits are needed to allow him more time to complete economic reforms and development projects. \n\nBut his critics fear it is an attempt to further entrench his rule in the country.\n\nEleven Egyptian human rights groups, in a joint statement, said the provisions were\"disingenuous attempts to sugarcoat [the government's] authoritarian power-grab\".\n\nSignatories include the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies and the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms.\n\nLawmakers have also spoken out against the vote.\n\n\"We are placing absolute powers in the hands of one person... at a time when the people were expecting us to give them'bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity',\"Ahmed Tantawi, an opposition MP, said on Wednesday, using the slogan of the 2011 uprising that overthrew then-President Hosni Mubarak.\n\nMr Sisi, a former army chief, led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013 following protests against his rule.\n\nSince then, he has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, leading to the detention of tens of thousands of people. Mr Sisi recently denied detaining any political prisoners.\n\nThe president has also led a military campaign against Islamic State militants in the country's Sinai Peninsula.\n\nHe was re-elected last April after winning 97% of the vote, facing no serious competition because several rivals dropped out or were arrested.\nTL;DR: Egypt's parliament has overwhelmingly voted to approve draft constitutional changes that could extend President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi's time in office by another 12 years.\n\nArticle: Giant books will be projected onto the facade and whenever a book is chosen from a carousel below, it will appear on the walls with its own animation.\n\nThe display takes place on 16 and 17 May and the library, which was shut for two years, opens on 17 May.\n\nA month-long literary festival is also being held in celebration.\n\nThe In Other Words festival, which starts with a World Book Night event on 23 April, will include shows from broadcaster Lord Bragg and journalist Janet Street-Porter.\n\n'Sense of wonder'\n\nAs part of the digital light display, a carousel containing copies of the books shown on the wall will be placed outside the library.\n\nWhen members of the public pick a book it will come to life on the wall - for example if Alice in Wonderland is selected, Alice will be seen leaping from window to window, peering into the newly refurbished building.\n\nThe show runs from 21:15 until 22:00 BST on May 16, and from 21:15 BST until midnight on May 17.\n\nLiverpool City Council's cabinet member for culture and tourism, Councillor Wendy Simon, said the event is\"a fantastic way to mark this cultural gem's new lease of life\".  \n\nShe added:\"There is a huge amount of anticipation around the re-opening of Central Library and we want to make it a special event.\"\n\nRob Vale, from digital projection experts Illuminos, said:\"Through the projection artwork we're hoping to bring the building to life, to catch some of that sense of wonder that we can all experience when we open a book and our imaginations run wild.\"\nTL;DR: Liverpool's Central Library building will be lit up with an interactive digital display to celebrate its re-opening after a \u00a350m refurbishment.\n\nArticle: The Glasgow-based company saw revenues climb by 29% to \u00a355.6m in the year to the end of March, with its hosting business growing by 40% to \u00a344.7m.\n\nAdjusted pre-tax profit rose by 37% to \u00a314.6m.\n\nIomart said it was well placed to deliver a wider range of cloud services to its customer base. \n\nDuring the year, Iomart increased its European footprint and dedicated server expertise by buying Hampshire-based Redstation for a maximum consideration of \u00a38.1m.\n\n'Long-term opportunity'\n\nIt also acquired a major presence in the cloud backup and disaster recovery market through the acquisition of Backup Technology Holdings for \u00a323m. \n\nThe company also confirmed it had completed the fit-out of about 600 racks of data centre space in Maidenhead, Berkshire.\n\nIomart now owns and operates data storage centres in eight locations throughout the UK, including Glasgow, London, Manchester and Nottingham.\n\nChief executive Angus MacSween said:\"We continue to believe in the long-term opportunity for Iomart as IT spending moves towards the'cloud', as networks and connectivity expand and mobility increases.\"\nTL;DR: Cloud computing firm Iomart has reported a surge in revenues and profits, driven by organic growth and the impact of acquisitions.\n\nArticle: It says it will only allow promotion of foodstuffs meeting national guidelines\n.\n        \n\nFederal standards promote fruit and vegetables and call for limiting calories, fat, salt and sugar.\n\nDisney, whose programmes are broadcast on its own channels and website as well as on the network giant ABC, says the move makes it the first major media company to introduce such standards.\n\nCertain advertisers whose children's menus are currently being promoted on Disney outlets would not meet the new guidelines, although Disney would not say which companies would fail.\n\nDisney will be assessing the restaurant's broader offerings in deciding whether to approve a campaign.\n\nUS First Lady Michelle Obama has backed the plan, calling it a\"game changer\".\n\nShe said in a statement:\"With this new initiative, Disney is doing what no major media company has ever done before in the US - and what I hope every company will do going forward.\"\n\nMrs Obama's Let's Move initiative campaigns to reduce childhood obesity rates, which have tripled over the past 30 years. \n\nContracts\n\nThe new rules cover food and beverage products advertised, sponsored, or promoted on Disney Channel, Disney XD, Disney Junior, Radio Disney, and Disney-owned online destinations aimed at families with younger children.\n\nThey will not apply fully until 2015 because of existing contracts with advertisers.\n\nRobert Iger, chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Corporation, said:\"The emotional connection kids have to our characters and stories gives us a unique opportunity to continue to inspire and encourage them to lead healthier lives.\"\n\nDisney introduced its first set of nutritional standards in 2006.\nTL;DR: Disney says it has set new standards for food advertising on children's outlets banning junk food promotions.\n\nArticle: By Will Dahlgreen & Colletta SmithBBC News\n\nGoogle uses the term\"racy\"to describe skimpy or sheer clothing, strategically covered nudity or provocative poses.\n\nOne of the companies analysed, Missguided, said its site reflected what appealed to its customers.\n\nThe findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned adverts from Missguided and Boohoo.\n\nThe ASA said the Missguided advert featured\"highly sexualised\"images and\"objectified women\", while it told Boohoo to make sure its advertising was\"socially responsible\".\n\nThe BBC's research found that on a typical UK High Street fashion retailer's website, 8% of women's modelling images were\"racy\", compared with 16% for online-only sites.\n\nThe online-only sites analysed were: I Saw it First (21% of images were\"racy\"), Asos (7%), Missguided (16%), Boohoo (16%), Pretty Little Thing (22%) and Nasty Gal (11%). \n\nMore traditional retailers covered were: Topshop (9%), River Island (7%), New Look (4%) and Urban Outfitters (25%). \n\nMissguided said:\"Our website reflects what appeals to the young women who love to buy from us  - sassy, empowered, unafraid of what others think.\n\n\"We run our website for them, not an artificial intelligence algorithm.\"\n\nThe images analysed were posted in the\"new in\"sections of retailers' websites. \n\nSeven of the companies analysed also had men's sites. Of the 6,200 images gathered from these, only 2% were classed as\"racy\". \n\nSocial influencers\n\nOnline-only sites may have racier content because they use social influencers to promote their clothes, suggests Lexie Carbone, who works for Later - a US company which advises businesses on how best to use the photo-sharing app Instagram.\n\nShe says brands invite influencers to formal photo shoots, and these produce a different kind of picture, more reflective of different body shapes and skin-tones, but also potentially in more provocative poses.\n\n\"For the audience to be able to look at that influencer and imagine themselves in that outfit and kind of aspire to be living that life, it's really captured in a different way than maybe a still traditional model pose.\"\n\nClothing design\n\nMartha Poole, managing director of the Manchester-based modelling agency Industry, thinks the main reason for the difference is the design of the clothes. \n\n\"In a dress that's slashed from the neck to the navel, you don't really have to stand provocatively, the dress itself is provocative,\"she said.\n\nHowever, Martha agrees there is a big difference in the appearance of influencers and the'traditional' model which her firm represents. \n\nShe says that unlike many influencers, her models don't have any visible physical enhancements such as fillers, as she wants her male and female models to look classically beautiful.\"They have to be a certain height, have beautiful skin\u2026 and that hasn't changed since the 1940s\".\n\nShopper reaction\n\nNatalie Aitchison, 24, David Poucher, 19, Rhys Blanchard, 20, and Rebecca McGrath, 21, are all students at Salford University.\n\nThey were given two different sets of photos - one batch from online-only sites, and one from High Street sites. The students had no difficulty telling the difference. \n\nNatalie said the online-only models\"just look like Instagram influencers, with the sleek long hair, and the style of the dresses - it's just very night out and looks like thin material, like skimpy material, off-the-shoulder. I can just tell.\"\n\nRebecca said:\"It is more sexy\u2026 these will probably all be thong style [the swimwear], you can just tell by looking at them.\"\n\nRhys said he could spot the High Street styles.\"The dresses look much better quality, looking at the material and looking at the cuts of the dresses\u2026 The fast fashion ones look cheap.\"\n\nBut he also thought there was a big difference in the way the online-only models were posing:\"It's almost a little bit inviting, I think it's more provocative.\"\n\nDavid said:\"When you have people posting stuff on Instagram, they use a lot of filters and highlighter is used to accentuate different features, so like breasts and thighs, so I think that adds to them looking more provocative.\"\n\n'It works!'\n\nBut all the students agree the racier images aren't necessarily a bad thing, because online-only fashion sites are more likely to use models of different body shapes.\n\n\"I buy it, so it works!\"Natalie laughs.\"It is empowering because you can feel sexy, whatever your body type, and that is the message being brought out to younger girls and it works. I know that I'd buy it.\" \n\nDr Antonis Kousoulis, Mental Health Foundation director for England and Wales, said:\"The trouble with fashion advertising is that it is ubiquitous, it uses models who represent a very narrow stereotype of'beauty' and it often targets young women.\"\n\nHe added:\"Fashion imagery can make many people feel worse about their bodies and themselves.\"\n\nA Government Equalities Office spokesperson acknowledged there was pressure on young people to achieve an idealised image which could affect their mental health.\"We want all people to grow up feeling comfortable and confident about their bodies,\"they said.\n\nWhat is'racy'?\n\nGoogle's software scores images from one to five in terms of how likely they are to be, what they call,\"racy\".\n\nIt is part of their\"Safe Search\"tool, which detects adult, spoof, medical, violent and\"racy\"images.\n\nThe BBC's analysis only counted images with a score of four ('likely racy') or five ('very likely racy') as\"racy\". For comparison, the average picture in lads magazine FHM's\"100 Sexiest Women\"2005 edition had a\"racy\"score of four.\n\nWhile having more underwear or swimwear on a site will affect the score, the score is also influenced by the way in which the clothing is modelled.  \n\nHow were the images analysed?\n\nThe BBC's analysis looked at 18,000 images containing a female model from the\"new in\"sections of 10 fashion sites, posted in June to July 2019. \n\nThe sites were chosen because they are popular with women aged 18-24, according to internet research company SimilarWeb. Six were online-only and four were High Street stores.\n\nTwo other High Street brands, H&M and Zara, were left out of the analysis because the BBC was unable to gather images from their websites in a comparable way. \n\nOnly Missguided chose to comment on the BBC's findings.\nTL;DR: Online fashion stores are more likely than traditional retailers to use images described as \"racy\" by a Google tool, BBC research finds.\n\nArticle: Oxfam confirmed that 1,270 direct debit payments were stopped across Saturday, Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe number is far above the average cancellation rate of 600 per month.\n\nThe charity is at the centre of allegations that staff working for Oxfam in Haiti and other countries paid vulnerable people for sex.\n\nA spokesperson for Oxfam said:\"We are grateful for the support of people during this difficult time for Oxfam, some of whom have expressed that they are deeply saddened by the repercussions of the appalling actions of a few - they are determined that the millions of people that Oxfam helps worldwide don't suffer as a result.\"\n\nOxfam said it had received 78 single gifts on Tuesday, the highest number since 1 January. \n\nThe actress Minnie Driver has stood down as an ambassador for Oxfam.

Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

He didn't think for a moment that Theresa May would stand in his way.\n\nToday she proved him wrong and it left him little cover. The mayor insists he'll keep the cannon, so they could still be used in an emergency, but it's not convincing many people.\n\nOpponents have weighed in from all sides about him spending just under \u00a3220,000 on three ageing machines. \n\nFor a mayor, who's claimed to have put careful financial stewardship at the heart of his City Hall tenure, it's a particular blow. \n\nFinally, the home secretary said she was concerned about the\"potential impact of water cannon on public perceptions of police legitimacy\", and cited warnings from chief constables that they could be\"entirely counterproductive\"in areas which already had a strained relationship with the authorities.\n\n\"The country has a proud history of policing by consent and this is a decision which goes to its very heart,\"Mrs May added.\n\n'Outbreak of violence'\n\nMr Johnson told the BBC he believed it was\"the wrong decision\", as the police themselves had told him after the 2011 riots that they wanted to use water cannon as\"an intermediate means of crowd control\".\n\nResponding to the announcement in the Commons, the mayor said the decision to buy the water cannon had been taken\"with the strong support\"of the prime minister, the commissioner of the Met Police and\"the people of London\". \n\nHe asked whether, in the event of\"a serious outbreak of violence that posed a threat to life and limb and property\", the matter could be re-examined.\n\nMrs May said it was always possible for the police to make an application for the use of a new non-lethal weapon, and if so, a proper process would be undertaken and a decision made by the home secretary.\n\nIn a statement, the Met Police said:\"We believed allowing police the option of deploying water cannon, even though they would be seldom seen and rarely, if ever, used, was a sensible precaution which would allow us to deal with a number of specific public disorder situations more safely and effectively than we are currently able.\"\n\nTwo former Conservative policing ministers also criticised the decision.  \n\nDamian Green called it\"regrettable\", while Nick Herbert said he had\"grave concerns\", adding:\"Surely a riot is a riot whether it's in Northern Ireland or on the streets of London.\"\n\nBut SNP justice and home affairs spokesman, Joanna Cherry, said Scottish ministers would also not allow the use of water cannon.\n\nShe said they were disproportionate, indiscriminate and\"cut across the traditional approach of policing in Great Britain\".\n\nMr Johnson said the Met Police would continue to train on the

Our small developing country can now stand head to head with the Taj Mahal, the Grand Canyon and the Pyramids of Giza. \n\n\"For tourism purposes, it's a marketing tool you can't pay for.\"\n\nProtecting Britain's assets\n\nMr Murphy said the rigorous application process included detailed definitions of every structure, along with comprehensive management and conservation plans for the sprawling area which also includes several adjacent archaeological sites.\n\nHe explained that construction at the dockyard began as early as the 1720s but its strategic importance increased after Britain lost the American War of Independence. \n\nSuddenly it had two new enemies in the United States and its ally, France. \n\n\"Sugar from the Caribbean was funding the Industrial Revolution and the development of Britain. With warships sailing around the region, Britain had to protect her assets and keep her ships safe too in a place where they could be properly serviced and cleaned,\"Mr Murphy said.\n\nThe deep narrow bays of Antigua's south coast, surrounded by highlands, create natural harbours offering shelter from hurricanes. \n\n\"No other island has that,\"Mr Murphy said. \n\n\"Britain had a huge military advantage as it was able to keep its fleet there during hurricane season while every other country had to send theirs back home.\"\n\nStrategic location\n\nAntigua's geographical location, at the gateway to the Caribbean, also offered control over the major sailing routes to and from the rich island colonies.\n\nIt was a year after the War of Independence ended that the dockyard would receive its most illustrious resident. \n\nA reluctant Nelson was sent by Britain to enforce the Navigation Act which barred foreign ships from trading with British colonies and made him hugely unpopular with local merchants who depended on trade with the fledgling United States.\n\nNelson is said to have spent much of his three years there in the cramped quarters of his ship, the 125ft (38m) frigate Boreas, declaring Antigua to be an\"infernal hole\"and lamenting in letters back home of melancholy and mosquitoes.\n\nThese days, the dockyard is a vibrant vestige of the island's colonial legacy thanks to the major restoration programme. \n\nIt features original sail loft pillars and numerous buildings such as the 1789 Copper and Lumber Store, now a hotel by the same name, the former Naval Officer's house, now a museum, officers' quarters, guard station and even a small bakery dating back to 1772 which still contains three ovens that once supplied the compound with fresh bread. \n\nAlso included under the Unesco designation are various fortifications which were constructed to protect the area from invaders.\n\nAmong them is Shirley Heights Lookout, a favourite tourist haunt on account of its spectacular panoramic views. \n\nGalleon Beach, a former burial site for British sailors who fell victim to 18th-Century yellow fever outbreaks, also falls within the boundaries. \n\nThe latter was only discovered when a 2010 hurricane uncovered remarkably well-preserved human remains paving the way for an extensive excavation project.\n\nFor this unique district where past and present collide, the Unesco award enforces strict oversight and severely limits future development to ensure the preservation of a place which encapsulates a crucial point in history.\nTL;DR: With its elegant colonial buildings and whimsical charm, it is hard to imagine how the Western Hemisphere's only working Georgian dockyard was once described by Lord Nelson as a \"vile hole\".\n\nArticle:

In 1997, Scottish GVA per hour was 94.8% of the UK average and in 2015 was 98.3%.\n\nSo why has Wales fallen behind?\n\nBy 1997 most of the structural change of the Welsh economy - the decline in coal and steel - had already taken place. Wales had enjoyed years of high levels of inward investment, particularly from Japanese manufacturers of consumer products, like TVs and microwaves, producing here to sell into the new European single market. \n\nRead more: Reality Check: Is Wales worse off after devolution?\n\n10 charts showing Wales since the devolution vote\n\nIt is hard to argue that the decline of traditional industries was the main reason that Wales fell behind in the last 20 years, although many communities were still ravaged by the effects of that.  \n\nThat was recognised by the European Union as it awarded Wales the highest level of economic aid, Objective One, in 2000, 2007 and for a third period again in 2014. \n\nSince 2000 an extra \u00a35.3bn has been injected into the Welsh economy from the EU beyond other sources of income like the block grant from Westminster.\n\nThe way in which the first tranche of EU aid was spent has been criticised by a number of academics and the Wales Audit Office for lacking economic and geographical focus.\n\nFor example every local authority seemed to be awarded its own new arts centre, among other things. \n\nBut bearing in mind the closeness of the vote in support of devolution perhaps that was the right approach politically, even if it was not the best option economically.\n\nThe new money from Brussels was also used to try to get more people into work through various training programmes and childcare schemes. \n\nEvidence suggests that nations and regions that choose a precise target for economic regeneration often succeed. \n\nIreland decided to go hook, line and sinker to attract technology firms, while the Basque country in Spain embraced radical urban planning and decided to stick with its traditional industries but modernise them through research and development. \n\nSo what has been the\"Big Idea\"for Wales in the last 20 years?\n\nWales scrapped government agencies in the so called\"Bonfire of the Quangos\"and gave voters free prescriptions and bus passes for older passengers. But those things do not in themselves make an economy vibrant.\n\nThe second and third tranches of EU regional aid have been characterised as working more closely with the private sector, but again without a single focus for the economy. Instead they have  instead a broad approach to increasing jobs and productivity.\n\nThere have been nine priority sectors for the economy. \n\nIt was difficult to identify an industry which did not fit into one of those. \n\nBut now Economy Secretary Ken Skates has announced that this number would be reduced to three as part of his new economic strategy.\n\nThere have also been industry-specific techniums to help business growth. Directing the private sector to work on certain sites does not seem to have been popular, with a few exceptions such as the Optic Centre at St Asaph.\n\nWhat certainly has been a major achievement for Wales, and which might not have been expected, is the halving of Welsh unemployment rates reducing it to the same as the UK average.\n\nIn 1997 unemployment in Wales was 7.2% while the UK was 6.6%. Now both are 4.3% That is no mean feat and something similar economic areas like the north east of England have not managed. \n\nBut at what cost? Low wages?\n\nComparing Wales and Scotland, in 1997 middle earners in both countries were paid \u00a3301 a week. In Wales, that now stands at \u00a3492 a week whereas in Scotland it is \u00a342 a week higher at \u00a3534.\n\nSimilarly, household incomes, which include benefits, pensions and investments, as a proportion of the UK average have risen in Scotland and fallen significantly in Wales.\n\nWith Scotland's oil and gas industries declining it is perhaps surprising that Scottish economy has performed so much better than Wales since devolution.\n\nWhat we do know is that the Scottish government has given considerable support to renewable energy and in particular onshore wind.  \n\nAnother contrast with Wales is that Scotland has retained its regional development agency Scottish Enterprise, whereas the Welsh Development Agency was scrapped in that quango cull. \n\nBut surely the answer to Scotland's success must lie in more than that? \n\nSo why hasn't Wales performed better? Critics of Welsh economic policies often argue that there has not been a single, finely-targeted, big idea and that economic policy has not changed significantly since the 1990s. \n\nOther approaches have been suggested by Welsh academics like Prof Calvin Jones, Dr Mark Lang and Prof Karel Williams and others. \n\nIt is worth noting that one of the most exciting economic developments in recent years is the compound semiconductor Catapault cluster and foundry in south east Wales. \n\nIt has been driven by the private sector, the Welsh firm IQE, and attracted significant investment and support from others in the private sector, Cardiff University, the Cardiff Capital Region as well as Welsh and UK governments. \n\nThat really does have the potential to change the economic landscape of Wales.  \n\nAny analysis of the Welsh economy since devolution needs to remember that without it, Wales would have had to deal with the full thrust of austerity. \n\nThe Welsh Government protected public services to some extent, and local authorities in Wales did not have to face budget cuts to the same extent as English ones. \n\nSimilarly the Welsh React and Proact programmes helped protect jobs and companies in Wales the as effect of the financial crisis of 2008 hit. Without those, and programmes like Jobs Growth Wales, the Welsh economy might well be in a poorer position now.\n\nWe must not ignore the fact that devolution gave tools to the Welsh Government to steer the economy to a certain extent but the big economic levers - setting income tax, interest rates and benefit levels - stayed with Westminster. \n\nThe challenge for Wales now is to learn from the past 20 years, use the tools it has, and be bold about the future.\nTL;DR: We have passed the milestone marking two decades of devolution in Wales.

In hot weather, why not take a cooling dip in the sea, and leave lockdown constraints on the beach with your towel?  But apart from the crowds and infection risk, beware of the political and economic undercurrents.  \n\nBrexit is about to surface once more - a giant creature that's been lurking in the shallows while attention has been turned elsewhere. With each round of inconclusive talks, it is those waters, and specifically the fish and shellfish in them, that become more central to the outcome.\n\nIt features a trial of negotiating strength, guile and apparently quite a lot of self-delusion. A great deal more depends on the outcome than the fishery jobs.\n\nYes, it's four months since the UK left the European Union, and seven months until the transition is scheduled to end. This week is an important one for deciding the terms of the new relationship, and the early signs are that it's going badly.\n\nSo it's time for an update, with a reminder of what was going on last time you paid any attention. \n\nAussie-style\n\nAt the end of January, Boris Johnson was busy booking his place in history, or so he thought.  What he was doing rather less was heeding the warning klaxons about an infection spreading rapidly in China. It's the latter that seems more likely to define his term as prime minister.\n\nHowever, the way things are looking, we could be heading not only for the biggest recession at least since the 1930s, thanks to Covid-19, but also that Brexit cliff-edge we were talking about last year. \n\nThere's no sign of entente breaking out via the Microsoft Teams meetings that have had to become the diplomatic channels for UK and EU negotiating teams.\n\nSupporters of Brexit are determined there will not be a delay on the 31 December end to transition. That remains, firmly, the government's position. \n\nIt can't simply play for time, and kick the can down Theresa May Boulevard, because the transition deal states that any delay has to be for at least two years. To Brexiteer Tory MPs, that's an impossibly high price for accepting an extension.\n\nLater this month, in a summit meeting, the two sides are scheduled to reflect on their negotiations and make a judgement as to whether it is worth continuing the effort to get a deal.\n\nAnd if they conclude there is not, those Brexiteers say: so be it - the UK would be trading with the European Union on what we have learned to call World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. Mr Johnson calls them Australia-style terms. Either way, they are the WTO's least effective arrangements to ease trading.\n\n'Johnny Foreigner'\n\nFor now, there are two broad schools of thinking on this.  One embraces a future where Britain can shed Europe's environmental, social and labour rules, and become more competitive than the European Union. For them, sovereignty is all and compromise is for Johnny Foreigner.\n\nThe other is aghast - looking at the unprecedented calamity that has struck the British, European and global economies due to Covid-19, and wondering how anyone could consider this a good time to take a risk on a full break from Europe's single market and customs union.  \n\nBrexiteer outrider commentators are arguing that the Brexit pain won't feel so bad in the context of suffering something much worse. \n\nBut from the academic network known as UK in a Changing Europe, there's been a reminder that their modelling suggests an economy that will grow 8.1% less in the next 10 years than it might otherwise be expected to do, while UK government modelling suggests a 7.6% shortfall.\n\n(We're very unlikely to be able to measure the true impact of Brexit, because there will be other, very powerful factors at work in trying to repair the economy post-pandemic. The closest we're likely to get is by comparison with similar countries still inside the EU.)\n\n'Dispensable'\n\nIn this crunch week of talks, the negotiating gulf is around promises which the EU members thought they had secured in tying Britain to Europe's\"level playing field\"of common standards on environment, social and labour market standards. \n\nThere is a big gap also on their expectation of how disputes over such standards will be resolved. The EU wants that in its Court of Justice. The UK says\"no way, Jose\".\n\nAnd then there's fish.  How is it that fisheries have become the third track of disagreement and impasse? And why, when one considers the industry is tiny, relative to the British economy (0.1% of economic output) and population, and it's tinier by EU ones?\n\nOne part of the answer is that fishing occupies a totemic and political role more than an economically significant one.  This was the British industry that was hit hardest by entry into the European Common Market. Whitehall in the 1970s saw it as\"dispensable\", or so it was admitted in an internal memo.\n\nEverything since then - including increased efficiency of catch forcing a reduction in the number of boats and men, and the harsh counter-measures to over-fishing - has been implemented through European institutions, so it's been blamed on Brussels. It has come, therefore, to be a special focus for Brexiteers.\n\nWith well over half the tonnage of fish caught in UK waters landed by foreign-registered boats - roughly eight times the amount caught by British boats in EU countries' waters - it has also become commercially important to the fishing fleets of the UK's nearest neighbours.\n\nQuid pro quo\n\nThe EU negotiating mandate wants to retain what it calls\"relative stability\", which is an allocation of quota based on the shares back in the 1970s. If anyone thinks European capitals are ready to go soft on Michel Barnier's mandate, they should be aware that he was told to strengthen the mandate - that is, not to trade away those fishing rights. \n\nLook at it from President Emmanuel Macron's point of view: his re-election efforts will not be helped if there's uproar and port blockades in the politically-significant Pas de Calais region. We recently got a taste of what is a serious risk, with a skirmish between boats fishing around the Channel Islands.\n\nThe British want annual negotiations, based on sustainable quotas. In the jargon, at which fishery management excels, it's called\"zonal attachment\". This assumes that the British government will have control over UK waters, so its fleet will get a much bigger share. \n\nThis is important to the UK negotiating position, which is the other reason fishing is disproportionately important to these talks.  This is one industry on which the UK has leverage. It has a lot to gain from ending CFP quotas, and a lot it could give.\n\nBut it needs to avoid quid pro quo deals in which fish are traded with access to European markets where the UK badly needs concessions from Brussels, such as the finance sector's reach into European markets.\n\nParking the sharing of fish quotas, by saying they'll be decided each year on the evidence available, and that Britain can relate to the CFP in the same way as Norway, would avoid the pressure to give ground on quota specifics as part of an over-arching deal.\n\nThe EU is firmly saying that the whole deal has to be integrated, without such side deals.  It also has some leverage on fisheries, in that Britain sells a lot of fish into the European market, and there are more jobs in processing than in fishing.\n\nNot all fishing businesses or communities are as gung-ho for Brexit as in north-east Scotland or Cornwall. Neither Hebridean creelmen nor Grimsby gutters want the disadvantage of tariffs being levied on those export sales, or of delays at the Channel for delivery of fresh produce.\n\nCapitulation\n\nHow will this work out?  With difficulty. Negotiations often involve bluster, claiming to be digging in to\"red line\"negotiating positions and timetables. The British side has been big on that approach since the 2016 referendum, allied to a consistent misreading of where negotiating power lies. It hasn't worked well so far, instead leading to a series of embarrassing capitulations. But this week, it's still the tactic being used.\n\nThis month, Boris Johnson will have to choose whether he continues the talks or plays to hardliners in his party who prefer\"no deal\"to compromise.\n\nThrough his handling of lockdown and the Cummings affair, the prime minister has weakened his position within Tory ranks. Facing him in the Commons, he now has a Labour opponent, in Sir Keir Starmer, who can hound him over the choice he makes.\n\nThe current impasse may turn out to be bluff. There's no point in hinting at an extension until the point when you have to propose one. Compromises, when they eventually come, tend to be made quickly.\n\nBut surprises aren't always welcome. For both sides, there is the need to get the deal through the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments.  Westminster is one. \n\nAnother parliament, without a veto, is at Holyrood. It will have a say, however, and a noisy one, in the months leading up to the next election. \n\nIn Scotland, Brexit is a faultline that currently looks likely to suit the SNP better than Jackson Carlaw's Tories.\nTL;DR: Time for an update on Brexit, which hasn't gone away, and nor have the UK or EU edged any closer to a deal on their future relationship. Boris Johnson goes into a summit this month, where he decides whether to keep trying for an agreement, or walk away and pay the high economic cost of 'no deal'. Fisheries has become a totemic and a real obstacle to a deal, where compromise looks particularly difficult, and here's why.\n\nArticle: John Coates confirmed to news agency AFP that the Olympics would start on 23 July next year, calling them the\"Games that conquered Covid\".\n\nThey were originally scheduled to start in July 2020, but were postponed due to Covid-19 fears.\n\nThe IOC had earlier said they would not delay the Games beyond 2021.\n\n\"The Games were going to be their theme, the Reconstruction Games after the devastation of the tsunami,\"Mr Coates told AFP, referring to 2011 catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\n\n\"Now very much these will be the Games that conquered Covid, the light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\nIn July, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto said it was possible that the Games be held to a\"limited\"audience, but said they wanted to avoid the possibility of having no spectators at all.  \n\nInstead, he added that the Games could potentially\"simplify\"its opening and closing ceremonies, as well as reduce the number of staff and delegations from each country.\n\nMore than 11,000 athletes from around 200 countries were scheduled to take part in the 2020 Games. It is not clear how travel restrictions might impact their participation as Japan's borders are currently largely closed to foreign visitors. \n\nMr Muto also said a vaccine was not a prerequisite for the Games, though health experts had cast doubt over whether the Games could be held without a vaccine. \n\n\"If a vaccine is ready, that will be a benefit, but we're not saying we can't hold the event without it - it's not a precondition,\"he said. \n\nIn April, Games chief Yoshiro Mori said the Tokyo Games would have to be cancelled if there were not held in 2021.\n\nExplaining this decision, IOC President Thomas Bach said:\"You cannot forever employ 3,000 to 5,000 people in an organising committee. You cannot every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations.\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, the Games had only ever been cancelled because of war, but never postponed.\nTL;DR: The postponed Tokyo Olympic Games will go ahead next year \"with or without Covid\", the vice-president of the International Olympic Committee says.\n\nArticle: Mark EastonHome editor@BBCMarkEastonon Twitter\n\nBut today the government's delayed Psychoactive Substances Act comes into force, introducing powers over what consumers can consume that are as radical and far-reaching as any such legislation ever.\n\nThe intention is to solve the UK's problems with\"legal highs\"- chemical products not covered by existing legislation that are causing some health and social problems.  \n\nLegal highs have been implicated in 76 deaths in the last 10 years (31 where they have been the sole cause), the Office for National Statistics said last month. \n\nHowever, that compares to 7,748 deaths involving illegal drugs, which has led some to question whether the government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. \n\nNevertheless, the Home Office's answer to the threat is to make it a crime to manufacture or supply such things.  \n\nIt is clearly impractical to introduce separate bans for every new mind-altering drug that comes along (there are thousands being developed all the time), so the new law pretty much bans everything that can be called a psychoactive substance.  \n\nIt is, basically, a ban on getting high.\n\nThe story of prohibition over the last 100 years is not a particularly happy one.  \n\nBanning alcohol in the US in 1920 pushed the trade underground, with criminals selling bootleg booze of dubious or dangerous quality.  \n\nSome 10,000 people died from drinking poisonous liquor before prohibition was lifted. \n\nMany argue the so-called\"War on Drugs\"has done the same: Simply handing the trade to unscrupulous international criminal gangs. \n\nDrug deaths in Britain are currently at record numbers.\n\nBut with no governmental appetite in Britain for decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs, prohibition remains the only response the Home Office is prepared to consider.   \n\nMinisters' first problem with prohibiting the trade in legal highs has been how to draft their ban so that cunning chemists cannot get round the law by tweaking the make-up of a substance to fall outside the latest list of illicit substances.  \n\nThat's why they ended up with a law that, with a few notable exceptions, bans the manufacture and distribution of everything that is\"capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\".\n\nThe notable exceptions include alcohol, nicotine and tobacco - not because they aren't dangerous and psychoactive, but because they are already so intertwined with our cultural and social lives. \n\nFoods like chocolate and beverages such as coffee and tea are also exempted for similar reasons.  \n\nBut the law seeks to prohibit the manufacture and sale of products with a\"psychoactive effect\"that may be far milder than a cappuccino or a Snickers bar.  \n\nBasically, the government is determined to stop people using any substance that causes an alteration in their state of consciousness - unless it is a large gin and tonic or a fat Cuban cigar, of course.\n\nBut banning almost anything that is\"capable of producing a psychoactive effect in a person who consumes it\"presented ministers with their next problem. How to prove that something does that?\n\nMy report from Ireland last year alerted many in the UK to a central problem with the law as it had been proposed.  \n\nThe Irish government introduced a very similar blanket ban in 2010. \n\nThe head shops were closed down but online suppliers moved in and use of new psychoactive substances in Ireland is now the highest in Europe. \n\nPolice told me they were almost powerless to intervene because prosecutors could not prove in court that a substance was psychoactive.\n\nBritish ministers were questioned about my report and set about trying to prevent similar problems with the courts here. \n\nFinding an answer was not easy and the Act was delayed by more than a month while they worked on a solution.\n\nNow the Home Office has come up with an answer: in-vitro testing.  \n\nSince you can't ask real human beings to take every dodgy looking product police seize to see if it has a psychoactive effect, the government has paid a commercial company to do a series of tests on existing legal highs in the lab (in-vitro).  \n\nThe aim is to identify a range of chemical structures that can be shown to bind with cell-based receptors and to which the body then responds.\n\nHaving isolated a number of what are called Certified Drug Reference Standards (CDRSs), prosecutors will only have to get an expert witness to say that a product contains a known CDRS to prove to the courts that it is psychoactive.\n\nWell, that's the theory.\n\nBut lawyers are already warning that this process has some tricky legal hurdles to clear. \n\nThe most obvious problem is convincing a judge that something achieved in a test-tube by a private testing company, paid for by the Home Office, will definitely happen in the human body.\n\nFor example, we know that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain and spinal cord from neurotoxins while allowing other molecules to pass through. \n\nIt is far from clear whether in-vitro testing will be able to show whether the BBB will give a particular chemical passage into the central nervous system.\n\nThe Home Office tests will not provide information on the potency of a specific compound, either.  \n\nIndeed, the guidance says this is not possible or necessary, because the law does not differentiate between something that is 100% or 0.01% pure.  \n\nThis means that a product that has such low potency it causes no noticeable psychoactive effect can still be described in law as having a psychoactive effect and banned. \n\nMinisters are concerned that some legal highs don't act on the body by binding with receptors - but they want to ban those too. \n\nSubstances like nitrous oxide and solvents cannot easily be subjected to in-vitro testing, so the guidance says prosecutions should be based on alternative sources of evidence including published literature and witness accounts of behaviour.\n\nDefence lawyers might well question whether a paper in a scientific journal and a witness saying the consumer looked a bit dopey is enough to get a conviction.\n\nLegal challenges are very likely in the early days of this act. \n\nBut it may be that over time a body of case-law and accepted science will mean prosecutions act as an effective brake on dangerous new psychoactive products.\n\nThe more troubling question, perhaps, is whether prohibition will once again hand the trade over to criminal gangs on the dark web, who are much more difficult to control than any High Street trader.\nTL;DR: Conservatives are usually opposed to the \"nanny state\" slapping draconian new rules on business or banning things that experts think might damage your health.\n\nArticle: The animals are already present in the River Clyde but it is hoped they can be stopped from reaching the River Annan.\n\nFirst found in Scotland in 1995, the crayfish have been blamed for eating young fish and destroying habitats.\n\nScottish Natural Heritage (SNH) described it as a\"landmark\"attempt to control the spread of the crustaceans.\n\nEnvironmental experts have identified a\"pressing need\"to stop the creatures moving from the Clyde into the Annan.\n\nA large number of rivers and lochs across Scotland have already been affected by the signal crayfish.\n\nThey include Loch Ken in Dumfries and Galloway where a five-month trapping programme two years ago killed more than 700,000 of them but failed to eradicate the problem.\n\nSNH hopes the new barrier will prevent similar problems on the River Annan, a popular location for salmon and trout fishing.\n\nRecent survey work on the River Clyde has shown that signal crayfish have spread into many of its headwaters sparking fears they might move into the neighbouring River Annan catchment, near the Beattock summit in South Lanarkshire.\n\nA partnership involving SNH, the Annan District Salmon Fisheries Board, the Clyde River Foundation and South Lanarkshire Council has put in the barriers.\n\n\"Unfortunately there are no techniques available that will allow us to get rid of signal crayfish from rivers and streams,\"said Dr Colin Bean, a freshwater adviser with SNH.\n\n\"So taking the radical step of developing and installing a physical barrier may offer us the best hope of stopping the species from moving into new catchments.\"\n\nTwo dams have now been installed 20 metres apart at a cost of \u00a350,000.\n\nNick Chisholm, director of the River Annan Trust and Fisheries Board said:\"The presence of crayfish on the Clyde has long been of concern to us.\n\n\"The Clyde and the Annan are hydraulically linked under certain conditions and there is no reason why, given time, that crayfish could not effectively walk over the hill.\n\n\"We know from bitter experience that once these animals are in an open water course, they are impossible to eradicate and can cause massive damage to the native fauna.\"\n\nDr Willie Yeomans, catchment manager with the Clyde River Foundation said the crayfish had made a\"measurable difference\"to the river within a decade.\n\n\"Crayfish have changed the ecology of the Clyde forever and this is a stark reminder to us all about the need for biosecurity and the need to avoid the introduction of invasive non-native species,\"he said.\n\nIf successful, the barrier could be used in other parts of the country to stop the crayfish reaching other rivers and lochs.\n\nMr Bean said:\"We can't prevent them from becoming a problem in rivers where they currently exist, but at least this would give us some hope that we can control their spread in the future.\"\nTL;DR: A barrier has been installed between two Scottish rivers in an attempt to block the spread of non-native North American signal crayfish

Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold, by contrast, has a considerable gap between each screen when folded. \n\n\u201cWith the new Razr we had to rethink how to engineer a phone,\u201d said Glenn Schultz, the firm\u2019s head of product development. \n\n\u201cOur zero-gap hinge allowed us to bring to market a device that folds completely in half. Many didn\u2019t believe we could do it, but let me tell you, it's fun to work on something that everyone thinks is impossible.\u201d \n\nMotorola\u2019s intent to release its first foldable device became apparent at the beginning of this year when the firm\u2019s application for a patent was discovered by mobile phone news blog 91 Mobiles. \n\nReports had suggested the device would be released in the summer, but it suffered unspecified setbacks. That allowed other manufacturers, such as Samsung, to beat them to market. However, Samsung\u2019s haste meant its Galaxy Fold device was besieged with problems, and the company has warned about the $2,000 device\u2019s durability. \n\nThe firm said the new Razr was water resistant, though in an attempt to reassure consumers, Motorola said its screen could be replaced free of charge within 24 hours, while the product is still under warranty.  \n\nThe new Razr will become the first flip phone - or \u201cclam shell\u201d - to make use of a foldable screen. When shut, the device has a thickness of 14mm. The original Razr was 13.9mm. \n\nThe outer screen - which the company refers to as the Quick View display - can be used to view notifications, reply to messages (using either a fixed response or a voice reply), take calls and make contactless payments. \n\nAt its developers\u2019 conference in October, Samsung teased a similar vertically-folding phone on stage, but did not offer any specifics, saying it was simply \u201cexploring\u201d the idea. \n\nTumbling market share\n\nThe slow emergence of foldable devices presents an opening for the more minor players in the sector to release a breakthrough device, just as Motorola did in 2004 with its original Razr, famed for its slim build and metallic aesthetic.  \n\nIt was unveiled to the world with the help of Paris Hilton and David Beckham, who were photographed extensively while holding up the device; side on so people could see how strikingly slim it was. \n\nBy creating arguably the first mobile device to successfully cross the bridge from tech into fashion, Motorola\u2019s mobile devices business soared. By 2006, less than two years after Razr\u2019s debut, Motorola was selling almost a quarter of the world\u2019s mobile phones, second only to Finnish giant Nokia. \n\n\u201cThe Motorola Razr V3 was an extraordinary device,\u201d recalled Mr Wood. \n\n\u201cIt was a true fashion icon, initially in silver aircraft grade aluminium. Later there were a whole spectrum of colours, notably the highly successful pink Razr and also the memorable Dolce & Gabbana version - which at the time cost an eye-watering \u00a3400.\u201d \n\nBut then the iPhone arrived.

How did they form? And how have they changed through time?\n\nThe telescope was taken into orbit on a Russian Soyuz rocket that set off from French Guiana at 08:54 GMT.\n\nThe ride to 700km lasted 145 minutes.\n\nCheops (short for CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite) is a joint endeavour of 11 member states of the European Space Agency (Esa), with Switzerland in the lead.\n\nProf Didier Queloz, who won this year's Physics Nobel for discovering the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star in 1995, was on hand to watch the launch.\n\n\"I think it's great. We started this project more than 10 years ago and now that's it - we're in the sky,\"said the chair of the Cheops science team.\n\nWhat will Cheops do?\n\nThe University of Bern, together with the University of Geneva, has provided a powerful photometer for the telescope. \n\nThe instrument will measure the tiny changes in light when a world passes in front of its host star.\n\nThis event, referred to as a transit, will betray a precise diameter for the planet because the changes in light are proportional to the surface of the world. When that information is combined with data about the mass of the object - obtained through other means - it will be possible for scientists to deduce a density.\n\n\"From that we can say something about the planet's composition and internal structure,\"said Esa project scientist Dr Kate Isaak.\"And by measuring this for many different planets orbiting different types of stars, those close in and far out - we can also say something about the formation and evolution of planets,\"she told BBC News.\n\nWhat's significant about this mission?\n\nSome 4,500 planets have been discovered since the late 1990s using a variety of techniques. But there is a feeling now that the science has to move beyond just detection; beyond just counting planets. We need to profile the objects in a more sophisticated way. Do they have atmospheres and how thick are they? What kind of clouds? Do they possess oceans on their surface? Do they have rings and moons? Cheops ought to be able to address such questions just from looking for these tiny dips in light during a transit.   \n\nThe mission has been given a list of 400-500 targets to look at over the next 3.5 years. Most of these worlds will be in the size range between Earth and Neptune, sometimes called\"super Earths\". From all the exoplanet surveys conducted to date, this grouping would seem to dominate the statistics. \n\nHow sensitive is Cheops?\n\nIt will be concentrating on bright stars, but even so - its observations will still be challenging.\n\nWhen a Jupiter-sized planet passes in front of a Sun-like star, the drop in light as viewed by Cheops will be as little as 1% of the total signal. If an Earth-sized planet does the same thing, the drop-off will be a hundred times smaller again, at 0.01%. \n\n\"The difficulty was in building an optical system that is capable of measuring these minute light changes,\"recalled Prof Willy Benz, the Cheops consortium principal investigator.\n\n\"To give you an example, when we wanted to test this in the lab we didn't find a single light source in the world that was stable to this precision to allow us to test our telescope - so we had to build one.\"\n\nHow does it fit with other missions?\n\nThe Americans are currently flying a space telescope called the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), a follow-on to the highly successful Kepler observatory. Both are planet-finders and have had input into the candidates soon to be pursued by the 280kg Cheops observatory. \n\nThe Nasa ventures have, if you like, provided the shortlist for the European telescope. Its studies will now whittle the targets down still further to find the most promising subjects for the next generation of planet investigators. These missions will have the ability to analyse the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres, looking for gases that might hint at the presence of life. The most eagerly awaited is the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) due for launch in 2021.\n\n\"It's very classic in astronomy that you use a small telescope'to identify', and then a bigger telescope'to understand' - and that's exactly the kind of process we plan to do,\"said Prof Queloz. \n\n\"Cheops will now pre-select the very best of the best candidates to apply to extraordinary equipment like very big telescopes on the ground and JWST. This is the chain we will operate.\"\n\nThe 30cm-aperture telescope was a secondary passenger on the Soyuz launch. The primary payload was an Italian radar satellite. \n\nCheops was released from the Soyuz' Fregat upper-stage at an altitude of 709km, moving at a speed of over 7.5km/s.\n\nOne of the early tasks for controllers, who are based in Spain, will be to open a protective door to the optics. \n\nDr Isaak said:\"The next few days are going to be very interesting. We're going to be working at the mission operations centre to check out the spacecraft. And then once that's done, everybody will have a very well deserved Christmas break. And we're back in the New Year to exercise the instrument, to check it's survived the launch, to see how it performs, and look to see then how we're going to process the data which is the end product that we're all very much looking forward to.\"\n\nScience operations will be run out of the University of Geneva.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: The European Cheops space telescope has launched to study planets outside our Solar System.\n\nArticle: Campaign groups want the park to include\"outstanding landscape\"between Silecroft and Grange-over-Sands as well as the Cartmel peninsulas.\n\nThe proposal, sent to Natural England, would increase the size of the park by 155 sq km - around six per cent. \n\nNatural England and the Secretary of State for the Environment will make the final decision.\n\nA number of consultation events are being held to give residents and businesses the chance to comment on the plans, which were submitted by the Friends of the Lake District.\n\nThe Southern Boundary Partnership (SBP), a local campaign group, said the proposed new area of the park would be given extra protection, and would benefit from increased local businesses and tourism.\n\nDavid Savage, chairman of SBP, said:\"National Park designation will help to ensure that our spectacular landscape is properly valued and managed appropriately.\"\n\nThe plans will also see the estuaries of the rivers Duddon, Leven and Kent become part of the park, which was awarded World Heritage Status in 2017.\nTL;DR: Plans to increase the size of the Lake District National Park by expanding it into south Cumbria have been revealed.\n\nArticle: About 85,000 German-language copies of the anti-Semitic Nazi manifesto have been sold. Publisher Andreas Wirsching said\"the figures overwhelmed us\". \n\nHe is director of the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich. \n\nBut the sales are well below those of best-sellers in Germany. It is an academic edition, costing \u20ac58 (\u00a349).\n\nAt the end of January the IfZ will launch a sixth print run. The book contains critical notes by scholars.\n\nUnlike the Nazi-era editions, the IfZ's Mein Kampf (My Struggle) has a plain white cover - without a picture of Hitler. The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany.\n\nMr Wirsching told the German news agency DPA that the IfZ was planning a shorter, French-language edition.\"But two-thirds of our commentaries will be translated\"for it, he said.\n\nThe first print run in Germany in 2016 was 4,000 copies. \n\nLife of Adolf Hitler\n\nAustria MPs vote to seize Hitler's house\n\nHimmler diaries show daily Nazi horrors\n\nLiving with a Nazi name\n\nThe decision to republish the inflammatory book was criticised by Jewish groups. Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power.\n\nIt sets out racist ideas that the Nazis put into practice later, including the denigration and oppression of Jews and Slavs. \n\n'Not a runaway hit' - the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin writes:\n\nThe fact that the Nazi manifesto reached number one in Der Spiegel's non-fiction charts in April is cited as evidence that Adolf Hitler's propaganda is making a comeback in Germany. \n\nBut the term\"best-seller\"does not necessarily mean very much. A quarter of all books sold in Germany are bought in the run-up to Christmas. At other times of the year it is possible to top listings with relatively few sales. \n\nMein Kampf (My Struggle) is an expensive academic text, and is being bought by libraries, schools and history academics. \n\nFor a German non-fiction book sales of 85,000 are not bad. But the figures don't indicate a runaway hit. \n\nThe current biggest non-fiction seller is The Hidden Life of Trees, a book about the ecosystem of woodland, which has sold half a million copies so far. \n\nRead Damien's analysis in full here.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the state of Bavaria. Under German law copyright lasts for 70 years.\n\nWhile the Bavarian regional government held the copyright, reprinting of the book was banned. But the copyright expired a year ago.\n\nMr Wirsching said he favoured\"clever\"teachers using the IfZ edition in the classroom. He warned against\"repeating the absurd 1950s discussion, when people said'it was all Hitler's fault'.\"\n\nHe said the IfZ had obtained solid legal advice before republishing the book on a limited scale. And the scholarly edition was aimed partly at pre-empting any editions put out by Nazi sympathisers.\n\n\"It would be irresponsible to just let this text spread arbitrarily,\"he told DPA.\nTL;DR: The German publisher of a special annotated edition of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf says sales have soared since its launch a year ago.\n\nArticle: Central Building Contractors (Glasgow) Ltd has won a contract to undertake major repairs to Paisley Town Hall's stonework and create new interior space from its existing cloisters.\n\nIt will also be made more accessible for people with disabilities.\n\nThe work will be completed in time for the building to play host to the Mod in October 2013.\n\nThe contract, which was awarded by Renfrewshire Council, will lead to several new jobs and work placements for 16 to 19-year-olds.\n\nTwo existing apprenticeships will be continued. \n\nThe refurbishment work will also provide support for a programme which aims to help young people develop life skills through a variety of training and workshops.\n\n'Amazing legacy'\n\nRenfrewshire councillor Iain McMillan said:\"The Victorians gifted us an amazing architectural legacy. \n\n\"This refurbishment programme gives us an opportunity to create jobs and training places while also making one of our top entertainment venues much more accessible for people with disabilities.\n\n\"It's important to use investment in our architectural heritage to take forward economic regeneration and this programme achieves that aim.\"\n\nPaisley Town Hall was completed in 1882. \n\nThe cash for the building originally came from George Clark, a member of the famous thread manufacturing family. \n\nIn 1873 he left \u00a320,000 in his will to pay for the building.\nTL;DR: A Renfrewshire landmark is to undergo a \u00a31.6m refurbishment ahead of next year's Royal National Mod.\n\nArticle: Severe bad weather in February saw an embankment severely damaged next to the track running between Dumfries and Kilmarnock.\n\nIt prompted a major repairs operation at the site near Holywood in Dumfries and Galloway.\n\nNetwork Rail said 6,000 tonnes of stone had been brought in to restore and strengthen the embankment.\n\nDetailed examination of the landslip found hundreds of tonnes of debris had slipped from under the railway -

These episodes create a spectacular natural firework display, replete with bubbles, fountains and flows of lava. Within minutes, neighbouring towns and villages are showered with flakes of ash and other debris.\n\n'Lava falling on my roof'\n\nIrene's trip with her mother through the deserted streets of her home town of Nicolosi, on Etna's slopes, turned into a nightmare when her Peugeot 107 car was stopped by a sound she had never heard before. \n\n\"It was like a sudden crackling; like hail pouring down and popping around. I thought it was because of the ash on the street,\"she said.\"Instead, it was fragments of lava (lapilli) falling on both my roof and my windscreen from a giant red cloud right over me.\"\n\nIt was 16 February and the sky was already inflamed by the sunset. It was to be the first in an array of violent episodes on Etna, increasing in power each time. Those paroxysms have since come in the middle of the night, at sunrise, during a storm and even under the light of a full moon. \n\nIrene Corsaro could feel the stones grinding under the car's tyres and she soon realised how lucky she was to be wearing her anti-Covid facemask.\"The red-coloured air was very poor, heavy to breathe in.\"They rushed home to pack in case they needed to evacuate.\n\nClouds of sulphur dioxide (SO2), visible from space, have reached as far away as China. But the ash and the heavier lapilli stay local. They drape the sides of the volcano and blanket at least 16 towns around Etna's cone. Fornazzo, Giarre and Zafferana are among those affected, and even coastal towns like Riposto and Torre Archirafi. \n\nEtna has released some 40 million cubic metres of volcanic material, says volcanologist Boris Behncke, who monitors Etna closely for the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV).\n\n\"It is quite a lot,\"he tells the BBC. In comparison, the Etna eruption that threatened the town of Randazzo in 1981 released a mere 20 million cubic metres of material.\n\nWatching Etna's destructive power\n\nFrom my window, 20km (12 miles) south-east of Etna's summit, I have an unbroken view of the volcano. There is something primordial about being indoors as nature unleashes its energy.\n\nIt starts with a column of dust that can climb as high as 12km, then lava fountains, pyroclastic flow and even lightning - mainly from the south-east crater, but from the other three as well.\n\nThe eruptions may be spectacular, but they are a nuisance too. \n\nLava dust falls over my head and over my washing line. I have spent much of the past three weeks of curfew sweeping the floor.\n\nMy car windscreen is constantly covered by a dark patina of grime, but you must not use water to clear it. This glaze contains sharp glass particles that will scrape it beyond repair. No wonder some people have wrapped up their parked cars in bed-sheets to protect them.\n\nWhen it rains, the drizzle turns carpets of lava dust into something resembling concrete. It blocks gutters and drainage channels, prompting flooding and water seeping into houses.\n\nEtna's explosions generate\"infrasonic waves\"that the human ear does not pick up because of their low sound frequency, but the glass in the windows does. \n\nAfter so many eruptions, you can now tell what Etna is doing simply by listening to the trembling of the windows. It wakes you up with a jolt in the middle of the night. The sound of a column of ash and dust is different, more of a jingle-jangle.\n\nTwelve tonnes of dust\n\nThe damage to the area has been immense and the Sicilian region has declared a crisis for 13 towns on Etna and another 30 surrounding the volcano.\n\nOrange groves and other crops have been destroyed and on one occasion the motorway between Fiumefreddo and Giarre was shut to allow dust to be cleared. Motorbikes are banned and the speed limit has been cut to 20km/h.\n\nSchools in Giarre were shut for three days and the weekly market suspended. Locals have been instructed to collect the dust in transparent bags and not to mix it with ordinary rubbish.\n\n\"We have to deal with six kilos of volcanic dust in every square metre, with a total of 12 tonnes,\"Giarre Mayor Angelo D'Anna told the BBC.\n\n\"The latest black rain lasted just 30 minutes and generated as much rubbish as we usually have in a year. It'll cost up to \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3510,000) and we are worried because it is going to happen again and again. How can we pay for it?\"\n\nThe regional government is to provide \u20ac1m and will ask the Rome government for more help, but there is no regional plan to manage the dust. It may be a natural phenomenon, but it is treated as waste and there is not yet anything planned to remove it.\n\nSweeping balconies of black dust has become a regular event for the thousands who live in the towns around Etna.\n\nEvery roof, terrace, porch, veranda and geranium-adorned balustrade has turned black. Even gardens are barely green any more.\n\nHow unusual are the eruptions?\n\nEtna is no stranger to these episodes. Despite the extraordinary amount of volcanic material that has erupted, experts agree the volcano is merely repeating previous patterns of behaviour. But they also admit that the power released is greater than before.\n\n\"In the past we witnessed two or three strong events, and others that were weaker,\"says volcanologist Boris Behncke.\"Now every paroxysm is strong. Nonetheless, at the moment Etna is deflating, there is no more magma coming and its system is stable.\"\n\nI have sensed a change too. I have always seen an eruption with a flame that goes on and off like a lighter. This time I have seen at least three tongues of flame with lava fountains on both sides of Etna, and a constant wall of flame.\n\nAs long as the activity remains on the summit there is no danger. More eruptions are likely, but not even the experts can predict when.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nEtna: Italy's INGV\nTL;DR: Irene Corsaro will never forget her first driving lesson under a rain of black ash from Mount Etna.

Practical matters like October holidays, the UK party conference season and Scotland's famed wintry weather were all potential obstacles.\n\nIncidentally, 2014 also happens to be the year two prestigious sporting events - the Ryder Cup golf tournament and the Commonwealth Games - are being held in Scotland.\n\nAnd for the more romantically-minded, next year is also the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, which saw the English army defeated by the forces of King of Scots Robert the Bruce, during the wars of independence.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nEssentially, everyone over the age of 16 who lives in Scotland.\n\nThe voter\"franchise\", as it's known, is largely the same as for a Scottish Parliament and council elections, with the addition of lowering the voting age from 18.\n\nThat means the 800,000 Scots who live in other parts of the UK don't get a vote, while the 400,000 people from elsewhere in Britain who live in Scotland do.\n\nAll the main players on both sides of the debate agree this is the fairest way to do things.\n\nEligibility to take part in the referendum also includes members of the armed services serving overseas who are registered to vote in Scotland.\n\nWhat will be on the ballot paper?\n\nVoters will be asked the yes/no question:\"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\n\nThe Scottish government's original version of the question,\"Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?\", was dropped after the Electoral Commission raised concerns it could lead people into voting\"yes\".\n\nPast incarnations of the referendum question have proved far more wordy.\n\nThe SNP previously said people could be asked to vote\"Yes I agree\"or\"No I disagree\"to the statement:\"The Scottish Parliament should negotiate a new settlement with the British government, based on the proposals set out in the white paper, so that Scotland becomes a sovereign and independent state.\"\n\nWho is in charge of the referendum?\n\nMSPs have approved the terms of the vote in the SNP government's Scottish Independence Referendum Bill.\n\nThis followed the signing of what became known as the Edinburgh Agreement, by Mr Salmond and UK Prime Minister David Cameron - a measure to ensure the referendum could be\"made in Scotland\"and held on a fully legal basis.\n\nThere is no turnout requirement for this referendum - that means a\"Yes\"vote of\"50% plus one\"would be enough to gain independence. \n\nThe Scottish government says the bill will make sure that:\n\nThe UK government agreed to give temporary powers to the Scottish Parliament to hold a legal referendum, under Section 30 of the 1998 Scotland Act - the piece of legislation which set up the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThis is because constitutional matters are reserved to Westminster. \n\nThe Edinburgh Agreement also commits both governments to working together constructively in the best interests of the people of Scotland, whatever the outcome of the referendum - possibly easier said than done.\n\nThe SNP's parliamentary majority at Holyrood will ensure the bill is passed.\n\nWho will be campaigning?\n\nYes Scotland is the official campaign for independence, while Better Together is the group arguing to keep the Union.\n\nVarious political parties have given their support to the two campaigns, depending on their constitutional persuasion, although they are also running their own campaigns, as are the Scottish and UK governments.\n\nThe Scottish Greens also back independence, as does independent MSP Margo MacDonald, while Labour, the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are opposed.\n\nIt's likely that other campaign groups will spring up as the campaign goes on.\n\nHow far back does Scotland's modern independence movement go?\n\nThe campaign for Scottish home rule began in earnest almost as soon as the unification with England took place, in 1707.\n\nAt the time, the view was that Scotland was desperate for cash, but opponents of the move were outraged by claims that the Scots who put their names to the Act of Union were bribed.\n\nThe episode moved Scotland's Bard, Robert Burns, to write:\"We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation.\"\n\nFast forward many years to 1934, and the establishment of the Scottish National Party, created through the amalgamation of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland.\n\nAfter decades of ups and downs, the nationalists won their first election in 2007, forming a minority government, before becoming the first party to win an overall majority at Holyrood in the 2011 poll - securing a mandate for an independence referendum.\n\nHas devolution helped the independence campaign?\n\nThe creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 presented a significant opportunity for the SNP, which at the time had a handful of MPs who were struggling to make the case for independence at Westminster.\n\nThe prime minister who delivered devolution, Tony Blair, was aware of the potential opportunity a Scottish Parliament could give the SNP.\n\nSo, the Scottish Parliament's part first-past-the-post, part PR voting system was intended to prevent any one party (ie the SNP) gaining an overall majority.\n\nThis was the case initially - up to the 2011 election there had been two terms of a Labour/Lib Dem coalition and one of an SNP minority government.\n\nThe 2011 result blew out of the water the claim once made by Labour veteran Lord Robertson that devolution would\"kill nationalism stone dead\".\n\nCould the situation now be more akin to comments by another Labour stalwart, Tam Dalyell, who described devolution as\"a motorway to independence with no U-turns and no exits?\"\n\nDoes Scotland want independence?\n\nHard to say with any great certainty at the moment.\n\nThere is no shortage of polling data on the issue of independence, putting support at various levels.\n\nPolling expert John Curtice says the British Social Attitudes survey is the only exercise of its kind which has asked the same question about constitutional preferences going back to the foundation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.\n\nHe says support for independence has tended to oscillate between about a quarter and a third, with an instalment of the survey published in January, suggesting the figure was at its lowest level since the creation of the Holyrood parliament in 1999.\n\nA total of 23% of the 1,229 people questioned between July and November last year said they favoured the proposition that,\"Scotland should become independent, separate from the rest of the UK\".\n\nIn response, the SNP say the period of time in which the field work was carried out has been overtaken by events.\n\nProf Curtice, co-author of the survey, also warns:\"In truth, there isn't any clear evidence that either one side or the other, over the whole period of devolution, has made significant progress either in reducing support for independence or succeeding in increasing it.\"\n\nAnother factor is the number of people who vote SNP, but are not necessarily convinced that independence is the way to go.\n\nProf Curtice adds:\"The SNP undoubtedly has succeeded in providing Scotland with what people regard as effective government - but there isn't any clear evidence of any long-term increase in support for independence since 2007.\"\n\nIn the Scottish Parliament elections of 1999 and 2003, Labour's plan to essentially scare people out of support for independence worked.\n\nNow it seems the public are much less afraid, and, whether or not it's the case that majority support for independence exists, seem much more willing to put it to the test in a referendum.\n\nThere are many other factors which could affect support for independence - the state of the economy for one thing, and of course every politician's worst nightmare - unforeseen events, or\"unknown unknowns\", as former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld once put it.\n\nThe SNP has an overall majority in Scotland - why does it not simply declare independence?\n\nThe SNP has always taken the view that, on an issue of such significance, it would first need the backing of the Scottish people in a referendum.\n\nIt also needs this mandate to negotiate an independence settlement with the UK government.\n\nWhat happens in the event of a'Yes' Vote?\n\nAlex Salmond wants to declare\"Independence Day\"in March 2016, with the first elections to an independent parliament in May.\n\nBefore that happens though, a constitutional settlement would need to be agreed with the UK government, involving weighty issues which may take a long time to resolve.\n\nDefence is one - especially since the SNP want rid of Britain's nuclear weapons, based at the Faslane naval base on the Clyde. (Although Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon recently said Trident would remain temporarily at Faslane while an independent Scotland's Naval HQ was being established there.)\n\nOn the financial front, agreement in areas like Scotland's share of the national debt and its continued use of the pound - at least initially - would also be needed.\n\nEven after independence is achieved there are other hurdles to clear - European Union and Nato membership to name but two.\n\nWhat happens if there is a'No' Vote? Would there be another referendum? \n\nAlex Salmond has described the independence referendum as a once-in-a-generation event.\n\nAll the parties - unionist and pro-independence - are keen to avoid the situation which has unfolded in the Canadian province of Quebec, where debate over multiple independence referendums over the years has been dubbed the\"neverendum\".\n\nA\"No\"result in the referendum could spell the end for the SNP as a mainstream political force.\n\nIt's also likely that focus would shift back to the debate over more powers for Holyrood - with full fiscal autonomy, as opposed to relying on the Treasury block grant, possibly becoming a more serious option.\n\nThe opposition parties are already working on offers along those lines, ahead of the referendum.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are furthest down the road here with their dream of Scottish home rule and significant new financial and other powers devolved from Westminster.\n\nA commission set up by Scottish Labour has suggested there is a\"strong case\"for Holyrood gaining full income tax powers.\n\nThe Conservatives - which previously opposed devolution itself - have had the most significant shift in thinking.\n\nTheir leader Ruth Davidson - who once said she wished to draw\"a line in the sand\"over new powers for Holyrood - has now supported increased financial responsibility for the Edinburgh parliament.\nTL;DR: Next autumn, the people of Scotland will vote on whether the nation should become an independent country. \n\nThe deal to hold the referendum has been done and the date has been set - now it's up to the campaigners to put their case.  \n\n\n\nArticle: Annabelle and Cliff Baldock posted online a DJ set from their home in Ipswich on Facebook on Saturday night.\n\nMembers of the'Big Fancy Dress Party - Beating Covid-19' group shared live videos and images of their costumes. \n\nMrs Baldock, 48, said the event was the perfect remedy\"to a dull few weeks\"during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nExplaining their inspiration for the event, Mrs Baldock said:\"We were sat thinking how things have changed and that people couldn't go out like they usually do at the weekend.\n\n\"We started a group on Facebook with our family and friends and it kept getting shared.

I deserve this justice, it's high time now.\"\n\nTop of the Pops\n\nThe 1990s Bollywood music scene was dominated by Nadeem-Shravan, the duo Saifi formed with musical partner Shravan Rathod. \n\nThey were famed for their romantic pop melodies in films such as Aashiqi and quickly became the foremost music producers in the industry, responsible for turning the likes of Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayan into household names.  \n\nBut their dominance came to a sudden end with the 1997 killing of Gulshan Kumar, the then-manager of T-Series, one of India's largest music labels.  \n\nKumar was Saifi and Rathod's patron, the man who gave them their first break, and the man Saifi calls\"Papa Ji\".\n\nSaifi was on holiday in the UK in 1997 when Kumar was shot dead by assailants outside a temple in suburban Mumbai and soon became a prime suspect in the murder. \n\nPolice claimed the businessman was the victim of a conspiracy between Saifi and others.\n\nAt the request of the Mumbai police, the Indian government asked for Saifi's extradition.  \n\nThe musician's legal team maintained that the police's evidence was flawed and, after an extended legal battle, he successfully avoided extradition. \n\nA UK High Court judgement stated that\"the accusation of murder and conspiracy made against this applicant is not made in good faith and in the interests of justice\".\n\nThe verdict was later upheld by the House of Lords after the Indian government appealed.  \n\nIn 2002, a Mumbai Session Court convicted only one man out of a possible 19 suspects named in Kumar's murder. The judge at the time disregarded the prosecution's suggestion of a wider conspiracy.\n\nSaifi has been using these judgements as proof of his innocence ever since. However, his arrest warrant is still on the books.\n\nHe must appear in an Indian court for the warrant to be cancelled but fears he will not get a fair hearing, going so far as to suggest his implication in the murder case was itself a conspiracy.\n\n\"It was just an act of jealousy from certain people who thought,'let's nail this good-looking hunk of a guy,'\"he told the BBC.\n\nAsked about the murder, Saifi broke into a tearful song he had composed, demanding India gives him justice. \n\nHe then said:\"Sixteen years patiently I have borne itna zulm [this oppression]. My children have always seen me crying and for what?\n\n\"For a crime I have not committed. For a crime I have never even thought about.\"\n\nSaifi refuses to return despite the advice of his legal team, which includes celebrity defence lawyer Majeed Memon. According to Memon, his client\"cannot get his name cleared from outside [India]\".\n\nMusical comeback\n\nSaifi has not recorded anything of note since the late 1990s and is now without his former music partner. \n\nYet he remains positive when asked whether he can make a successful comeback.\n\n\"God willing, I will still continue to lead the scene with my good music,\"he said.\"The time has come now to perform my songs.\"\n\nHe insists he has been encouraged by his fans to return to music.\"They are missing that work and I think it's my duty as long as I'm alive to cater to that need.\"\n\nSaifi is currently working in Dubai on various projects but is yet to confirm a release date for his new material. \n\nHear the full interview with Nadeem Saifi on Bobby Friction's show on  BBC Asian Network on 19 February from 17:30 GMT.\nTL;DR: Indian musician Nadeem Saifi, who has been living in exile since being accused of murder in 2000, has demanded an apology from the Indian government.\n\nArticle: By Owain ClarkeBBC Wales health correspondent\n\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething is setting up a taskforce after a review of amber response times. \n\nHe said he was\"increasingly concerned\"and would not rule out fines among a\"range of options\"to improve things. \n\nThere were 79,150 wasted hours - the equivalent of nine years - last year for crews waiting outside A&E.\n\nThe bulk of 999 calls are ranked as amber and ambulances have been taking longer to reach these patients.\n\nThere is a 15 minute quality target for how long ambulances should be waiting outside hospitals. Anything beyond this counts as a handover delay. \n\nThe number of patients delayed in this way in November 2019 was 513 - the highest number since March 2016.\n\nMr Gething said in a written statement to assembly members:\"As an immediate step, I have asked officials to develop proposals for a system of incentives to achieve desired improvements. \n\n\"I expect to take a decision within the next couple of weeks to enable the new system to be introduced in time to impact on performance this winter.\n\n\"This will be one element of a broader approach to incentives that will in due course focus on other parts of the urgent and emergency care system to drive improved performance.\"\n\nHe told BBC Wales he had an open mind about a potential sanction and would not rule out fines among a\"range of options\".\n\nHow is the ambulance service performing?\n\nFreeing up ambulances as fast as possible is seen as vital when it is set against a background of the rise in the number of emergency calls - about 40,000 a month.\n\nLast month, ministers said it was\"disappointing\"to see the target for red ambulance calls missed for the first time.  In November, 61.4% of ambulances arrived at life-critical calls within eight minutes; the target is 65%.\n\nBut the Welsh Government said the average response in this category remained at six minutes and 39 seconds and 73% of patients received a response within 10 minutes.\n\nAbout 70% of emergency calls are amber, these can include people with chest pains or strokes. \n\nAccording to the latest set of figures, 43.3% were responded to within 30 minutes. But the median (middle of the range) response time for amber calls has been steadily rising and is now more than 30 minutes.\n\nMr Gething believes ambulance availability is\"the single main determinant for the timeliness of amber response\". \n\nHe also highlighted the demands the ambulance service faced during the Christmas and new year period:\n\nJason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said he would welcome any action which was\"proportionate and necessary\".\n\nHe added:\"Less serious patients have been waiting longer than we'd want. We'd welcome any action and incentives put into the system, to encourage us to hand over patients more quickly.\"\n\n'The pressure's on every day'\n\nWayne Davies has been a paramedic in north east Wales since 2004. He also has a senior role which helps decide which ambulances to free up at hospitals.\n\nHis rapid response vehicle deals with red emergency calls as well as amber calls. He can assess patients and decide whether they need help at the scene or should be taken to hospital.\n\n\"The pressure's on every day, seven days a week. It can vary quite dramatically,\"he said. \n\n\"It can be very frustrating - having seven vehicles outside emergency departments and unable to offload means we can't get to patients [back] in the community as quickly as we'd like to.\"\n\nUsing a GP in the emergency contact centre means they can help deal with calls on the phone. \n\nOne amber call we saw was Hayley, who had passed out unconscious at home in Prestatyn after an asthma attack. She had already been in hospital at the weekend and was on antibiotics and steroids.\n\nThe contact centre GP assessed her over the phone before Wayne was sent to check on her. He then arranged an emergency appointment with her own GP - as she faced a wait in the surgery.\n\n\"The doctor [on the phone] was very good, very thorough,\"said Hayley. \n\n\"They told me they were going to send the paramedics - it wasn't worth them sending the ambulance and me having to wait in A&E for such a long time. I feel like I've had very good care today. \n\n\"We could see the pressure in A&E the other day. There were no beds - I was talking to lady with a chest infection who'd been there since 7am and she got a bed about 11:30 on the Saturday night.\"\n\nWayne said:\"At this time of year, there's lots of cold and flu and the cold weather has an effect - on the elderly, the young and people with chronic illnesses. \n\n\"There's been a significant increase in demand across the board, extending from winter pressures, population becomes elderly, plus new builds and a transient population coming into the area.\"\n\n'The highest I've seen is 26 calls waiting'\n\nGill Pleming, a manager at the emergency call centre in Llanfairfechan, Conwy county, has been with the ambulance service for 35 years and worked as both a paramedic and call handler. \n\n\"Demand is unprecedented, I would say, to what it was back then, when people tended to go to their local GP with ailments,\"she said. \n\n\"When I was taking calls we might take 20 in a shift. Now we're taking 80 or 90.\"\n\nCall handler Cerys Owen added:\"The highest I've seen is 26 calls waiting, that's across Wales.\"\n\nThey have noticed a spike in red calls - this can mean patients waiting longer for amber or green category calls.\n\nGill said there could be frustration for everyone at the stack of calls waiting to be dealt with - but everyone calling 999 would be able to speak to a nurse or clinician.\n\n\"We will ring them back after a time to tell them we still have their call and we haven't forgotten about them,\"she said.\n\n\"We also have to manage expectations - and will tell them if we might not get to them for an hour or two, whatever the timeframe is.\"\nTL;DR: Health boards could face fines for failing to tackle issues around the amount of time it takes ambulances to hand over patients to A&E departments.\n\nArticle: By Colette HumeBBC Wales News\n\nDarren Osborne, 48, was found guilty of murdering Makram Ali, 51, after deliberately ploughing into a crowd of people in Finsbury Park in June.\n\nHe was sentenced to a minimum 43 years in prison earlier in February.\n\nOn Sunday, 12 Welsh mosques will welcome the public, including the Dar Ul-Isra Mosque in Osborne's home city.\n\nThe annual open day also follows a YouGov poll that found 70% of Britons had never been inside another faith's place of worship and 90% had not recently been in a mosque.\n\n\"We are in a way relieved that it didn't (the attack) happen in Cardiff, he could have easily done it in Cardiff and there's a sense of guilt there,\"said Amanda Morris of the Muslim Council of Wales.\n\n\"Why did he go to London to do it, why not do it in Cardiff?\n\n\"So it's very complex how we feel about it, but at the same time it has triggered a lot of really important conversations that need to be had.\"\n\nMs Morris claimed many in the community were still dealing with\"complex emotions\"triggered by the attack in June 2017.\n\nShe added:\"Our first reaction was one of shock obviously. \n\n\"To find out it was somebody actually from Cardiff was heartbreaking for us because Muslims, we feel like our entire community is one body, so the gentleman who died and the people who were injured were part of us in a way. \n\n\"The fact that somebody from Cardiff - which is also a part of us - could have done that was very very saddening for us, but that said he could have come from anywhere.\"\n\nThe 12 Welsh mosques, including buildings in Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Wrexham, Bangor in Gwynedd and Rhyl, Denbighshire, open as part of the UK-wide Visit My Mosque event.\n\nIt hopes to show that mosques are more than just places of worship. \n\nIn the hall attached to the Dar Ul-Isra Mosque, the First Cathays Al Huda -

The last time there was a decline in September car sales was in 2011, when it fell by a mere 0.8%.\n\nTotal car sales so far in 2017 have reached 2,066,411, representing a fall of 3.9% on the same period last year.\n\nAnalysis: Theo Leggett, business correspondent:\n\nRegistrations of new cars have been declining for six months. \n\nSo far, the SMMT has been relatively sanguine about it. After all, 2016 was a record year for the industry. But now there are distinct signs that frustration is setting in.\n\nSeptember is normally a bumper month for sales, because it's when a new number plate is released and buyers like to have the very latest registrations. But clearly the showrooms aren't as crowded as they should be.\n\nCars are'big ticket' items - and when consumer confidence is low, sales fall. The SMMT thinks that's what's happening now. It says customers are putting off buying new vehicles, because they're worried about the economy.\n\nThen there's confusion over the government's clean air plans. The SMMT says that the newest petrol and diesel cars shouldn't be affected by any bans, or charges for entering cities - but consumers don't seem to be aware of the fact.\n\nCoupled with the ongoing uncertainty over what will happen to cross-border trade when we leave the EU, it's easy to see why car industry executives might be getting nervous.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said:\"Car sales remain well below last year's levels, as the inflation-driven squeeze on real incomes makes households reluctant to make major financial commitments. \n\n\"In seasonally-adjusted terms, however, we estimate that registrations were 9.7% higher in [the third quarter] than [the second quarter], when sales were hit by April's increase in vehicle excise duty.\"\n\nMr Tombs added that car sales had boosted quarter-on-quarter growth in households' spending during the July-to-September period, but were expected to drag on consumption growth for the rest of the year.\nTL;DR: Sales of new cars in the UK fell sharply in September, a move that an industry body has said will cause \"considerable concern\".\n\nArticle: The right of way, which passes within feet of the ancient circle, follows the route of the A344 which was closed to traffic and grassed over in 2013.\n\nThe path was due to open last summer but was delayed by English Heritage to allow the grass to\"fully establish\".\n\nFormer Wiltshire councillor Ian West said the path is three years overdue and was only\"very quietly opened\".\n\nThe A344 was closed by English Heritage four years ago in a bid to\"restore the dignity\"of the World Heritage Site.\n\nAs part of the agreement with Wiltshire Council, the grassed over section of the road was to be re-opened as a\"permissive path\".\n\nThe path allows visitors free access to the site without a local residents pass, but Mr West said campaigners had been\"struggling for three years to get it open\".\n\n\"This was supposed to be opened before the new visitors centre opened,\"he said.\n\n\"But there was a three-year delay waiting for the grass to grow strong enough to bear the weight of a few cyclists and pedestrians.\n\n\"Now, it's been very quietly opened but there are still misleading signs deterring people from using it.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for English Heritage, said the path, which runs from Byway 12 to Stonehenge Bottom, was opened at the end of September.\n\n\"An extension of time was granted by Wiltshire Council to allow for the re-vegetated section of the A344 to fully establish,\"she said.\n\n\"Allowing visitors, cyclists and walkers access to it any earlier would have had a damaging effect on the grass.\"\nTL;DR: A footpath which allows visitors to see Stonehenge free of charge has been opened a year behind schedule.\n\nArticle: A consortium of British business, including retailers Kingfisher and transport group, Stagecoach, say the UK must prepare for the next oil shock.\n\nIt says not to do so would present energy security problems.\n\nA barrel of oil is currently around $80 a barrel, well below the last peak of $145 two-and-a-half years ago.\n\nBut the group says a new\"peak oil threat\"is likely to be felt in the UK within the next five years.\n\nPeak oil is the point when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production enters a terminal decline. \n\nThe group, the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security (ITPOES) has produced a briefing update called Peak Oil: the implications of the Gulf of Mexico spill.\n\nIt warns that in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, tightened regulation of deep water drilling could see oil prices rise.\n\n'Horrible shocks'\n\nSir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group is among the members of the industry taskforce, said the disaster in the Gulf had increased the chances of an\"oil crunch\"in the coming decade.\n\nHe said:\"The time to take out our insurance policies against such an outcome is now.

Software experts called for the entire voting system to be rewritten to better protect data. \n\nA report looking into the success of the 2013 trial said about 70,000 Norwegians took the chance to cast an e-vote. This represented about 38% of all the 250,000 people across 12 towns and cities who were eligible to vote online. \n\nHowever, it said, there was no evidence that the trial led to a rise in the overall number of people voting nor that it mobilised new groups, such as young people, to vote. \n\nThe report by Norway's Institute of Social Research also expressed worries about the fact that online voting took place in what it called\"uncontrolled environments\". This, it said, undermined the need for a vote to be made in secret without anyone influencing the voter as they made their choice.\n\nIt said there was also some evidence that a small number of people, 0.75% of all voters, managed to vote twice in 2013. They did this by voting once online then travelling to a polling station to cast a paper ballot.\n\nNorway has made its decision soon after Jenny Watson, head of Britain's Electoral Commission, said the UK should move more swiftly to adopt e-voting as it could help arrest a decline in the numbers of young voters.\nTL;DR: Norway is ending trials of e-voting systems used in national and local elections.\n\nArticle: That statement followed the death of one person from Legionnaires' disease and 18 further cases in Stoke-on-Trent since 24 July.\n\nA hot tub displayed in a store in the town is thought to be the\"probable\"source after samples from it were found to match those taken from the patients.\n\nHot tubs or spa pools are popular in gyms, hotels and increasingly in people's back gardens - but experts say they can be a health risk if they are not looked after.\n\nThe water in hot tubs is kept at between 30 and 35 degrees, close to body temperature, which is the ideal environment for legionella bacteria to grow.\n\nThe bubbling and frothing of the aerosols in a hot tub can then throw the bacteria into the air for several yards around the tub.\n\nSo you don't have to be sitting in the hot tub to inhale the bacteria.\n\nFine spray \n\nProfessor Nick Phin, head of Legionnaires' Disease at the Health Protection Agency, says an outbreak of the disease in the Netherlands in 1999 illustrates how far the spray can travel.\n\n\"Over 140 people were affected at a Dutch flower show by two spa baths being exhibited. People were just passing through and breathing in the fine spray.\"\n\nBut not everyone who walked past the hot tubs was infected by the legionella bacterium, he says.\n\n\"You have to be susceptible to it. There was a very low attack rate of 0.2% in the Holland example.\"\n\nPeople aged over 50 are more likely to be affected, as are people with existing health problems, particularly lung damage, and those who smoke.\n\n\"If your immune system is OK then you don't tend to get it,\"says Prof Phin.\n\nCleaning and maintaining the hot tub regularly is the only way to ensure that bacteria do not concentrate in the water and the spray, he explains.\n\nAs a result, the HPA has produced guidance on how to clean hot tubs and spa pools with chemicals which disinfect the water.\n\nIn general, cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing in number over the past 30 years. In the last 10 years, HPA figures show that cases have averaged 350 each year.\n\nThere is no knowing how many of these are due to hot tubs, because of the difficulty of finding the exact source of an outbreak.\n\nAround half of cases are linked to overseas travel.\n\nBut there are some other potential problems with hot tubs if they are not maintained properly.\n\nThe amount of skin that is shed in hot tubs can lead to cases of Pseudomonal infection and some people have also had boils appear on their bodies.\n\n\"If spa pools are not looked after properly then they can cause other diseases,\"Prof Phin says.\n\nLocal authorities will carry out inspections and private owners should make sure they use the appropriate chemicals to clean tubs and disinfect the water too.\nTL;DR: Hot tubs are known to be effective mechanisms for spreading legionella infection, an official at the Health Protection Agency said this week.\n\nArticle: William Cater, 48, admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two of causing serious injury by dangerous driving in relation to the crash, near Taunton, in September 2018.\n\nRod Walsh, 54, from Cheddar, was one of those who died.\n\nCeri Walsh, who was in the car with her husband, said she was still angry.\"Why didn't he see us?\"she said.\n\n\"I'm angry that he took away two lives - ruined two lives and injured loads of other people,\"she added.\n\nJoanne Jennings, 45, from Highbridge in Somerset, was the other person who died, while five people were injured, two of them seriously.\n\nPolice said the crash between the lorry and a car\"impacted on six other vehicles in front of the car which were also queuing\".\n\nAt Taunton Crown Court, Cater was also disqualified from driving for 41 months and will be required to take an extended retest.\n\nCater, from Cirencester, pleaded guilty to the charges at an earlier hearing.\nTL;DR: A lorry driver who killed two people by driving into traffic waiting to leave the M5 has been jailed for 35 months.\n\nArticle: By Adam EastonBBC News, Warsaw\n\nThe Law and Justice Party (PiS) - eurosceptic and strong on traditional values - made a dramatic comeback in Sunday's general election.\n\nMs Szydlo, 52, has been a conservative MP for a decade. But she impressed many Poles and her party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, earlier this year by running Andrzej Duda's successful presidential campaign.\n\nA relatively unknown MEP, Mr Duda surprised almost everyone by beating the popular incumbent, Bronislaw Komorowski, in May. \n\nDuring an energetic campaign, Mr Duda travelled the country, with Mrs Szydlo by his side, meeting and listening to as many Poles as he could. Ms Szydlo's role in his success was recognised when Mr Kaczynski appointed her the party's candidate for prime minister.\n\n\"The fresh, moderate face of the Polish right. She is the hard-working, skilful and intelligent woman behind Andrzej Duda's spectacular victory in the presidential race,\"said Marek Magierowski, President Duda's public diplomacy adviser.\n\nThat\"fresh\"face is important here - it sets her apart from the governing centre-right Civic Platform which, after eight years in office, lost much support. But she also contrasts with her boss, Mr Kaczynski. \n\n'Daddy was a miner'\n\nMr Kaczynski, a 66-year-old bachelor, is a divisive figure. He is not afraid to accuse his political opponents of being on the side of the former communist police and, more recently, he warned that immigrants were bringing diseases with them from the Middle East.\n\nLed by Mr Kaczynski, Law and Justice had lost every major national election since 2007 until he stepped aside to allow Andrzej Duda to run for president this year. \n\nLike Mr Kaczynski, Ms Szydlo stresses the importance of traditional Roman Catholic family values and the need to help the many who feel they have not benefited from Poland's impressive economic growth during the past two decades. But her tone is more measured.\n\nShe was born and raised near the southern Polish coal-mining town of Brzeszcze.\"I remember my warm family home with affection,\"she writes on her webpage.\"There was no lack of support, nor discipline. My parents worked hard. Daddy was a miner,\"she said.\n\nShe says she enjoyed reading and played handball during her student days in Krakow's Jagiellonian University, where she met her husband, Edward. They have two sons. \n\nShe became the youngest mayor in Malopolska province at the age of 35, and later joined Law and Justice, where she rose to become a deputy leader.\n\n\"Never a cabinet member, she'll face a steep learning curve as prime minister.

It looked at the cases involving 2,324 adults and 147 children and whether their families had been screened. \n\nOnly 15% of hospital trusts had access to funded DNA testing, meaning an estimated that 100,000 sufferers would be left undiagnosed. \n\nThe report concluded that there was a\"major lack\"of family testing in England.  It said greater progress was being made in the rest of the UK especially Wales.\n\nThe author, Professor Steve Humphries, said:\"Undoubtedly it is cost effective to test and treat familial hypercholesterolaemia.  \n\n\"It saves lives in five to 10 years time, but trusts balance budgets by April so it is hard to get these measures high enough up the priority list.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said:\"It's frustrating and unacceptable that families at risk of familial hypercholesterolaemia aren't receiving the help and attention they deserve from the health service. \n\n\"It's long overdue that familial hypercholesterolaemia services come up to scratch to stop lives across the UK being needlessly lost.\"\n\nProfessor Humphries called for a regional or national body to be set up to manage the testing. \n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said:\"There is clear guidance and support for the NHS on managing familial hypercholesterolaemia - including guidance on testing and diagnosis. \n\n\"The Department does not routinely'ring fence' funding for the local NHS, this allows the local NHS to prioritise its funding and respond to the needs of local people.\"\nTL;DR: About 100,000 patients have not been tested for a preventable form of heart disease in the UK, according to an audit of the NHS.\n\nArticle: By Imran Rahman-JonesNewsbeat reporter\n\nThat's not an especially well-known name - the President's adviser is a 31-year-old former model who likes to keep under the radar.\n\nHope Hicks replaced Anthony Scaramucci as the President's communications director when he was fired after 10 days in 2017.\n\nShe didn't have a background in politics, but had been connected to the Trump family for the preceding five years.\n\nSo how did someone with such a low profile get one of the most important jobs in the US government?\n\nShe came to Donald through Ivanka Trump\n\nHope Hicks started her career in public relations, where Ivanka Trump's fashion company was one of her clients.\n\nHaving modelled for the likes of Ralph Lauren - as well as appearing on the cover of a Gossip Girl spin-off book - she modelled some of Ivanka's clothes as part of her job.\n\nWorking with the eldest daughter of Donald Trump meant Hope Hicks eventually caught the eye of the US president.\n\nHe personally hand-picked her in October 2014 to work in PR for his real estate company. \n\nDonald Trump later told GQ that he thought\"Hope was outstanding\".\n\nShe ended up in politics by accident\n\nIn early 2015, she was thrust into the political sphere when she went with Donald Trump on a trip, which turned out to be the first part of his presidential campaign.\n\nShe even helped run his Twitter account, noting down what he wanted to say and ordering others in the Trump organisation to tweet them.\n\nWhen the campaign got more serious, she had to decide between becoming a full-time political press secretary or going back to work for the Trump real estate company.\n\nShe chose the latter. But again, Donald Trump personally asked her to stay on his political team. She accepted.\n\nShe's kept a low profile throughout\n\nHope Hicks rarely gives interviews herself, although she has been there when Donald Trump is interviewed by journalists. \n\nAnd when she started working on the presidential campaign, she deleted her Twitter account. Her Instagram profile is private.\n\nThis quote which her former lacrosse coach gave to the Washington Post sums up her attitude well.\n\n\"[Hicks] preferred to have assists. She was the ultimate team player and competitor.\"\n\nWhen Donald Trump became president, he created a new role for Hope Hicks: White House director of strategic communications.\n\nHer way of dealing with the president is not to try and change him, but to simply enable him in what he wants to do.\n\nAccording to a Politico article, Hope Hicks is one of the few true insiders in the Trump family, even having Shabbat dinners (special meals in the Jewish faith) with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. \n\nShe was also one of the few people who got to meet the Pope with Donald Trump in May 2017.\n\nOut of the White House... and back in again\n\nHope Hicks resigned in February 2018, one day after she testified to Congress that she occasionally told white lies on Mr Trump's behalf.\n\nIn the interim she worked for Fox News, but returned to the President's team earlier this year.\n\nAccording to BBC White House reporter Tara McKelvey at the time, the reason was simple.\"she said little, yet seemed to know the president's secrets\".\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

The latest incentive is in the central Aichi Prefecture, where a company that runs 89 funeral homes is offering a 15% discount for those who give up their licences, Kyodo news service reports. \n\nAnyone wanting to take advantage of it has to provide evidence that they have handed in their licence at the local police station, which is supporting the initiative. The discount can be extended to family members, including those who live outside the prefecture, the report says. \n\nIn 2015, there were almost 4.8 million licence holders over the age of 75, according to The Japan Times, twice as many as a decade earlier. The same period saw an increase in the number of fatal collisions involving elderly drivers.\n\nSimilar incentive-based schemes are operating elsewhere in Japan, although most aren't quite so morbid - some involve cheaper taxi rides or cut-price entry to public baths. The funeral home initiative is also quite a contrast to another offer announced in Aichi in November, whereby elderly locals could tuck into cut-price noodles if they surrendered their driving licences.\n\nNext story: Dictionary altered to thwart exam cheats\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.\nTL;DR: Elderly drivers in Japan are being offered discounts on funeral services if they agree to surrender their licences, it's reported.\n\nArticle: A \u00a343m plan to demolish the Druids Heath blocks to make way for 250 homes, were described as akin to\"social cleansing\", by residents.\n\nThey also said their wishes had been ignored by the city council.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday council leader Ian Ward said the plan will be stopped while it works with the community on a solution.\n\nResidents said they hoped the council would be\"true to their words\".\n\nHillcroft, Kingswood, Barratts and Saxelby tower blocks were set to be demolished along with Brookpiece tower, while residents had already left Heath House and been dispersed across the city in preparation for its demolition. \n\nResidents said they still want the blocks brought down, but were angry that they felt they had no input in the scheme, and were concerned there would not be enough social housing for some people to return.\n\nAnalysis: Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC Radio WM political reporter\n\nThe message at the public meeting was clear. You've ignored us. \n\nOne woman said she felt as though Druid's Heath was being treated like'council fodder' - another said the plans would rip the heart out of a community. \n\nThe main concerns fall into two categories - that proper provision hasn't been made to temporarily house residents nearby whilst work is under way, and that there won't be enough social housing to come back to.\n\nIt's very unusual for a council leader to talk about ripping up the plan and starting again but it was clear the blame was being laid at the door of officers for failing to communicate adequately with residents. \n\nBut it was made clear any new plan has to be looked at in the context of the existing budget.

It would, backers said, reduce red tape and cut the costs of running a business.\n\n'Petri-dish of fraud'\n\nThe bill has been largely welcomed by start-up companies looking to secure vital funding in a year when lending by US banks is expected to drop.\n\nMichael Lipton, founder of digital firm Breakfast, told the BBC the measures meant a wider array of businesses could be created.\n\n\"If someone believes in an idea and believes in a company's strategic vision, they should be able to put their capital behind it,\"he said.\n\nHowever Jesse Eisinger, a finance reporter for the US news website ProPublica, described the proposals as a\"petri-dish of fraud\", and dismissed pledges it would lead to significant job creation.\n\n\"It's a bad deal for the retail investor,\"he told the BBC.\n\n\"They're going to get solicitations online, they're going to be asked for small investments.\n\n\"The only jobs that are really going to benefit from this are fraudsters, shills and Wall Street analysts.\"\nTL;DR: Raising money for start-ups via the internet is set to become easier after a new bill was backed by the US House of Representatives.\n\nArticle: Work on the Sandbanks Ferry, which links Swanage and Poole, is expected to last until October.\n\nStudland Parish Council said residents wanted to\"break the monopoly held by the ferry company\".\n\nIt said it hoped the ferry's right to operate would be overturned by an act of Parliament. \n\nFairacres Group, which runs the ferry, said it had been\"struggling\"to hire a stand-in vessel.\n\n'Rather fed up'\n\nThe Bramble Bush Bay was taken out of service on 12 July after its drive shaft broke. With the ferry not running the four-minute crossing, people face a 25-mile (40km) diversion.\n\nParish council vice-chairman Nick Boulter said many attending the meeting on Wednesday were\"visibly quite distressed\".\n\nHe said:\"It's having a really bad impact on businesses. They could offer to run an alternative service.\"\n\nMr Boulter said Essex-based Fairacres Group was given\"no performance standards at all so they can do what they like\".\n\n\"Accounts show that Fairacres have invested \u00a323m in their hotel business over the last seven years, but little in the ferry,\"he added.\n\nHe said he had written to the Department for Transport in the hope of overturning the company's right to operate, which was first granted by an Act of Parliament in 1923.\n\nThe ferry was suspended for nearly three months last winter due to annual maintenance and then a hydraulic issue.  It only ran on two days between 29 October and 28 January.\n\nFairacres Group applied for a tolls revision order claiming it needed the rise to fund a new vessel, but the secretary of state for transport refused the bid in December.\n\nIn a statement, the firm said it was\"struggling\"to hire a stand-in ferry due to\"a number of reasons including mainly but not limited to strong tides and inappropriate landing facilities\".\nTL;DR: A ferry operator should lose its right to operate the service which has been put out of action for three months, a parish council has said.\n\nArticle: Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Turkey\"likely intends\"to extend its attack further than originally planned.\n\nThe assault is aimed at forcing out Kurdish forces - the main US ally in the area. They may be seeking help from Syria and Russia, said Mr Esper, and the US would not be defending them.\n\nLater the Kurds said they had agreed Syria would deploy troops in the area.\n\nSyrian state TV had already announced the army was heading north to confront Turkish forces.\n\nMore than 130,000 people have fled homes near the conflict, the UN said, warning the figure could soon triple.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Kurdish-led fighters under attack from Turkey, warned last week that they would no longer be able to guard suspected IS members and their families in camps and prisons under their control if the Turkish offensive continued.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Kurdish officials said nearly 800 relatives of foreign IS members had escaped from Ain Issa, a camp in the north, as clashes raged nearby.\n\nThe Turkish offensive, which started last week, has drawn an international outcry, as the SDF were the main Western allies in the battle against IS in Syria. \n\nBut Turkey views the Kurdish groups within the force as terrorists and says it wants to drive them away from a\"safe zone\"reaching 30km into Syria. \n\nIt plans to resettle more than three million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey within the zone - many of whom are not Kurds. Critics have warned this could lead to ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population. \n\nWhat's behind the US troops decision?\n\nThe situation in Syria is becoming\"very untenable\", US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we learned that the Turks likely intend to extend their attack further south than originally planned, and to the west,\"he told CBS's Face the Nation.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday the aim of the incursion was to establish a\"security zone\"that would extend from Kobane in the west to Hassakeh in the east, about 30km deep into Syrian territory. \n\nWhile he said this was\"in line\"with the safe zone map originally proposed, Hassakeh lies more than 70km away from the Turkish border.\n\nMr Esper said the decision to withdraw the nearly 1,000 US troops from northern Syria was made after discussions with his national security team and US President Donald Trump. \n\nHe was unable to give a timeframe for the withdrawal and did not specify where the troops would be moved to next.\n\nAccording to him, the SDF are\"looking to cut a deal\"with the Syrian government and its Russian allies to counter the Turkish attack. \n\nThis, he said, would leave the US forces stuck between\"two opposing advancing armies\".\n\nHours after his comments, the Syrian army was reported by state media to have been deployed to the north to\"confront a Turkish aggression\"on Syrian territory. It is not yet clear where exactly the troops are being sent.\n\nPresident Trump's decision last week to move some of his troops from pockets in the north-east of Syria effectively paved the way for the Turkish operation against the Kurdish fighters, who have lost the protection of their US allies. \n\nOn Sunday, he tweeted that it was\"very smart\"not to be involved in the fighting\"for a change\".\n\nThe US defence secretary's announcement of a\"deliberate withdrawal\"of US troops from northern Syria underscores the pace at which the situation on the ground is deteriorating. \n\nAmid heavy fighting, wayward shelling, alleged war crimes, and reports of IS supporters breaking out from camps and holding centres, Washington has clearly decided it cannot stand against Turkey's determination to see this operation through. \n\nInterestingly, Mark Esper also noted that in the past 24 hours the US had learned that the Turks\"likely intended to expand their attack further south than originally planned and to the west\". \n\nThis is clearly what is seen as threatening US forces, and it risks additional humanitarian suffering and the escape of more IS fighters. \n\nHis reference to the largely-Kurdish SDF forces seeking alliances with the Syrian regime and Russia - Syria's main backer and a major player in the conflict - illustrates that the regional ramifications of this crisis are becoming ever more dangerous.\n\nWhat's the latest?\n\nTurkey is pushing deeper into northern Syria. \n\nOn Sunday, President Erdogan said his forces had already captured 109 sq km (42 square miles) of territory, including 21 villages.\n\nHe told reporters the key border town of Ras al-Ain had come under Turkish control - though the SDF said they had pushed Turkish forces back to the town's outskirts. \n\nMr Erdogan said Turkish forces had also besieged the town of Tal Abyad, some 120km (75 miles) away.\n\nThe UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Turkey was in almost complete control there.\n\nBoth Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad are key goals in the Turkish offensive against the Kurdish-led SDF forces.\n\nTurkey also announced that its Syrian allies on the ground had seized a key motorway - called M4 - some 30-35km south of the border.\n\nWhat are the casualty figures?\n\nThey're rising, with civilians killed on both sides of the border:\n\nWhat about IS?\n\nThe fighting has spilled over to areas close to IS detainee camps, and there are fears the Kurdish forces will be unable to keep them in check. \n\nOn Sunday, Kurdish officials at the Ain Issa camp said nearly 800 relatives of foreign IS members had escaped, as clashes raged nearby.\n\nThe SOHR said the number of people who fled was 100. It not known where they have fled to.\n\nThe camp holds about 12,000 displaced people, previously including nearly 1,000 foreign women and children with jihadist links.\n\nThe SDF says it is currently holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border.\n\nIS has claimed recent car bombings and on Saturday declared a new campaign in Syria, which it said was to avenge its members' detention in Kurdish-run prisons.\n\nTurkey says it will take responsibility for IS prisoners it finds during its offensive.\nTL;DR: The US is pulling out all of its troops from northern Syria as Turkey advances its operation against the Kurds.\n\nArticle: In a statement which included plans for fixed-term parliaments, he said UK democracy was\"fractured\", with some votes counting more than others.\n\nHe also changed the number of MPs required to vote to dissolve Parliament from 55% to 66%, after heavy criticism.\n\nLabour attacked boundary changes as\"gerrymandering\".\n\n'Uniquely placed'\n\nIn a wide-ranging statement, Mr Clegg confirmed the government planned to introduce legislation for five-year fixed term parliaments and to hold a referendum next May on changing the Westminster voting system from first-past-the-post to the Alternative Vote (AV), where candidates are ranked in order of preference.\n\nIf plans get through Parliament, it would mean the next general election would be held on 7 May 2015 and the number of MPs would be reduced by 50 to 600.\n\nThe Boundary Commission would be asked to redraw the constituency map, so each has roughly the same number of voters, by the end of 2013 - allowing new constituencies to be used in the 2015 general election.\n\nNew constituencies would be set within 5% of a target quota of registered voters - apart from in Orkney and Shetland and the Western Isles which were\"uniquely placed given their locations\"- something welcomed by the Scottish National Party.\n\nMr Clegg told MPs:\"Together, these proposals help correct the deep unfairness in the way we hold elections in this country. \n\n\"Under the current set-up, votes count more in some parts of the country than others, and millions feel that their votes don't count at all. Elections are won and lost in a small minority of seats.\n\n\"We have a fractured democracy, where some people's votes count and other people's votes don't count.\"\n\nBoundary changes\n\nThe proposal to\"equalise\"constituencies was in the Conservative manifesto - while the Lib Dems are committed to changing the voting system.\n\nThe coalition deal between the two parties saw an agreement for a referendum on changing the voting system to AV, but Tory MPs will be able to campaign against a change.\n\nBut Labour, which had also planned a referendum on switching to AV, attacked plans to link the referendum with proposed boundary changes and reducing the number of MPs, something Mr Clegg said would save \u00a312m a year. \n\nShadow justice secretary Jack Straw said he backed a referendum on AV but added:\"What we are not going to allow is for that support to be used as some kind of cover for outrageously partisan proposals in the same Bill to gerrymander the boundaries of this House of Commons by arbitrarily changing the rules for settling boundaries and by an equally arbitrary cut in the number of MPs.\"\n\nHe argued there was a\"huge problem\"of 3.5 million people who were eligible to vote but not on the electoral register - to which Mr Clegg hit back that Labour had done nothing about it for 13 years.\n\nOther Labour MPs also stood up to complain that plans to change the constituency boundaries amounted to\"gerrymandering\".\n\n'Synthetic fury'\n\nBut Mr Clegg accused them of\"synthetic fury\"on the issue, adding:\"Members on all sides will see the proposal to cap the number of MPs at 600 is a sensible one.\"\n\nTory MPs were also annoyed at the prospect of a referendum on AV being held on the same day as elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which they argued would\"skew\"the result because turnout would differ across the UK. Plaid Cymru, the DUP and SNP have also complained about the date.\n\nCampaign group Unlock Democracy welcomed the plans for a referendum on AV and for fixed-term parliaments. Spokeswoman Alexandra Runswick said:\"These new proposals are stronger than those initially announced and far more likely to stand the test of time.\"\n\nMr Clegg also announced he was changing plans on giving MPs the power to dissolve Parliament before the fixed term is expired, following heavy criticism by Labour and some Tory MPs.\n\nThe power is linked to the coalition government's plans to introduce five-year fixed term parliaments, under which the prime minister would lose the power to dissolve parliament at a time of his or her choosing.\n\nThe government had said the threshold for dissolving Parliament would be 55% - high enough to stop either of the governing parties triggering an election without the other.\n\nBut both parties together have just over 56% of MPs and would still have been able to whip their MPs to trigger a dissolution.\n\nMr Clegg said they had\"listened carefully\"to MPs' concerns and had raised the threshold to two thirds, or 66% - the threshold used in the Scottish Parliament - which he said would make it impossible for any government to\"force a dissolution for its own purposes\". \n\nAnd he stressed that the existing threshold for a no-confidence vote would remain as a simple majority of 50% plus one. \n\nIf a government lost a confidence vote, and no new government could be formed within 14 days, Parliament would automatically dissolve and a general election would be called, he said - insisting the changes would\"strengthen parliament's power over the executive\".\n\nFor Labour, Mr Straw said it was\"the first major U-turn of this government and in less than two months\".\nTL;DR: Deputy PM Nick Clegg has unveiled plans to have fewer MPs and hold a referendum on the voting system before the next election. \n\n\n\nArticle: A court has ruled that Stone serve the rest of his sentence for the 1988 Milltown Cemetery attack.\n\nStone had served 12 years of a 30-year term for the three murders at Milltown and three other sectarian killings.\n\nHe had been released on licence as part of the Good Friday Agreement but was jailed again for trying to kill Sinn Fein leaders at Stormont in 2006.\n\nStone was jailed for 16 years for the attempted murders of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and other offences including possessing explosives.\n\nThe convicted killer had claimed to have been engaged in an act of performance art when he went to Stormont on the day Ian Paisley and Mr McGuinness were due to be nominated as Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers.\n\nHe was armed with knives, an axe, garrotte and a flight bag containing explosive fireworks, flammable liquids, a butane gas canister and fuses.\n\nStone, who suffers from hereditary motor neuropathy, was overpowered after trying to ignite the bag and throw it into the main foyer.\n\nIn 1988, Stone launched a gun and grenade attack on the Belfast funeral of three IRA members shot dead by British special forces in Gibraltar.\n\nThree mourners - Thomas McErlean, John Murray and Kevin Brady - were killed and more than 50 injured.\n\nStone was also convicted of the murders of three other Catholic men - Patrick Brady, Kevin McPolin and Dermot Hackett - between 1984 and 1987. \n\nMonday's court decision means the 58-year-old may not even be considered for release until March 2018.\n\nSpeaking in the court, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said of the murders:\"There are serious aggravating factors.

The journey was his way of reconnecting with the countryside following a period living in the capital.\n\nThe pictures are snaps of the road, yet the passage of a hundred years of history changes our perception of them. The last breath of a country about to change forever, or a romantic wish for something lost, perhaps.\n\n\"The power of this tale lies in its moment in history, Easter 1913, just before the outbreak of World War One,\"says Hudson.\n\n\"While there were suspicions of war, Thomas was certainly unaware of the terrible tragedy that was about to engulf the world.\"\n\nThomas himself would be killed at the Battle of Arras on 9 April 1917 - Easter Monday - just a few months after arriving in France. His death was all the more tragic as he was not required to sign up, being 37 years old and married.

Five years on, the difference is that they can all vote now - as voting age is 21.\n\nBut the numbers of those who have chosen not to register might tell a different story.  According to Malaysia's Election Commission, as many as 3.8m eligible voters did not register in time for this election - and two-thirds of them are in their 20s.\n\n If this is genuine lack of interest, it is reflected in one poll by Merdeka Centre, an independent Malaysian polling organisation which last year looked at how young people in West Malaysia felt about politics. \n\nThey found that as many as 70% of them do not believe that their vote will bring about tangible changes in the government and don't think their elected representatives really care about people like them. \n\nYoung people felt disenfranchised and the high cost of living, low wages and unemployment didn't help matters.  \n\n\"I don't know much but I only care a little bit because our economy sucks, there's inflation and I don't want to end up in poverty,\"22-year-old student Alya Aziz told the BBC.  Ms Aziz is one of those not registered to vote. \n\nLeonie Leong, 27, told the BBC that she was keen to vote but registered too late for this election, admitting that registering was never high up on her to-do list.\n\n\"I know it's bad to think this way, that my vote won't count for anything other than the popular vote and the popular vote doesn't win anything.\"\n\nAnother issue is that for many youth their knowledge and experience of politics is confined to social media: which they regard with a mixture of fascination and mistrust. \n\nLow Chi-e, 25, also registered too late but says:\"Based on my own experience, knowledge of politics for those who do not actively search for it is limited to social media, which in turn, is limited to those you choose to include in your social circle. In other words, if you know no one who cares about politics, you're susceptible to living under a rock\".\n\nMany analysts say this stems from a system that actively discourages youth from discussing politics, especially on university campuses. \n\nAt University Malaya, one of Malaysia's top public universities, for example, you wouldn't be able to tell that national elections are only days away. \n\nOutside the university's gates, election fever is palpable with multicoloured flags lining the streets and fences - but on campus things are so quiet you wouldn't be able to tell elections are just days away. \n\nStudents at the university, such as Nur Hanifah, 22, and Nurul Syazwani, 23, say political discussions, or organisations, are a rarity on campus.\n\n\"Among students there are discussions but never in a formal setting, just amongst ourselves,\"Nur Hanifah says.\n\nThis is in part due to the Universities and University Colleges Act - legislation that governs all public universities in Malaysia. \n\nThe act is focused on outlining the administrative powers of universities - but, up until 2012, a clause prohibited public university students from participating in any form of political activity. \n\nA set of amendments changed this, enabling students to participate in political activities so long as it is with a legitimate political party. \n\nBut observers say the amendment remains restrictive. \n\n\"Make no mistake...The amendments do not go far enough,\"lawyer Syahredzan Johan told the BBC. \n\n\"The law allows students to be involved and participate in political parties, but not organisations which the university deems to be'detrimental to the interest of the University'. This is restrictive and undemocratic,\"he said, adding that such organisations could include grassroots bodies like Bersih, an electoral reform group.\n\nVoon Zhen Yi, a research analyst at the Centre for Public Policy Studies, believes the rise of social media has in fact allowed students to directly engage with politicians and political groups.\n\n\"In the past if students wanted more information about politics, they would find it quite a challenge to get that.\"\n\nHe adds that although the age gap between voters and their elected representatives mean many feel disconnected, there is some cause for hope if only because campaigning is in full swing.  \n\n\"Youth are getting quite interested because of the marketing, it's quite hard to escape election fever,\"he said. \n\nAsmaliza Romlee, 32,  says\"because I'm older, I realise you have to vote because if you want country to change you must participate in the process\". \n\nBut the realities of Malaysian politics, so strongly rooted in racial and religious agendas, just does not feel relevant to some young voters.\n\n\"I don't see any candidate that represents my beliefs about environmentalism, urban poverty, socio-economic issues, those kinds of things.\"Ms Asmaliza says. \n\n\"Overseas you have young leaders. In New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is 37-years-old and in Canada they have Justin Trudeau. I hope to see all this in Malaysia in the next 10 years.\"\nTL;DR: When Malaysia goes to the polls next week, millennials could wield the most power at the ballot box. But what about the large number of young people who didn't even register? The BBC turned to the numbers - and the youth - to see if they understand and or even care about their influence.\n\nArticle: The retailer is also cancelling orders for its Spring and Summer clothing lines and won't pay costs towards them.\n\nNew Look told the BBC it did not take the decision lightly.\"This is a matter of survival,\"it told suppliers.\n\nOne small firm said New Look\u2019s behaviour was \u201ctotally out of order\u201d.\n\n'Challenges'\n\nThe supplier, which provides clothing for several High Street chains and did not want its name published, told the BBC it was not currently owed money by New Look and had no outstanding orders with the retailer.\n\nHowever, it added that New Look\u2019s approach would \u201cdevastate smaller companies down the supply chain at a time when they need help the most\u201d.\n\nNew Look\u2019s instructions to suppliers came in the form of a letter, signed by chief executive Nigel Oddy and dated 2 April, which has been seen by the BBC.\n\nAll New Look stores have been closed since 21 March.

We greatly value our relationships with suppliers and are actively identifying opportunities where they can hold product for use for autumn-winter this year or spring-summer next year.\"\nTL;DR: New Look says it is suspending payments to suppliers for existing stock \"indefinitely\", telling them in a letter that the stock can be collected by its owners.\n\nArticle: She told activists in Bangor that Plaid Cymru offers voters a\"ray of hope\". \n\nMs Wood claimed that an\"emboldened\"Conservative government would be a threat to jobs and public services. \n\nPlaid currently has three MPs.

If the ceasefire does survive, that is going to make implementing any plans for a coordinated US-Russian air campaign against IS that much harder. \n\nHow the Americans explained the attack\n\nUS Central Command said the coalition believed it was attacking IS positions and the raids were\"halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military\".\n\nIt said the\"Combined Air Operations Center had earlier informed Russian counterparts of the upcoming strike\".\n\nThe strike and circumstances surrounding it will be reviewed it said,\"to see if any lessons can be learned\".\n\nAustralian aircraft also took part in the bombing. Its Department of Defence offered its condolences to the families of government soldiers killed or wounded.\n\nResponse to the US account\n\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman has been quoted as saying that the attack showed\"that the White House is defending Islamic State\".\n\nSyria's foreign ministry said it was\"planned and deliberate\"and suggested\"pre-coordination between IS and the US forces\".\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported the strikes had killed at least 90 soldiers.\n\nOnly if the current ceasefire - which began on Monday - holds for seven days, will the US and Russia begin co-ordinated action against the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham group, which was previously known as the al-Nusra Front, and IS.\n\nThere have been no previous confirmed cases of US air strikes targeting Syrian troops. Last December, Syria accused the coalition of attacking a government army camp in Deir al-Zour but the US denied it.\n\nRussia's military had already expressed fears for the ceasefire. It said rebel groups had increased attacks and it urged the US to act or be responsible for the collapse of the truce.\n\nGeneral Viktor Poznikhir said:\"Our repeated messages to the American side are left without a response. There is doubt that the US is able to influence the moderate opposition they control.\"\n\nThe terms require moderate rebel groups to separate themselves from jihadists.\n\nA US National Security Council spokesman later said the cessation was\"broadly holding\"despite\"challenges on both sides\".\n\nThe deal was meant to allow the safe passage of aid to besieged areas of Syria, but some 20 trucks have been waiting in Turkey since Monday, unable to travel to rebel-held east Aleppo.\n\nThe Syrian truce\n\nHow will the new Syria truce work?\nTL;DR: A US-led air attack in eastern Syria that killed dozens of government troops fighting so-called Islamic State has endangered an already shaky ceasefire deal, Russia says.\n\nArticle: By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nEU law required members to tax tampons and sanitary towels at 5%, treating period products as non-essential.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak committed to scrapping the tax in his March Budget.\n\nCampaigners welcomed the end to what they called a\"sexist tax\"with activist Laura Coryton saying it was\"about ending a symptom of sexism\".\n\nThe UK was able to get rid of the tax now because it is no longer subject to European Union rules on sanitary products.\n\nThe EU is itself in the process of abolishing the tampon tax. In 2018 the European Commission published proposals to change the VAT rules, which would give countries the right to stop taxing tampons and other period products, but the move has not yet been agreed by all members. The Republic of Ireland has zero VAT on sanitary products as the rate was in place prior to EU legislation imposing the 5% minimum VAT rate on EU members. \n\nMs Coryton, 27, who began campaigning to end the tampon tax when she was 21, told the BBC the move\"challenged the negative message that this tax sent to society about women\".\n\nThe move follows Scotland becoming the first in the world to make period products free in November. \n\nFelicia Willow, chief executive of women's rights charity the Fawcett Society, agreed, saying:\"It's been a long road to reach this point, but at last the sexist tax that saw sanitary products classed as non-essential, luxury items can be consigned to the history books.\"\n\nThe Treasury has estimated the move will save the average woman nearly \u00a340 over her lifetime, with a cut of 7p on a pack of 20 tampons and 5p on 12 pads.\n\nIt's been a long road to getting the tampon tax abolished in the UK. Campaigning and debates in parliament by then-MP for Dewsbury Ann Taylor led to the Labour government moving sanitary products to a reduced rate of 5% from January 2001- the lowest rate possible under the EU's VAT rules.\n\nAnd following more campaigning in 2014 by Ms Coryton and lobbying in parliament by former Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff in 2016, the Conservative government announced that all VAT collected on sanitary products would henceforth be given to charities working with vulnerable women and girls.\n\nAt the same time, the government enshrined in legislation that it would abolish the tampon tax.\n\n\"I'm just so happy and relieved and excited at the same time for this tax to finally be axed,\"said Ms Coryton.\n\n\"It will mean a reduction in prices for period products, and that reduction in cost will be important for the increasing number of people who are battling with poverty, especially due to the pandemic.\"\n\nFree period products in school\n\nGemma Abbott is a lawyer and campaigner with the Free Periods group, which successfully campaigned for the government to provide free sanitary products to schools and colleges across England in 2019. The scheme launched in January. \n\n\"I think it's great news and a real testament to the determined campaigning of many people, like Paula Sheriff and Laura Coryton,\"she said.\n\n\"I think we can agree that any tax that characterises period products as non-essential is absurd and it has no place in a society that is seeking genuine gender equality.\"\n\nFree Periods is now campaigning to ensure that schools and colleges know that the free sanitary products scheme exists and that they sign up for them. \n\nMs Abbott said:\"The latest statistics we have are from last term - at that point only 40% of schools had signed up for the scheme.\"\n\nCombating the'stigma' of periods\n\nMs Coryton has set up a social enterprise called Sex Ed Matters with her sister Julia, providing talks in schools and toolkits for teachers to help them deliver the mandatory new sex education curriculum for primary and secondary schools issued in early 2020.\n\nThey did an online survey of 150 teachers and students across the UK, and 100% of respondents said that there is still a stigma attached to periods.\n\n\"If there is a stigma attached to periods, then you're unlikely to speak up when you need period products, or to talk about the free sanitary products scheme that exists,\"stressed Ms Coryton.\n\nBut Free Periods' Ms Abbott is also concerned about the charities supporting women and girls, who will no longer benefit from the proceeds of the previous 5% tax on sanitary products.\n\n\"The tampon tax fund has provided much needed support and funding to a chronically underfunded area,\"she said.\n\n\"I'm worried that the removal of the tampon tax will spell the end of the ring-fenced funding for charities to address really vital issues like domestic violence and rape.\"\nTL;DR: The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the \"tampon tax\" - will be abolished in the UK from 1 January.\n\nArticle: The cocker spaniels and cockapoos, some of them less than six weeks old, were taken from Just Dogz in Upwell, Norfolk, between 02:00 and 02:30 BST. \n\nOwner Justine Watts, who lives on site, said:\"It's not about the money, it's knowing they're safe. The puppies were not ready to leave their mothers.\"\n\nNorfolk Police said anyone offered puppies for sale should contact them.\n\nMrs Watts said her son was woken at 04:00 by the frantic cocker spaniel mother pacing outside their bungalow in New Road.\n\n\"He went outside to see where she had come from and realised her puppies had gone,\"she said.\n\n\"She was running around on her own outside, right next to a main road.\"\n\nThe seven puppies - four cocker spaniels and three cockapoos - were six weeks and five and a half weeks old respectively.\n\n\"They need another week of their mother's milk,\"Mrs Watts added.\n\nAll seven puppies were due to go to new homes, with deposits secured and new owners expected to pay\"quite a bit over \u00a31,000\"each, she said.\n\nNone of the adult dogs, a male cocker spaniel, two six-month-old female cocker spaniels and four adult female cocker spaniels, were related to each other or the puppies.\n\nMrs Watts said she thought the kennels had been targeted by\"somebody who knew the set up\", because the break-in was not at the entrance to the kennels close to the bungalow.\n\nPolice have said inquiries are ongoing.\nTL;DR: Fourteen dogs and puppies potentially worth thousands of pounds have been stolen from breeding kennels.\n\nArticle: By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News\n\nThe laboratory where graphene was discovered looks just like you hope a top scientist's lab will look.\n\nIn the corner, a large steel vat with the word\"cryogenics\"on the side has frothing gases flowing from its spout, looking like it may have been bought second-hand when Top of the Pops was taken off air.\n\nThere are banks of electronic modules with flashing red digital displays and wires winding from one to the next.\n\nDown the road, people are dressed head-to-toe in protective clothing and bathed in artificial yellow light as they peer through goggles into microscopes.\n\nIt is tempting to assume that Professor Konstantin Novoselov will complete the picture by entering in a lab coat and with zany white hair.\n\nBut the Russian-born boffin, personable but unassuming in jeans and a grey jumper, is no mad scientist. He is one of the two brilliant graphene pioneers who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010.\n\nTheir discovery was a very thin form of carbon, a single atom thick, which is apparently 100 times stronger than steel and conducts electricity better than copper. It will supposedly revolutionise our lives.\n\nProf Novoselov - known as Kostya - is also an art lover. So when he was asked to work with Cornelia Parker, one of Britain's most acclaimed artists, he says he\"jumped on it immediately\".\n\nIt was in these University of Manchester labs that the pair came up with the idea of taking tiny fragments of graphite from the pencil lead on drawings by Blake, Turner, Picasso and Constable and turning them into graphene.\n\n\"She had this vision that we can bring back to life the old drawings of the old masters,\"Prof Novoselov says.\n\n\"Of course that possibility's only once in a lifetime, to get my hands on the old masters, and probably correct a few things which they did wrong.\n\n\"I picked a few specks of graphite from there and turned it into graphene.\"\n\nProf Novoselov has a glint in his eye when he suggests that he has removed a few pencil strokes to\"correct\"these great artists' mistakes.\n\nThe amount of graphite he actually removed was minute.\"You would never know that there has been anything taken from those drawings,\"he adds in case anyone did not get his little joke.\n\n\"I work with pieces of graphite that are sub-100 microns (0.1mm), so you would never notice those with the naked eye.\"\n\nThe drawings he took graphite from include William Blake's Study for Tiriel Denouncing his Sons and Daughters (1789).\n\nThe graphene he extracted from that picture has now been used to make a sensor that will trigger a firework display at the nearby Whitworth gallery on Friday.\n\nThe firework display has been designed by Parker, who has added bits of meteorite from Arizona to the fireworks to make a sort of meteor shower.\n\n\"I'm re-enacting the meteor's fall in a firework display,\"says Parker.\n\nParker was inspired by Blake's poem America: A Prophecy, in which he wrote of\"flam'd red meteors\"and\"terrible wandering comets\".\n\n\"He's very biblical in his proselytations about the firmament, and so somehow this firework display is going to be a Blakeian firework display,\"she explains.\n\nLike the lab, the Whitworth is owned by the University of Manchester. As well as arranging the fireworks, Parker is exhibiting at the Whitworth as part of its reopening line-up.\n\nThe gallery has been shut for redevelopment since September 2013 and will reopen to the public on Saturday, having doubled in size and gained a new wing and an\"art garden\"in the neighbouring Whitworth Park.\n\nParker is a former Turner Prize nominee and was the only living artist in the top 10 after a survey to find the most popular British artworks in 2013.\n\nLong before dabbling in graphene, she made her name by examining, dismantling and playing around with familiar objects before allowing us to look at them anew.\n\nShe crushed silver with a steamroller, enlisted the British Army to blow up a garden shed, made a magnified image of a hole in a pin cushion made by Charlotte Bronte and microscopic portraits of the chalk crystals in Einstein's equations.\n\nThe Einstein work was made while she was artist in residence at the Science Museum. There is now talk of her doing a residency at Cern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, in Switzerland.\n\n'Genius' ideas\n\n\"Artists and scientists are very close,\"Parker says.\"They always have been, but I think we've just been divided out over the last few centuries into specialisms.\n\n\"Leonardo da Vinci was drawing helicopters and all kinds of things. We're artificially divided. I think we're closer than we think we are.\"\n\nArtists and scientists both rely on curiosity, willingness to learn and imagination, Prof Novoselov believes.\n\n\"Artists and scientists both think outside the box,\"he continues.\"They've got to come with genius experiments or ideas to expose the most interesting phenomena.\n\n\"Later, they've got to diverge a little bit because scientists will start to look at the common elements between many of the phenomena to describe the most general law, and artists will probably try to study individuals rather than the crowd as a whole.\n\n\"But we're just two sides of the same medal.\"\nTL;DR: One of Britain's leading artists has teamed up with a Nobel Prize-winning physicist to turn fragments of drawings by William Blake, JMW Turner and Pablo Picasso into the so-called \"wonder material\" graphene. \n\nThe fruits of Cornelia Parker and Professor Konstantin Novoselov's experiments in art and science will reopen the Whitworth art gallery in Manchester on Friday after a \u00a315m expansion.\n\nArticle: Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter\n\nThere will be no safety net; Ireland will gradually fund itself from the markets.\"We are confident we are making a clean exit.\"says Finance Minister Michael Noonan.\"We are not junk. We are doing well.\"\n\nSo Ireland will be the first of the bailed-out countries to step free from its economy being overseen by the troika - the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. \n\nThere will be quiet satisfaction in the corridors of Brussels and Berlin. They will grasp the moment as providing evidence that the medicine of bailouts, austerity and reforming labour markets can work. In their frequent praise for Ireland they can scarcely disguise their gratitude. \n\nNation's'shame'\n\nIt is worth recalling the mood in Ireland back in November 2010. The Irish government had rescued reckless banks, taken on their debts, and was struggling to finance itself. Dublin created a\"war room\"to fight off the humiliation of a bailout.  Sunday, 21 November was the reckoning. Ireland accepted an 85bn-euro (\u00a371bn; $117bn) rescue. \n\nWith the bailout came a national shudder, with the Irish Times, in its editorial, borrowing a headline from a poem by WB Yeats and asking\"Was it for this?\"There were many who shared the paper's lament\"the shame of it all\". \n\n\"Having obtained our political independence from Britain to be masters of our own affairs,\"the lament continued,\"we have surrendered our sovereignty to the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund\". The Irish finance minister at the time told the BBC that it felt like\"hell was at the gates\".\n\nThat was just over three years ago, but the shamed Celtic Tiger knuckled down. The government cut nearly 30bn euros in spending and raised taxes. Salaries were squeezed by 20% and benefits even for unemployment and disability were reduced. \n\nThe country, with its low corporate tax rate, became the hi-tech gateway into Europe for companies like Google, Paypal and Facebook. Gradually Ireland returned to growth. It is expected to hit 1.8% next year. Unemployment, although still at 12.5%, is falling.  \n\nSocial problems \n\nVictory, however, has been bought at some cost. \n\nIt is claimed that the poorest have borne the brunt of the cuts. The think-tank Social Justice Ireland claims the poorest 10% have lost a fifth of all their income; that is harsher than for other groups in society. \n\nHomelessness has increased by 20% since 2010. In a major survey, Growing up in Ireland found that 60% of families were experiencing difficulties in making ends meet - double the number from four years before. And 13% are behind with paying utility bills. A very significant number of homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages. \n\nAnd then there is emigration. The writer Fintan O'Toole once said that\"mass emigration had always been the index of Ireland's failure\". It is back. Last year more than 75,000 left the country. And 200,000 have gone since 2008.  Some moved to the UK, but many headed west to Canada and the US as previous generations had done. \n\nEmigration helped disguise the unemployment. Some have even suggested that the government actually encouraged emigration.\n\nGoing forward there will have to be another round of cuts and it will take decades to pay back the loans. But investors have rediscovered their faith in Ireland. \n\nIt may be that Portugal and eventually Greece will follow Ireland in throwing off the bailout\"straitjacket\". But for Europe two questions follow: will hundreds of thousands of young people across Europe have to look outside the continent for work? And have the years of austerity weakened Social Europe which, previously, had been one of its defining features?\nTL;DR: This weekend marks an important milestone for the eurozone. The Republic of Ireland, the second European country to need bailing out, will leave the programme - exiting financial rehab.\n\nArticle: By Andrei ZakharovBBC Russian\n\nAlexei Bilyuchenko was a key player in Wex, which stopped trading in 2018, leaving customers unable to access investments totalling nearly half a billion US dollars.     \n\nBBC Russian has spent months investigating the murky world of Russian cryptocurrency trading, trying to find out what happened to the money. \n\nIt's a story worthy of the BBC TV drama McMafia, involving an unlikely cast of characters from computer geeks and FBI agents, to a billionaire oligarch with ties to the war in Ukraine. \n\nHow two friends cornered a market\n\nThe story begins in the Russian city of Novosibirsk in August 2017 where Alexei Bilyuchenko, a former IT manager for a furniture shop chain, was lying low having narrowly escaped arrest on holiday in Greece.  \n\nSix years earlier he and business partner Alexander Vinnik, an electronic cash transfer specialist, had met online and made a life-changing decision to get involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nDescribed by friends as shy men who preferred computers to people, Alexander Vinnik and Alexei Bilyuchenko set up an exchange called BTC-e which was to become notorious. \n\nLike similar exchanges around the world, BTC-e offered investors the chance to use real money to buy virtual currencies. \n\nUnlike other exchanges in Europe and the US, BTC-e did not ask customers for their ID, meaning that as well as appealing to legitimate investors, it also offered a potential way for organised criminals to launder money.\n\nCustomers flocked to invest in BTC-e and, according to Global Witness, by 2016 it had become the third largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world.\n\nThe two partners communicated online and they only met in person in 2014 when their daily bitcoin trading reached $2m. By the time it hit $10m in 2016 they held a family party in Moscow.\n\nIn July 2017 they went on holiday to Greece, unaware US federal agents investigating international money laundering were on their trail.\n\nThe FBI suspected BTC-e was involved in hiding funds stolen from the hack of another bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox. Cybercrime experts also thought it was being used by the mysterious Russian hacking group Fancy Bears. \n\nA warrant was issued for Alexander Vinnik's arrest and Greek police detained him on the beach, in front of his wife and children.  \n\nHis mother called Alexei Bilyuchenko, who was in a different resort. In a panic, he smashed his laptop, threw it into the sea and jumped on the next flight to Moscow.\n\nBillionaire with ties to Kremlin\n\nBack home in Novosibirsk, Mr Bilyuchenko decided to try to recoup his losses by setting up another exchange called Wex (World Exchange Services).  \n\nThe FBI had seized BTC-e's website but he still had the back-up servers and, via Wex, he was able to return investments to some BTC-e clients.\n\nAt this stage, according to the version of events he later told police, and which has been shared with the BBC, Alexei Bilyuchenko decided he needed a backer to offer some protection.\n\nHe says he was introduced to Konstantin Malofeyev, a Moscow-based billionaire, with strong ties to both the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church. \n\nMr Malofeyev, who made his fortune in investment banking, is currently under US and EU sanctions for alleged links to rebel fighters in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn his police statements Alexei Bilyuchenko says he was invited to Moscow several times to meet Mr Malofeyev in his offices in a high-end shopping plaza.\n\nThe topic of how much money Wex was generating allegedly figured large in their conversations, as did the question of what might have happened to the funds held by BTC-e until the FBI swooped. \n\n\"For several months Malofeyev demanded I show him the Wex cryptocurrency balances,\"Mr Bilyuchencko told police.\n\nMr Malofeyev strongly denies any connection to either Mr Bilyuchenko or Wex. \n\nWho were the men'from the security service'?\n\nBy summer 2018, trading on Wex was slowing down, and at the end of the year it stopped altogether. \n\nThe $450m worth of cryptocurrency it was holding vanished without trace. \n\nAngry clients began demanding their money back and one filed a complaint with police in Russia's Chuvashiya region.\n\nAlexei Bilyuchenko was summoned as a witness, and he told the police an extraordinary story.\n\nHe said he had actually lost control of Wex in the spring of 2018, several months before it officially collapsed.\n\nHe said that at a meeting in Konstantin Malofeyev's Moscow office he had been introduced to some men he understood were agents from the security service, the FSB. \n\nThey took him to a building used by the FSB, not far from the Bolshoi Theatre. They asked him about Wex and then took him to the luxury Lotte hotel near the Russian foreign ministry where he says he remained under guard all night.\n\nAccording to Mr Bilyuchenko, the next morning he was taken back to Mr Malofeyev's office, where it was strongly suggested he should move the funds held by Wex into\"an FSB fund\", which he agreed to, and, according to him, on his next visit to Moscow he transferred everything as requested.\n\nBack home in Novosibirsk, it began to dawn on him, he says. He had, he claims, been the victim of a scam and, rather than transferring the money into state coffers, he had actually been tricked into handing it over to Mr Malofeyev's associates.\n\nSince telling his story to the police Mr Bilyuchenko has gone into hiding. Private security guards now protect his home and he has declined to speak to the BBC or anyone else about Wex.\n\nBomb hoaxes and the missing millions\n\nSo is Alexei Bilyuchenko telling the truth?\n\nAlexander Terentiev, who heads a campaign group for defrauded investors, told the BBC he was not convinced. But others seem less sceptical. \n\nSince the end of November, courts, public buildings, metro stations and shopping centres in Moscow and St Petersburg have been paralysed by almost daily hoax bomb threats. \n\nAccording to reports in Russian media, several of the emailed warnings have included references to Wex's missing millions and to Mr Malofeyev. \n\nA statement issued via Mr Malofeyev's Tsargrad TV channel described the bomb threats as part of\"a campaign of discreditation\"against him.\n\n\"Neither Konstantin Malofeyev nor his companies have anything to do with the theft of Bitcoins, the Wex exchange, or its management,\"it said.\n\nMr Malofeyev has declined to speak to the BBC about the case and the FSB has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. \n\nMeanwhile, in Greece, two years after his dramatic arrest on the beach, Alexei Bilyuchenko's former business partner Alexander Vinnik is still in jail. \n\nThe US, Russia and France are all seeking his extradition.

A simple story of a group of men among stark deserts and terrifying peaks, testing the limits of human existence.\n\nThe director, celebrated for contemporary classics such as The Truman Show, was hooked. \n\n\"As a feat of endurance and courage and the tenacity of human beings to survive, I thought it was superb. And it stayed with me,\"he said. \n\n\"The usual way of testing a story is,'does it stay with you enough to want to pursue it as a film?' And this was the case.\"\n\nThe story was The Long Walk, a gripping account of a Polish officer's imprisonment in the Soviet gulag in 1940, his escape and then a trek of 4,000 miles (6,437km) from Siberia to India, surviving unimaginable hardships along the way. \n\nMr Weir decided it had to be his next film.  \n\n\"But I just had one small throwaway question and I didn't expect the answer I got,\"he says.\n\n\"It is true? As it says on the cover, right?\"he asked.\n\n\"And there was a silence and the producer said:'Well, there's a controversy.'\"\n\nNo evidence\n\nThat controversy has persisted ever since the book on the subject first appeared in 1956. Right from the start, no-one could find information to prove or disprove whether the author, Slavomir Rawicz, was telling the truth, as he claimed. \n\nThere were no documents, no evidence, and all trace of his fellow escapees had vanished. \n\nFour years ago, I produced a documentary for BBC Radio 4 on the subject, hoping to track down the evidence to show that Rawicz really had done this incredible feat. \n\nThat documentary led Peter Weir to us. \n\n\"I contacted Hugh Levinson, the producer of this programme, having heard the BBC radio programme that actually raised the question of its veracity in a very sharp way and began my own investigation,\"he said. \n\n\"And out of that I came to the conclusion that I couldn't be sure that Slavomir Rawicz was himself on this long walk. He was certainly arrested and imprisoned - but did he do the walk?\"\n\nThe evidence we found suggested the answer was No. \n\nWe saw documents that suggested that Rawicz had not told the truth about his past, and that although he had been a prisoner in the gulag, he never escaped. \n\nUnknown hero\n\nA few weeks after our documentary aired, there was a baroque twist. An anonymous letter arrived, suggesting we contact a man who might be of interest. \n\nIt led us to Camborne in Cornwall, to the home of Witold Glinski. \n\nHe is an elderly Pole, courteous with a wry sense of humour - and an extraordinary story to tell. \n\nHe was interned in the gulag and, just like Rawicz, he escaped in a snowstorm. Just like Rawicz, he took the same route, surviving the heat of the Gobi Desert and the heights of the Himalayas, with one instinct forcing him on. \n\n\"I thought: I'm going to get a plane, train as a pilot, and then I get high, fly to Moscow, look for the Kremlin and blast it out of the ground,\"he said. \n\n\"That was my ambition, what was driving me. This was the driving force inside me, revenge for what the Germans and Russians did.\"\n\nGlinski said he even shared some companions with Rawicz - such as a young Polish girl who died along the walk, and an enigmatic American known only as Mr Smith.\n\nStrange encounter\n\nWas it possible that Glinski was the real hero and that Rawicz had stolen his story? Perhaps. We could find no evidence to corroborate Glinski's vivid account of his escape and trek. \n\nYet there might be a clue in what he described as a strange encounter in a street in London in the 1940s. Glinski says two men approached him, one a bedraggled Polish officer, the other a dapper Englishman. \n\n\"They said,'Are you Witold Glinski?' \n\n\"I said,'Yes, what do you want?'\"\n\nHe said they wanted to talk to Glinski about writing Polish history and that they were interested in where he came from and how he got to England.  \n\n\"I said,'I don't have anything to tell you',\"Glinski recalled.\n\nLater he realised that the Englishman was a journalist called Ronald Downing - the ghost writer of The Long Walk. \n\nHe suspects that Downing had somehow acquired a transcript of a debriefing interview in which Glinski recounted his story, and that he later conspired with Rawicz to pretend the story was his. \n\nAnd there is more evidence that even if Rawicz didn't do the walk, someone else did.\n\nWe learned of a British intelligence officer who said he had interviewed a group of haggard men in Calcutta in 1942 - a group of men who had escaped from Siberia and then walked all the way to India. \n\nAnd then from New Zealand came news of a Polish engineer who had apparently acted as an interpreter for this very same interview in Calcutta with the wretched survivors. \n\nThese stories are second-hand, and far from conclusive proof, but for Mr Weir, they convinced him that there was an essential truth in the story that he wanted to retain. \n\n\"There was enough for me to say that three men had come out of the Himalayas, and that's how I dedicate my film, to these unknown survivors. And then I proceed with essentially a fictional film.\"\n\nThis is why the film - to be released later this month - has a new title, The Way Back, and why the central character is not called Slavomir Rawicz. \n\nYet it retains its power as a tale of courage and endurance.\n\n\"It's about the struggle that all of us have to survive every day,\"Mr Weir says.  \n\n\"This is on an epic scale, but survival is at the heart of it, and what keeps you going with all the difficulties and pain of life and the bad luck.\"\n\nThe Long Walk will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 13.30 on Sunday 5 December. The Way Back opens in the UK on 26 December 2010.\nTL;DR: A few years ago, Australian director Peter Weir couldn't get something out of his mind.\n\nArticle: Reports suggest Mr Obama will ask Congress

It is nearly complete except for a section planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River.\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their supporters fear it will contaminate drinking water and run over sacred burial sites.\n\nMonths of protests, on federal land, have seen clashes between the demonstrators and law enforcement. \n\nThe final stretch required a permit from federal authorities but on Sunday, the US Army Corps of Engineers refused to grant it so it could undertake\"an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes\".\n\nThe two firms involved, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, attacked the move as a\"purely political action\".\n\nNoting that the project already has court approval, the companies accused the White House of abandoning the rule of law\"in favour of currying favour with a narrow and extreme political constituency\".\n\nThe battle continues: By James Cook, BBC North America Correspondent\n\nThe Battle of Standing Rock is far from over.\n\nA memorandum from the US Army Corps of Engineers might strongly suggest that the pipeline will be re-routed but it does not actually say that will happen.\n\nIt talks of\"consideration\"and\"discussion\"of other locations and of a\"more robust analysis of alternatives\"before permission\"is granted for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri river on Corps land\".\n\nThe Corps also acknowledges that the project has been ruled lawful by the courts.\n\nPlus it hardly needs pointing out that Barack Obama, whom the protestors praise for this decision, will soon be succeeded by Donald Trump, a supporter of the project who has previously invested in Energy Transfer Partners and may still hold stock in a related firm, Phillips 66.\n\nIt would be a very big surprise indeed were Mr Trump not to try to reverse a move by the Corps of Engineers which one Republican in North Dakota said sent a\"very chilling signal\"for the future of infrastructure in the US.\n\nBoth companies added they\"fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe\".\n\nRepublican North Dakotan politicians too have piled in, with Governor Jack Dalrymple calling the decision a\"serious mistake\"\n\nIn contrast there has been jubilation among protesters, who have numbered in their thousands, enduring bitter cold at encampments.\n\nAdan Bearcub, a Native American and military veteran, said\"this is the best news that I've heard forever - best news for Native people, native country, the whole United States - all the people.

They've got more money than me.\"\n\nThe bar and restaurant union Unite says it is concerned that some companies seem to be changing the way they distribute tips.\n\nDave Turnbull from Unite said:\"I think we still have a bit of work to do before waiters receive 100% of their tips and certainly there may need to be further legislation to address that issue.\"\n\nOther restaurants that charge staff administration fees for credit card tips include Strada, Ha Ha, Caff\u00e8 Uno and Caf\u00e9 Rouge.\n\nBay Restaurant Group, Tragus and Paramount Restaurants, which own the chains, insists none of their companies are making any profit from the fees. \n\nThey say they are following industry guidelines and the money is used to process payments or handle bank charges. \n\nSome employees have greatly benefited from the changes. \n\nAt Strada, some staff were earning \u00a32.50 an hour.

I always say you could open a mountain shop with what's up there.\"\n\nBut two years ago, as he delivered concrete to a mountain hut in need of repairs, he noticed something different at the foot of the Matterhorn glacier on the mountain's north face.\n\n\"I thought I saw something, and went for another look,\"he says.\"And on the second fly-past I realised this must be a human being, exposed as the glacier was melting back.\"\n\nIt was the body of missing British climber Jonathan Conville, who disappeared on the mountain in 1979. In the 34 years that followed, Conville's body had travelled gradually downhill inside the glacier - and it appeared at the bottom edge of the glacier, where the ice melts into water. \n\nSeptember, coming at the end of the months of summer heat, is when ice cover is at its lowest, and it was in September last year - roughly a year after Biner's discovery of Conville's body - that the remains of two more climbers were found at the foot of the Matterhorn glacier, this time by another mountaineer. \n\nAfter DNA testing they were identified last month as Masayuki Kobayashi and Michio Oikawa, both from Japan, who had gone missing in a snowstorm in 1970, nine years before Conville's death.\n\n\"More and more regularly the receding of glaciers permits the discovery of missing climbers after dozens of years,\"police said in a statement after the identities were made public.\n\nThe body of a French mountaineer, Patrice Hyvert, who had disappeared in bad weather near Mont Blanc in 1982 had been found a few weeks before the Japanese climbers, while the body of a Czech hiker, killed in an avalanche in 1974, was found in another part of the Swiss Alps a few weeks later.\n\nAll sorts of things have been retrieved from Alpine snow and ice over the years, from the remains of a crashed World War Two American bomber, to a cache of emeralds, rubies and sapphires being carried on an Air India flight which came down on Mont Blanc in 1966.\n\nBut over the last two decades the glaciers have retreated more rapidly, says Martin Grosjean, a glacier specialist at the University of Berne's Oeschger Institute. Even ice which has been permanent for thousands of years has started to melt, giving rise to a new scientific discipline - glacial archaeology.\n\nAs well as Oetzi, the mummified ancient man found near the border between Austria and Italy in 1991, 5,000-year-old items of clothing and household utensils have been found in the mountains south of Berne, shedding light on a Bronze-Age Alpine civilisation that was far more sophisticated than originally thought.\n\nHundreds of Roman shoe nails have emerged from the ice too.\n\n\"That is really interesting,\"says Grosjean.\"Each shoe nail has a kind of a bar code, showing the year it was made, where it was made, and whether these shoes were used for military troops for the Roman army, or for civilian shoes.\"\n\nAll this raises the question whether an effort should be made to find climbers who went missing and whose bodies were never found. Rather than relying on hikers to report chance findings, or leaving it to the sharp eyes of air rescue pilots as they carry out their other duties, might it not make sense to carefully examine the foot of all Alpine glaciers in September, and the areas where ice is known to have been receding?\n\nThe number of people who have gone missing on the Matterhorn is dwarfed by the number who have died on it since 1865 - about 20 compared with 500 or 600. But that is just one mountain in the Alpine range. The number is 40 if you include other peaks around the resort of Zermatt, and 270 in the surrounding Swiss canton of Valais, the majority of them climbers, skiers, or hikers.\n\nLacking a body to mourn can add to relatives' distress by making it harder to accept that a loved-one isn't coming back.\n\n\"My mother would say,'Oh, he didn't really die,'\"remembers Jonathan Conville's sister, Katrina Taee.\n\nAs time went on Katrina says she began to hope her brother would not be found.\"I felt it was a really lovely resting place for him, on a mountain. That would be bliss for him,\"she says. But her sister, Melissa, always wanted to find him.\n\nArriving in Switzerland to give DNA samples the sisters were able to hold their brother's mummified hand 34 years after his death, an experience Katrina has described as\"bittersweet but wonderful\". \n\nOne family still hoping to locate the body of a relative missing on the Matterhorn is that of Lord Francis Douglas, who was a member of the first team to conquer the peak in 1865, but among four who tragically fell to their deaths on the descent.\n\nAll the bodies were quickly found, except that of Douglas, the son of the Marquess of Queensberry.\n\nThe current Marquess of Queensberry, the renowned designer David Queensberry, says the possibility his great-great-uncle might be found has\"been in my mind all my life\".\n\n\"My family has always thought there might be a chance he might pop out some day,\"he says.\n\nQueensberry's 15-year-old grandson, Tybalt Peake, has plans to scale the Matterhorn next year with 78-year-old British climber Eric Jones, and is keen to search for Lord Douglas's body.\n\nBut Martin Grosjean argues that the chances of finding him are slim, because of the movement of the glacier at the base of the Matterhorn over the last 150 years.\n\n\"Glaciers advance and retreat naturally,\"he says.\"So at the top it's cold, snow falls. And then lower down, the ice melts. The glaciers flow naturally downhill, which means that everything that falls into a crevasse\u2026 later it appears in the glacier tongue.\"\n\nThe normal time span for anything trapped in an Alpine glacier to be washed out is, he suggests, between 20 and 50 years, though it can take up to 100 years. The recent examples of Conville, Kobayashi and Oikawa are broadly line with this - it was 34 years in one case, and 44 in the other.\n\n\"Well, we always have room for surprises,\"he says.\"But, will we find Lord Douglas? I don't think so. If he was washed out it would have been about 1900.\"\n\nAny organic matter is likely to have quickly decayed.\n\nWhen glacial archaeologists recover ancient bodies or artefacts from the mountains it's usually in areas where the ice is not moving, either because the ground is not steep enough, or the ice patch is not large and heavy enough.\n\nThere have been exceptions though. Martin Callanan of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology has written about Bronze Age arrow shafts that were recently recovered from a static part of a moving glacier.\n\n\"On the side of it was a small tongue that was not flowing, where the arrows were preserved and recovered almost complete,\"he says.\"The icy world up there is terribly complex - just as complex as the landmass under with all its ridges, gulleys and crevices. We simply never know where and when ancient frozen remains are going to appear.\"\n\nAs melting advances, the bodies of missing climbers, he suggests, could also emerge from parts of a moving glacier that have, for whatever reason, remained static.\n\nBut the idea of searching more systematically for climbers who went missing years ago gets little support from Gerold Biner or Katrina Taee.\n\nBiner points out that the skies above the Alps are now busy with helicopters, and his hunch is that most bodies emerging from the ice are spotted.\n\nAnd as Taee sees it, searching for human remains is of little importance, compared with searching for the living.\n\n\"At first of course you are desperate for them to found alive,\"she says.\n\n\"But you know anytime anyone goes up the Matterhorn it is very risky. Personally I wouldn't want anybody putting themselves at risk for my brother.\n\n\"Why risk lives for those who are long dead?\"\n\nMore from the Magazine\n\nIt's a plot line that wouldn't be out of place in a Tintin comic - a French mayor, an Alpine climber, a historian, a wealthy Jewish stone merchant from London, and their tenuous connections to a bag of lost jewels discovered on the peak of Mont Blanc.\n\nThe mystery of Mont Blanc's hidden treasure (March 2014)\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: When climbers go missing on high mountains it can be decades before their frozen remains are found in the snow and ice.

We do not believe that this was done.\"\n\nDo any statistics back up these accusations of sexism in tennis?\n\nThere are no official figures to answer one of the key questions in this debate: do umpires enforce rules for player conduct differently for men and women? \n\nBut there is data that tells us how many times women and men are fined for breaking the rules.\n\nDuring a match, umpires give an official warning for the first violation, deduct a point for the second, and for a third infringement, dock a whole game. \n\nViolations tend to be accompanied by a fine imposed by the championship referee and the Grand Slam Committee. \n\nWhat are the rules?\n\nAccording to ITF Grand Slam rules:\n\nVerbal abuse is defined as a statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator or other person that implies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise.\n\nAbuse of racquets or equipment is defined as intentionally, dangerously and violently destroying or damaging racquets.\n\nPlayers shall not receive coaching during a match (including the warm-up). Communications of any kind, audible or visible, between a player and a coach may be construed as coaching.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nDuring the 2018 Grand Slams, more fines were given out to men.\n\nWe don't have the data to test the accusation that umpires fail to punish some angry outbursts made by a man, but penalise a woman for a similar type of angry rant.\n\nDuring the four Grand Slam tournaments in 2018 - Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open - 85 fines for code violations were issued to men.\n\nThere were fewer issued to women - 43.\n\nMen play more sets at major tournaments so are on court for longer and that might lead to more infractions, or give them more time to lose their cool. \n\nTo account for the longer game time, you could work out how many fines were issued per set. So, take the US Open singles' tournament. Then include fines for in-play violations and exclude retirement and the time and game delay violations.\n\nIn the women's singles tournament that's 11 fines in 297 sets, which amounts to 0.037 fines per set.\n\nIt's very slightly lower for men - 16 fines in 460 sets, which amounts to 0.034 fines per set.\n\nSo, once these factors have been taken into account, men and women were fined a similar number of times per set during the 2018 US Open.  \n\nHowever, these calculations don't take into account whether umpires are more likely to punish female players than men for a similar outburst during a match.\n\nWhat other players said\n\nAfter the heated final, current and former players weighed in on the debate. \n\nMarion Bartoli, the 2013 Wimbledon champion, questioned the umpire's interpretation of the rules.\"When there is absolutely no curse or verbal abuse from Serena then giving her a game penalty is insane. You can't do that. It is impossible.\"\n\n\"She's right [Serena Williams] when she says the men say 10 times worse and don't even get a warning.\"\n\nBut former British number one Annabel Croft didn't think Carlos Ramos was sexist, rather that he's a strict official\"who takes nothing from any opponent whether they're male or female\".\n\nCorrection 12 September 2018: This story originally said men had been fined 21 times in 460 sets during the 2018 US Open - but this figure incorrectly included the five fines issued to men playing in doubles matches at the tournament and the story has now been amended with the correct figure.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: The fallout from  the women's US Open final between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka  has sparked debate about whether female tennis players are treated unfairly by match officials.\n\nArticle: She was accompanied by Prince Philip as she cut the ribbon on the \u00a31.35bn road bridge - exactly 53 years after she opened the Forth Road Bridge.\n\nThe Queen said the structure, the UK's tallest bridge, was a\"breathtaking sight\"and one of three\"magnificent structures\"across the Forth.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said people would\"marvel\"at the bridge in 100 years.\n\nThe Queen met children and officials at the south end of the bridge and was given a floral posy by Elizabeth Martin, grand-daughter of crossing project director Michael Martin.\n\nAfter cutting the ribbon to cheers from the watching crowd, the Queen then travelled by car across the bridge.\n\nShe then made a speech and unveiled a plaque to declare the crossing formally open.\n\nThere was also a fly-past by the Red Arrows and a flotilla of boats travelled under the bridge as the national anthem was played.\n\nThe bridge was blessed by the Church of Scotland's Moderator, The Right Rev Dr Derek Browning.\n\nThe Queen said the bridge, which sits beside the Forth Road Bridge and the Forth Rail Bridge, would be an\"important link\"between the Lothians and Fife.\n\n\"The three magnificent structures we see here span three centuries, are all feats of modern engineering and a tribute to the vision and remarkable skill of those who designed and built them,\"she added.\n\nIn her speech, Ms Sturgeon told the workers who built the bridge that in 100 years people would\"gaze at the towers and marvel and what you have created\".\n\nMs Sturgeon said the creation of the bridge was an\"outstanding achievement\"as she thanked those involved in the project.\n\nShe told them:\"The nation's heart is bursting with pride at what you have achieved.\"\n\nThe bridge opened to traffic last Wednesday.

She is learning Welsh, but feels she does not know enough to help her two young sons, Riley, eight, and Harley five, with their school work.\n\n\"I can only help them in English and I'm worried they'll fall behind with their Welsh language skills, compared to the kids who get Welsh at home every day,\"she said.\n\nShe said the boys had been watching a lot of Cyw children's programmes on S4C and playing games on Duolingo and other apps. But she wishes they could do more.\n\nCeri Anwen James, assistant headteacher at Ysgol Gyfun Bro Edern, in Penylan, Cardiff, said:\"We know that the vast majority of our parents don't speak Welsh. \n\n\"When they made the decision, many moons ago, to educate their child through the medium of Welsh, they hardly thought that one day their child would be educated in Welsh from their kitchen or lounge, due to a pandemic lockdown, with them having to navigate the intricacies of a Welsh-medium curriculum.\"\n\nShe said the school had tried to keep tasks as straightforward as possible and given pupils plenty of links and activities to stay in touch with the Welsh language. \n\n\"It's essential that they have as much contact as possible with the Welsh language while they are away from school,\"he said. \n\nTo help parents like Debbie, a number of Welsh-speaking parents and others have come forward to help by developing new content to ensure children can have fun at home, as well as do their school work in Welsh.\n\nUkulele lessons\n\nCardiff-based musician Mei Gwynedd has started ukulele lessons on his YouTube channel every Tuesday and Thursday morning. \n\n\"I think music should be available for everyone,\"he said, adding that he's trying to secure funding to provide subtitles to help non-Welsh speaking families follow along as well.\n\nIllustration\n\nCartoonist Huw Aaron provides daily videos to help kids get creative every weekday on YouTube.

Now operated by travel company Expedia, it has sister sites covering air fares, cruises, family breaks and independent holidays.\n\nFor some hotels, it has offered a new tourist grapevine to enhance their reputation.\n\nHowever, growing discontent among others culminated in this month's announcement that a law firm representing 700 of them is planning legal action against the site, on grounds of defamation.\n\nDespite this, Rochelle Turner from consumer group Which? says review sites have transformed people's holiday preparations over the past decade.\n\n\"They are an incredibly powerful tool. Consumers can empower themselves and drive markets,\"she says.\n\n\"In the travel sector, you're buying something many months in advance, you can't try before you buy and you might have very little experience of something.\"\n\nBad reviews, she says, provide an impetus for change among hotels which in the past may have gone on offering poor service.\n\nHowever, hotel owner Louis Naudi says some users take things too far. He has heard of people publishing reviews complaining about cold tea, rather than simply asking for a fresh pot.\n\nMr Naudi says he has already successfully forced TripAdvisor to take down two malicious reviews of his Royal Sportsman Hotel in Porthmadog, Snowdonia, and is involved in the current legal action.\n\n\"I'm not knocking TripAdvisor per se, I'm knocking what's happening with regards to malicious reviews,\"he says.\n\n\"They are cowards hiding behind their anonymity. You have to work out if they actually stayed and, if so, when. Then they won't respond when you write to them.\"\n\n'Meaningless' criticism\n\nEven the world's leading hotels are not immune. Six of the 197 people to have reviewed London's Dorchester rate it as\"terrible\".\n\n\"We [hotel owners] are not infallible and things occasionally go wrong and we deal with it but we don't get a chance to rectify it [online],\"says Mr Naudi.\n\nHe describes reviews in which people simply brand things\"horrible\"as meaningless.\n\nPointing to a recent refurbishment of his 1862 coaching hotel, using period fixtures, he says:\"Some people think it's wonderful. Others think it's a bit dated but you can't account for people's tastes.\"\n\nMr Naudi says 17 traditional press reviews in recent years have been positive. But travel journalism is renowned for its links to the industry. Do good reviews in the papers not simply prove that journalists enjoy free stays?\n\nTravel writer Adam Coulter admits that if hotels know a reviewer is coming, they are sure to offer excellent service.\n\nBut he says many journalists turn up unheralded and that, in any case, their experience and depth of knowledge are vital.\n\n\"The problem with travel is it's a very emotive subject. If you book a honeymoon and it's disastrous, you're going to write about it,\"he says.\n\n\"As a journalist, you have experienced other places and you're going with a completely objective view.\"\n\n'Ranting'\n\nMr Coulter, who edits Cruise International magazine, says people are quick to complain on review sites but seldom offer praise, making it hard to\"sift through the ranting\".\n\nNot so, argues TripAdvisor. Its PR team says the majority of reviews are positive, averaging four out of five, and that people would not come back if they did not paint an accurate picture.\n\nMs Turner, head of research for the Which? Holiday magazine, says bad reviews actually help legitimise the site, unlike early efforts by travel companies which removed unfavourable reviews.\n\nShe admits differentiating honest reviews from those by people bearing a grudge - or competitors trying to spoil a rival's ratings - can be difficult.\n\nPeople should not expect to find the absolute truth although genuine reviews, she suggests, might offer some praise alongside any criticism.\n\n\"You need to be able to see yourself in a review - pick out the ones you think are trustworthy.\n\n\"But holidays are subjective and your expectation of a four-star hotel may be completely different from mine. It depends on taste.\"\n\nTripAdvisor's site rules bar fake reviews and it uses electronic tools to screen each post, weeding out suspicious ones for investigation.\n\nSite users can flag up dubious posts, while hotel owners are also free to respond.\n\nDespite this, industry analyst Angelo Rossini, from Euromonitor International, says false reviews remain a problem.\n\nA more robust system is employed by accommodation booking sites such as hotels.com and booking.com. Users are sent an e-mail after their stay, asking for feedback. This at least ensures all reviewers are genuine visitors, says Mr Rossini.\n\nHe acknowledges the problems some hoteliers face, including travellers threatening to leave negative comments if they are not offered a discount.\n\nHowever, he says net effect has been positive.\n\n\"Informal tips are really valuable to this industry. Travellers seem to believe their peers.\n\n\"Hotels are much more careful now to always provide good service because... they know what the effect of a negative review can be.\"\nTL;DR: Travel website TripAdvisor is facing legal action from up to 700 hotel and guesthouse owners who complain they are victims of unfair reviews.

Why do humans have two types of circadian rhythm, the internal clock that tells us when to be awake and when to sleep?\n\nResearch suggests that the two rhythms, which are regulated by different genes, may be linked to the evolution of humans and our ancestors.\n\nThe internal body clock, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, tells us when to feel tired, hungry and alert.\n\nBut there is another rhythm that is regulated by a different part of the brain, the hypothalamus, and it appears to be linked to our ancestors' lifestyle of hunting and gathering.\n\nIn a study, published in the journal Current Biology, scientists have found that this second rhythm is controlled by a specific gene, known as the Per3 gene.\n\nThey discovered that when people have a variant of the Per3 gene, which is associated with the second rhythm, they tend to wake up later in the morning and go to bed later at night.\n\nBut the scientists also found that the variant of the gene is more common in people who live in northern latitudes, where the days are shorter during the winter.\n\nThe scientists believe that this is because the Per3 gene is linked to the lifestyle of our ancestors, who would have had to adapt to the changing light and darkness of the seasons.\n\nIn ancient times, people would have been active during the daylight hours and rested during the night. The Per3 gene may have helped our ancestors to wake up at the right time to hunt and gather food.\n\nThe scientists believe that the Per3 gene is still active in modern humans, but it has been overridden by the SCN, which is the main regulator of our circadian rhythm.\n\nHowever, the scientists also found that the Per3 gene is still influential in people who have a variant of the gene.\n\nIn a study of 1,000 people, they found that those with the variant of the gene tended to wake up later and go to bed later, even though they were living in a modern urban environment.\n\nThe scientists believe that this is because the Per3 gene is still linked to the lifestyle of our ancestors, and it is still influencing our behaviour.\n\nThe study provides new insights into the evolution of humans and our ancestors, and it highlights the importance of", "cleaned_prediction": "The Isle of Man's chief minister, Allan Bell, is to step down in October, ahead of the island's general election in September.", "gt": "The Isle of Man's chief minister and longest serving member of the House of Keys is to retire from Manx politics, it has been announced."}, {"input_prompt": "Your objective is to generate a concise and coherent summary of a given news article.

If we can do that, it will be a key driver of productivity growth and will help to close the UK's productivity gap with other countries.\"\n\nThe report said that the UK's average hours worked per week has fallen from 37.2 in 2000 to 32.9 in 2019, a decline of 11.6%.\n\nThe OECD average has remained relatively steady over the same period, at 33.5 hours.\n\nThe Centre for Policy Studies said that this trend is not unique to the UK, and that other countries are also experiencing a decline in working hours.\n\nHowever, the report found that the UK's decline has been more pronounced than in other countries, and that the country has one of the lowest average hours worked per week in the OECD.\n\nThe report said that there are several factors that may be contributing to the decline in working hours, including changes in working patterns, an ageing population, and the rise of the gig economy.\n\nIt also suggested that there may be a cultural shift towards more flexible working practices, with many employees choosing to work shorter hours or part-time.\n\nThe Centre for Policy Studies said that policymakers should focus on increasing the number of hours worked, rather than just trying to increase productivity through other means.\n\nStephen Booth said:\"If we can increase the number of hours worked, that will have a big impact on productivity growth. We need to look at how we can make working hours more attractive, and how we can increase the number of hours that people are working.\"\n\nThe report found that the UK's productivity gap with other countries is not just due to a lack of productivity growth, but also due to a decline in working hours.\n\nIt said that the UK's average productivity growth rate over the past two decades has been lower than the OECD average, at 0", "cleaned_prediction": "Tunisia says it is now 100% safe for tourists after a security upgrade following a deadly 2015 attack that killed 38 people.", "gt": "Two years after the deadly shootings at Sousse in Tunisia, the walls and the economy of the resort town are still marked by the tragedy while the hotel where the attack took place prepares to re-open."}, {"input_prompt": "Your objective is to generate a concise and coherent summary of a given news article.

Plato will be a game-changer, allowing many Earth-like planets to be detected and confirmed and their atmospheres examined for signs of life.\n\n\"Plato planets will allow us to develop and test theories of planet evolution, understanding the type of small planets in the Universe and the real frequency of Earth-like planets,\"he told BBC News.\n\nPlato is not really one telescope but rather a suite of 34 telescopes mounted on a single satellite.\n\nThe intention is for this array to sweep about half the sky, to investigate some of its brightest and nearest stars.\n\nThe observatory will monitor these stars for the tell-tale tiny dips in light that occur when planets move across their faces.\n\nAn important part of this investigation will be to perform an intricate study of the host stars themselves, using their pulsations to probe their structure and properties.\n\nSuch observations, referred to as asteroseismology, would provide key, complementary information for the proper characterisation of the rocky worlds.\n\nThe mission will be led by Dr Heike Rauer at DLR, the German space agency.  \n\nThe key British hardware contribution will be the camera system that sits behind the telescope suite.\n\nThis will incorporate 136 charge-coupled devices (CCDs) produced by the e2v company in Chelmsford, Essex.  Just under a metre square and having 2.5 billion pixels, the CCD system will be the biggest ever flown in space.\n\nIt seems certain also that the British arm of Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium) will endeavour to lead the construction of the satellite.\n\nPlato should prove to be a good fit with other next-generation astronomical facilities.\n\nThese will include the ground-based European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), which will have a primary mirror some 39m in diameter. To be built in Chile, this giant should be operating by 2024, and will have the power to investigate the atmospheres of the Plato's newly discovered planets.\n\nPlato is the third medium-class launch opportunity to be offered under Esa's so-called Cosmic Vision programme, which defines the organisation's space science priorities.\n\nThe first two to be selected were Solar Orbiter, a space telescope to study the Sun, to launch in 2017; and Euclid, a telescope to investigate\"dark energy\", to fly in 2020.\n\nEsa will now refine the final design of Plato and select the industrial prime contractor.\n\nIn addition, the agency's national member states must also agree any contributions they wish to make over and above their mandatory commitments.\n\nOnce all this is done, the mission will be formally\"adopted\"- legal-speak for\"final go-ahead\". This should happen within the next two years.\n\nThe unanimous selection of Plato by the SPC on Wednesday will be immensely pleasing to the team behind the Eddington space telescope - an Esa mission to find distant planets and do asteroseismology that was cancelled due to budget woes in the early 2000s. \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: A telescope to find rocky worlds around other stars has been selected for launch by the European Space Agency's (Esa) Science Policy Committee. \n\n\n\nArticle: It has also often been at the centre of Middle Eastern conflicts, despite its small size, because of its borders with Syria and Israel and its uniquely complex communal make-up.\n\nShia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druze are the main population groups in a country that has been a refuge for the region's minorities for centuries.\n\nFACTS\n\n\n                  The Lebanese Republic                \n\n\n                      Capital: Beirut                    \n\nPopulation 6 million  \n\nArea 10,452 sq km (4,036 sq miles) \n\nMajor language Arabic \n\nMajor religions Islam, Christianity \n\nLife expectancy 78 years (men), 81 years (women) \n\nLEADERS\n\nPresident: Michel Aoun\n\nMichel Aoun was elected by parliament in October 2016, ending a political stalemate which had left the country without a head of state since May 2014. \n\nHe is the founder of the mainly Maronite Christian political party, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM).

catching cyber crime gangs.\n\nRob Wainwright briefed a Lords EU sub-committee on plans for a European cyber crime centre.\n\nHe said the extent of the problem was often underestimated in the EU.\n\nAnd criminal gangs were becoming more sophisticated in their use of technology, which was spreading into the world of\"offline\"crime such as drug and people trafficking and VAT fraud, which netted criminals in the EU 100bn euros (\u00a385bn) last year alone.\n\nScams\n\nEuropol officials say criminals are increasingly communicating with each other through online phone services in the mistaken belief that they are untraceable.\n\nThey are also carrying out more\"traditional\"cyber crimes such as botnets, malicious software that can secretly steal credit card details, and phishing scams, in which people are tricked into handing over confidential details. \n\nMr Wainwright, a former senior official with the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, said Europol was stepping up its fight against internet-based crime ahead of the opening of a planned cyber crime centre, funded by the European Commission.\n\nEuropol, an EU-wide police intelligence agency based in The Hague, already had a\"dedicated intelligence project designed to identify the most significant cyber criminals operating in Europe\", Mr Wainwright told the committee.\n\nHe said the next stage was to launch an\"internet crime reporting online system\".\n\nThis initiative, originally conceived by the French Presidency of the EU in 2008, would, for the first time,\"collect all internet crime reported online at a national level, in a harmonised way across the EU,\"he told the committee.\n\n'Empower citizens'\n\nIt would have the ability to alert police in the 27 member states to\"connections between different investigations\".\n\n\"For the first time the EU will have a comprehensive overview of reported cyber crime from within its own borders and this could even include, in the future, a component of direct engagement with the public,\"said the Europol chief.\n\nEuropol strategic analyst Victoria Baines later explained to BBC News that the organisation was interested in eventually using a form of\"crowd sourcing\"to gather examples of suspected cyber crime so it could build up a fuller picture of illegal activity.\n\nThis would involve concerned net users scouring the net for possible examples of crime and reporting it, possibly through a dedicated website.\n\nIt could operate along similar lines to America's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a joint venture between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Centre, which for the past 10 years has allowed victims of cyber crime to make a complaint online.\n\nBut the Europol system could potentially go further because it would not be restricted to people who had themselves been the victim of cyber crime or who wanted to make a formal complaint to a law enforcement agency.\n\n'Empower citizens'\n\nMs Baines said the idea was to raise awareness of crimes such as the\"online solicitation of children\", payment card transaction fraud or\"social engineering\", in which people are tricked into giving their passwords or other personal details. \n\nAnd then\"to empower citizens not only to look out for themselves but to report criminal activity\".\n\nBut Mr Wainwright stressed in his evidence that Europol's first priority was to involve private industry and academia in the fight against cyber crime.\n\nThe crowd sourcing plan is in its embryonic stages, and will depend on the setting up of the European cyber crime centre, which is planned by 2014, if funding can be secured.\n\nBut Mr Wainwright told BBC News he was keen to\"scope out\"crowd sourcing and saw it as a potentially vital part of the the war on cyber crime.\n\nThe Lords EU Home Affairs sub-committee is investigating the EU's internal security strategy.\nTL;DR: Millions of internet users across the EU could be encouraged to join the fight against cyber crime if a ground breaking experiment in \"crowd sourcing\" goes ahead.\n\nArticle: There will be  three flights daily from Belfast City  to London City Airport. \n\nThe

He said that the commission had not received an official complaint from Apple or any other company about the matter.\n\nCounter-attacks\n\nSamsung has also been on the receiving end of patent and design-rights litigation.\n\nSome analysts view its lawsuits as a response to Apple's legal attack.\n\nThe iPad-maker succeeded in having two of its competitors' tablets banned from sale in Germany last year forcing a redesign.\n\nThe ruling against the Galaxy Tab 10.1 was upheld by the D\u00fcsseldorf Higher Regional Court today.\n\nExperts say the commission's intervention is likely to further complicate matters.\n\n\"It is really difficult for Samsung to have the commission wading in when none of its competitors have made a complaint,\"said Vicki Salmon, a member of the UK's Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys.\n\n\"At a time when there is a lot of litigation between companies it doesn't help to be on the receiving end of an official inquiry.\"\nTL;DR: Samsung's patent deals are being looked into by the European Commission.\n\nArticle: Tommy White, 27, and Jessica Smart, 28, who both live in Clapham, south-west London, have been holidaying in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands with Jessica's parents and her sisters.\n\nThe group had been on a yacht but were moved to a hotel on the south of Tortola on 5 September after the island was placed on hurricane watch. \n\nIt was there they waited for the storm to arrive, playing cards as the winds began to pick up and their windows started to\"shudder\".\n\n\"There was an incredibly loud whistling sound of the wind and our ears were popping because of the pressure changes,\"Jessica said. \n\n\"We heard a huge gust come ripping through the valley and a tree landed on our roof with a terrifying bang. \n\n\"Then silence.\"\n\nFor a moment the wind slowed and they were able to look at the damage the storm had caused - jetties no longer visible, catamarans flipped over, roofs torn off buildings.\n\nA hotel neighbour even told them, optimistically, that the storm would soon be over.\n\nBut within minutes the gusts returned at\"terrifying speed\". \n\nWith insulation from the ceiling falling around them, someone from the group yelled at them to run to the bathroom for cover. \n\n\"Three of us lay in the bath with a mattress on top that someone had dragged from the bedroom on their way in, one lay next to the bath covered by a mattress and duvet and two cowered under the marble bathroom sinks,\"Jessica said. \n\nWithin seconds of bunkering down in the hotel bathroom, the roof of the bedroom was ripped off. \n\nJessica said there was\"continued banging and crashing\"as everything in the bedroom was thrown around.\n\n\"Furniture was being smashed, the ceiling fan was flying around and the rain was pouring through the wardrobes and flowing under the bathroom door.\"\n\nThose hiding under the sinks were now sitting in six inches of water that was rising. \n\n\"The building was shuddering, as massive air conditioning units toppled off the roof and tree trunks slammed into the outside stairwells. \n\n\"We held on for dear life and weathered the worst out.\"\n\nWhen Jessica opened the bathroom door, a scene of devastation was revealed - the bedroom was flooded, the ceiling had fallen in, and only the walls and rafters were left standing.\n\n\"It was terrifying leaving the room, as there was debris still flying and devastation everywhere.\"\n\nThe group managed to leave their hotel room but remain on the island in a one-bedroom hotel room with limited drinking water and food and most of their possessions destroyed or lost.\n\nBut among all of the devastation they made a\"miracle\"discovery. \n\n\"Perhaps a true miracle is the baby kitten we have been nursing, who was less than a week old when we found her in the rubble.

But, then again, the argument goes, so was Woolworths once.\n\nAfter all, the Labour Party in Scotland was once an impregnable electoral colossus.\n\nSmashed, crushed and shrivelled, it isn't any more.\n\n\"This is UKIP's time,\"Paul Nuttall said in his victory speech.\n\nLabour, he claimed, had\"ceased to speak the language of working people.\"\n\nCue a flurry of tweets from jittery Labour MPs pointing out Mr Nuttall had once advocated privatising the NHS.\n\nUKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, buys into the Nuttall plan.\n\nThe former Conservative said\"we have maxed out the market for Thatcherite ultras,\"a reference to UKIP's original tilt towards disaffected Tories.\n\nMatthew Goodwin, Professor of Politics at the University of Kent and the party's chief academic watcher, told the BBC there was\"potential for UKIP, if they can hang together\".\n\nThat could be a big if.\n\nBut there were, he said,\"lots of radical right parties like UKIP\"in Europe who were able to command 15-25% of the national vote even without an EU referendum.\n\nIn those Labour areas UKIP is targeting, Prof Goodwin said,\"lots of voters are economically left wing, they want more redistribution, but culturally they are actually quite conservative. They like the things UKIP has been saying on immigration and on anti EU and anti Westminster platforms.\"\n\nSo, game on?\n\nNigel Farage has promised he won't be a\"back seat driver\". But history would hint he may just rattle around rather noisily in the boot.\n\nPaul Nuttall has promised his only theme will be unity. But history would hint political volcanoes that have erupted before have the capacity to do so again.\n\nUKIP has pledged to\"replace the Labour Party.\"But history would hint that won't be easy.\n\nThen again, 2016 has taught me it's not wise for political correspondents to be in the wild prediction business.\n\nAnd a party that started life in a dusty office in the London School of Economics just 25 years ago has already proved its ability to change the political weather.\n\nNow they are going to try to do it again.\nTL;DR: It is a bit like having to replace Sir Alex Ferguson or Sir Terry Wogan.\n\nArticle: The five contenders need the support of 5% of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by 14 February to make the final ballot. \n\nThe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it would be backing Lisa Nandy.\n\nAnd SERA, an environmental campaign group affiliated to the party, has said it is supporting Sir Keir Starmer, who already has the backing of Unison.\n\nOther unions, such as Unite and the GMB, have yet to make up their minds.\n\nJeremy Corbyn's successor as Labour leader will be announced on 4 April. He is stepping down after Labour's defeat in December's general election, its fourth election defeat in a row. \n\nIn the first phase of the contest, Sir Keir won the backing of most MPs and MEPs, well ahead of Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ms Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry. Clive Lewis pulled out after failing to secure enough support.\n\n'Crucial moment'\n\nThe NUM said it was backing Wigan MP Ms Nandy because\"she represents a coalfield community and has stood with us in our fights for justice and regeneration\". \n\nThe union, whose membership has shrunk considerably since its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, said it was\"confident she is the leader who can take Labour back into government once again\".\n\nIn an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil, Ms Nandy said Labour members would have to make the\"brave choice\"and not\"play it safe\"when it came to electing their next leader. \n\nShe said she had fought many battles before entering Parliament and since, making her a good candidate to be next prime minister.\n\nShe said she would abolish tuition fees, renationalise Royal Mail and renew Trident - Britain's nuclear deterrent -\"if it was coupled with a strong commitment to multi-lateral disarmament\".\n\nMs Nandy also said she did not support another Scottish independence referendum, saying:\"I think this country has had enough of referendums.\"\n\nElsewhere, in a speech on Wednesday, Ms Nandy criticised Mr Corbyn for his response to Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning of British citizens in Salisbury in 2018, saying he was\"completely wrong\"to have called for dialogue after the events.\n\n\"At a crucial moment, we hesitated in condemning an authoritarian regime... that used chemical weapons on the streets of the UK,\"she said.\n\nShe also said the UK should refuse to sign a trade deal with the US unless it signs back up to the Paris climate deal, which President Trump withdrew from in 2017. \n\nThe Socialist Environment and Resources Association (SERA) said it was backing Sir Keir because he had\"consistently supported\"its positions. \n\nThese included\"opposing the expansion of Heathrow airport, standing up to protect environmental legislation in the Brexit debate, and campaigning with us on air quality,\"it added. \n\nSir Keir said he was\"delighted\"to receiving the backing and added:\"If elected Labour leader, I will make tackling climate change our number one priority and hard-wired into everything we do.\"\n\nIn an article for the Guardian, he said Labour could win again if the party made the case for\"moral socialism that is relevant to people's everyday lives\". \n\nHe added that this should include a\"new economic model\"to replace free-market economics, and\"radical devolution of power to our nations, regions, towns and cities\". \n\nWhen the final leadership ballot opens on 21 February, members of the Labour Party, the 12 affiliated trades unions (if they opt in), and 20 socialist societies such as the Fabians, Labour Housing Group and Jewish Labour Movement, all get one vote each.\n\nThose who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - can also take part if they pay \u00a325 by the 16 January deadline.\n\nWhere will union votes go?\n\nNot all five candidates are likely to get union backing. \n\nSir Keir got an early boost when the UK's biggest union, Unison, declared their support. He is likely to get the second required trade union - possibly Community, or the shopworkers union Usdaw, or indeed both.\n\nWhile Lisa Nandy has won the backing of the now rather emaciated NUM, there is a further barrier to be overcome. \n\nThe unions and affiliates which nominate must represent 5% of the affiliated membership. In practice, this means she needs also to get a much, much bigger union on side. \n\nThe GMB is such a union. It nominated the challenger to Jeremy Corbyn, Owen Smith, in 2016 and is unlikely to back Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is seen as too close to the current leadership. \n\nBut it's not clear if they'll opt for Nandy or Starmer and its executive will hear from all of the candidates before making a choice next week.\n\nBut Nandy's supporters are hopeful the GMB, with many public service workers amongst the membership, will choose a woman who represents a northern English seat.\n\nThe executive of the vast Unite union will make its decision on 24 January.

Yet the audience were willing to forgive them any fumble or stumble.\n\nFamiliar sketches were saluted like old friends. Ancient punchlines prompted ecstatic roars of approval.

She only started moving when the officer shone a side light from the police cruiser at her car. \n\nThe officer then pulled Ms Ambrose over and issued the ticket, reported the National Post.\n\nMs Ambrose did not dispute that she had consulted her watch, but said she only looked distracted because the device must be tapped twice to tell the time. \n\nShe also argued that because the watch was worn on her wrist it was subject to an exemption in the Ontario law which covers devices that are\"securely mounted\".\n\nThe presiding Judge rejected this argument, and Ms Ambrose's testimony about how long it took her to check the time.\n\n\"Checking one's timepiece is normally done in a moment, even if it had to be touched to be activated,\"said the Judge, adding that it was clear Ms Ambrose was distracted.\n\nThe Canadian student is not the first to get a ticket for breaking the country's laws governing driver distraction by consulting a smartwatch. In 2015, a Quebec man was fined C$120 and given four points on his licence for using his Apple Watch while driving.\n\nIn 2014, the UK's Department for Transport warned about the dangers of being distracted by a smartwatch while driving.\n\nIt said there would be\"severe penalties\"for anyone who caused an accident because they were looking at their smartwatch.\n\nIt said existing laws designed to deter people from checking gadgets while driving also applied to smartwatches.\nTL;DR: A Canadian student has been fined Canadian $400 (\u00a3230, $310) for looking at her Apple smartwatch while waiting at traffic lights.\n\nArticle: European legal experts said the UK may still be liable after Brexit because of\"concrete\"obligations entered into.\n\nProfessor Takis Tridimas, from Kings College London, said commitments the UK had made under the EU's budgetary system would have to be\"honoured\".\n\nThe EU's current Multi-Annual Financial Framework, which sets a seven-year ceiling on spending, runs until 2020. \n\nThis has raised the question of what will happen if the UK leaves in 2019.\n\nThe UK is expected to begin official Brexit negotiations this Spring, with the talks scheduled to last two years.\n\nEnding Britain's annual financial contributions to the EU was one of the key arguments during the referendum campaign, with Brexit supporters arguing money could be better spent on the NHS and other UK priorities.\n\nThe UK government has not ruled out voluntarily contributing to remain part of certain EU programmes, such as the student project Erasmus or Horizon, after Brexit. \n\nBut the more controversial issue of whether the UK may have to contribute to the EU's budget for a short period after it leaves has yet to be addressed.\n\n'Unforeseeable'\n\nProf Tridimas chair of European law at Kings College London, told the Lords EU Financial Affairs sub-committee that the UK had signed up to commitments under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MAFF), which was unanimously agreed by member states in 2013, until 2020.\n\nWhile there was no precedent for a member state leaving, he said he believed these commitments were legally binding under existing EU treaties and the terms of the UK's entry into the then European Economic Community in 1972.\n\nHowever, he said they could potentially be amended in\"unforeseeable circumstances\", if all member states agreed.\n\n\"MAFF can be revised and I think Brexit is grounds for revision,\"he told peers.\"But to my mind unanimity will be required to affect it.\"\n\nPressed by committee chair Baroness Falkner whether it could be resolved as part of the Brexit negotiations, he said there was a\"good possibility\"of a deal.\n\n\"It would be wise to have one,\"he said.\"It would be in the interests of both parties and will save a lot of trouble if it were to be achieved.\"\n\n'Golf club analogy'\n\nRhodri Thompson, a barrister from Matrix Chambers, said that the UK may face a\"significant liability\"that could end up being decided by the courts.\n\nHe told the peers there was likely to be an\"interesting\"political discussion in 2018-9 about whether the question of outstanding payments fell within the jurisdiction of the British courts or the European Court of Justice. \n\n\"It will raise some rather familiar issues, namely who sets the terms of the deal, who is responsible for interpreting the deal and how much it will cost?\"he said.\n\nHe raised what he said was the\"golf club analogy\"where a member who cancelled their subscription after a week was told\"tough luck\"by the authorities and asked to pay their dues for the remainder of the period.\n\nFormer cabinet secretary Lord Butler noted that the EU's annual budgets were agreed separately under the auspices of the MAFF and that, under the EU's rules, if no agreement was reached in any one year, the budget defaulted to one based on the previous year's agreement.\n\n\"If the UK was to withdraw in 2019 as subscriptions stopped, the EU could presumably set a budget without changing the MAFF,\"he asked.\"Suppose there was no agreement on the 2020 budget and one defaulted to... 2019, is there any way the UK could be made liable for its contribution to the 2020 budget?\"\n\nProf Tridimas said it was\"not unreasonable\"to take the view this might be the case.\nTL;DR: The UK may have to contribute to the EU's budget after leaving unless a deal is done, peers have been told.\n\nArticle: Details of about \u00a380bn of spending on items over \u00a325,000 have been published online as part of what ministers call their\"transparency agenda\". \n\nThe government said some revelations would be uncomfortable but taxpayers had a right to ask about expenditure. \n\nBut critics warn that the numbers are almost meaningless without context.\n\nThe government says publishing thousands of data entries  -  some 195,000 lines of data - allows developers, organisations and companies to\"reuse and reinterpret\"it.\n\nPeople are being encouraged to pick through the enormous quantity of online information to spot waste and hold ministers to account.\n\nCheque for Charles\n\nAll spending of more than \u00a325,000 made between May and September was published - in line with a pre-election commitment by the Conservatives - although some departments also published spending over \u00a3500.\n\nAnalysis of the data by the BBC shows Capita was the biggest private sector recipient of taxpayers' money - with \u00a33.2bn out of \u00a33.3bn going on teachers' pensions.\n\nPrince Charles also got a cheque from the Ministry of Justice for \u00a3667,000 - rent for Dartmoor prison, which is on his land. He was also paid \u00a3677,000 by the Army for access to Dartmoor.\n\nAmong other private companies that receive large amounts of public money are the property company Trillium and technology giant Hewlett Packard, which have each received about \u00a3285m since the election. \n\nAccountants KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers were each paid \u00a322.5m for government contracts between May and September.\n\nThe government's car service also received payments totalling almost \u00a31.5m from departments, including \u00a3123,000 from the Department of Energy and Climate Change for\"ministerial support\".  \n\nAmong the smaller sums detailed was a payment of \u00a31,000 from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to a company that sells jewel encrusted dog collars and pet fashion accessories to help it expand into the US.\n\n'Armchair auditors'\n\nIn a video broadcast on the No 10 website, David Cameron said the publication of the information was a significant step forward.\n\n\"Just think about what this could mean,\"he said.\"People will be able to look at millions of items of government spending, flagging up waste when they see it, and that scrutiny will act as a powerful straightjacket on spending, saving us a lot of money.\"\n\nBut BBC home editor Mark Easton said some data given to journalists before the public launch had later been removed from public view.\n\nPre-released figures seen by the BBC showed the Ministry of Justice paid eight people a total of \u00a32.2m compensation for miscarriages of justice - among them two businessmen caught up in the Arms to Iraq scandal in the 1990s.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said the information had been removed for data protection reasons.\n\nCabinet Office minister Francis Maude said:\"The data isn't as good as it should be and not as good as it will be going forward. Certainly, a lot of the systems in place don't disclose, with anything like the precision that people are entitled to expect, what the money is being spent on.\"   \n\nIt is the latest in a series of online publications of data. Last month the government published the salaries of thousands of civil servants, naming individuals earning more than \u00a382,900 for the first time. And in June it published the Coins database of public spending data.\n\nMark Easton said it was part of the government's plan to abolish professional Whitehall scrutineers like the Audit Commission and replace them with an\"army of armchair auditors\". \n\n'New chapter'\n\nThe Audit Commission, the local government spending watchdog which is set to being abolished by the end of 2012, welcomed the release of the information but warned that bare figures did not provide the whole story.\n\n\"It will allow ordinary citizens to ask legitimate questions about spending, questions which will become an irritant to government departments, but I think a legitimate irritant, as citizens seek to find out what money was spent on,\"its chairman Michael O'Higgins said.\n\n\"And that's where I think the critical issue is - that what is being released is not in fact information, it is data. And data needs context to become information, and it is provision of that context that will be important.\"\n\nInformation Commissioner Christopher Graham said the development could mark\"an exciting new chapter\"in Freedom of Information.\n\n\"The government's transparency agenda presents a great opportunity to take information rights to the next level,\"he said.\nTL;DR: A \u00a326,000 bill for training Cabinet Office staff to have \"difficult conversations\" is among revelations of Whitehall spending since the election.\n\nArticle: Women about to give birth between 22:00 and 08:00 will have to call ahead to see if an on-call midwife is available, or face travelling to Bristol.\n\nThe hospital's A&E service has been closed overnight since July 2017 due to staff shortages.\n\nDirector of nursing Sarah Dodds denied the move spelt the death knell for maternity services.\n\nMs Dodds said the hospital was trying to recruit 10 more midwives to deal with a vacancy rate of 35%. \n\nThere are currently three midwives available on-call overnight.\n\n\"We want to continue to provide the level of service that we've always provided, whereby if a mother does want to deliver here then they can have that opportunity, or equally have a homebirth,\"she said.\n\nThere were 245 babies delivered at Weston in 2014/15. This figure had fallen to 143 in 2017/18. \n\nMs Dodds said this was down to more women needing care at larger hospitals in Bristol.\n\nIn January, plans were unveiled to merge University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (UHBT) with Weston Area Health NHS Trust (WAHT), which runs Weston General.\n\nThe merger could take place in spring 2019 and Weston's MP John Penrose said it was a\"big step\"towards solving the closure.\nTL;DR: Maternity services at Weston General Hospital have closed overnight temporarily due to too few midwives.\n\nArticle: Sasha Sobhani, a 33-year-old musician, appeared in court in Madrid after Iran accused him of running illegal gambling websites and money-laundering.\n\nHe denied the charges and warned he was at risk of torture if he was sent back.\n\nHe said Iran's government was angry about criticism of it he had shared with his 2.6m followers on Instagram.\n\nMr Sobhani spent much of his childhood living outside the country because of his father's career, which involved postings to Armenia, Gabon and Venezuela. \n\nHe told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo that he had stayed in Venezuela after his father finished as ambassador there in 2006 and returned to Tehran to serve as deputy foreign minister in the government of then hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nMr Sobhani eventually moved back to Iran, where he gained a following on social media as one the\"Rich Kids of Tehran\", an Instagram account that chronicled the lives of the capital's wealthy young elite. \n\nHe also ran afoul of the authorities by organising raves. He said he was arrested and sentenced to prison, but that he later managed to flee to Turkey.\n\nHe moved to Spain two years ago, when he began sharing photographs showing himself with scantily clad women, alcohol, fast cars and private jets.\n\nHe also posted videos for his Persian-speaking followers that were critical of the Iranian government.\n\n\"I criticise the regime, the lack of freedom they have, I teach them how I live and tell them that they too could live like this. And of course, Iran cannot allow the son of a high official to say those things,\"he told El Mundo. \n\nLast week, Spanish authorities acted on an Iranian extradition request, which accused Mr Sobhani of running gambling websites that are based outside Iran but are illegal under Iranian law.\n\nMr Sobhani denied he was involved at a court hearing, stressing that he only had contracts to advertise such sites. He also vowed to fight extradition.\n\n\"There they would torture me until I begged them to kill me,\"he said.\"I prefer a grave in Spain than a prison in Iran, but I trust Spanish justice.\"\n\nIn December, Iranian police said they had arrested more than 30 people\"active in the field of gambling\"as part of a crackdown. They reportedly included some Instagram influencers with more than a million followers each.\n\nIran's central bank also warned that the identities of 70,000\"active gamblers\"had been handed over to the judiciary. It warned that people who ignored warnings to stop gambling faced prosecution.\nTL;DR: Iran has asked Spain to extradite the son of a retired senior Iranian diplomat who is famous for showing off his lavish lifestyle on social media.\n\nArticle: By Laurence PeterBBC News\n\nSo what went wrong with President Vladimir Putin's pet project? \n\nRussia's Federal Investigative Committee (SK) says it is handling 12 more criminal cases linked to theft in this mega-project, which Mr Putin sees as a strategic priority for Russia, because of its huge commercial potential.\n\nThe longest jail term handed down so far was 11-and-a-half years for Yuri Khrizman, former head of state construction firm Dalspetsstroy.\n\nProf Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC the Vostochny scandal highlighted the scale of corruption in Mr Putin's huge state bureaucracy.\n\n\"How can you deal with it without declaring war on your own elite? He's not prepared to do that. This dependency on mega-projects almost invariably creates massive opportunities for embezzlement,\"Mr Galeotti said.\n\nWhy is Vostochny so important for Russia?\n\nVostochny was Russia's first purpose-built civilian site for commercial space launches. The first launch took place in April 2016 and there have been four more since.\n\nThe vast new site is in Russia's far east, well away from big cities, which reduces the risk of rocket debris hitting any large urban centre. The site used to be a Soviet missile base called Svobodny.\n\nSpace missions are a matter of national pride for Russia: it was the Soviet Union, after all, which sent the first human into space - Yuri Gagarin - in 1961.\n\nVisiting Vostochny in September, Mr Putin told space officials:\"This is the country's most important construction project of national significance.\"\n\nVostochny's total cost is currently put at 300bn roubles (\u00a33.6bn; $4.7bn), Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reports. But the project has been dogged by cost overruns and delays.\n\nDeveloping Vostochny is also a highly political move, as Russia has until now relied on the Soviet-era Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for international space launches. Kazakhstan is a close neighbour, but having the main launch facility on Russian territory is safer for Moscow in the long term.\n\nThe space centre is still being built: a second launchpad under construction will host the Angara, a new heavy-payload rocket, with the inaugural launch set for 2021.\n\nVostochny also lies in an under-developed region with high levels of poverty, so the centre could help the local economy.\n\nHow did things turn sour at Vostochny?\n\nIn early 2015 a group of building workers at the site went on hunger strike, saying they were owed wages after a subcontractor's bankruptcy. \n\nWhen the planned first rocket launch was delayed in 2015 - it took place the following year - Mr Putin ordered the SK to examine how Vostochny was being managed. Far-reaching corruption was discovered.\n\nOn Sunday the SK reported that 58 officials involved in the project had been sentenced for fraud and abuse of office. \n\nKhrizman's theft alone cost the state 5.2bn roubles in losses. He and several other construction managers were jailed in February 2018.\n\nHis son Mikhail was jailed for five-and-a-half years. \n\nThe former chief accountant of Dalspetsstroy, Vladimir Ashikhmin, got seven years. The former president of the Khabarovsk regional assembly, Viktor Chudov, got six years.\n\nBudget funds were embezzled by artificially inflating labour and material costs and through fake deals with subcontractors, Russian business daily Kommersant reported. \n\nSub-standard concrete was also used for the launchpad, which then had to be repaired, Tass news agency said.\n\nRead more on Russia's space programme:\n\nDespite the scandal, Vostochny is still being overseen by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the state space agency Roscosmos.\n\nMr Rogozin is close to Mr Putin, but not in the president's inner circle of top aides, Prof Galeotti told the BBC.\n\n'Stealing hundreds of millions'\n\nAt a government meeting on 11 November Mr Putin spoke angrily about the continuing corruption at Vostochny. \n\n\"A hundred times people were told:'Work transparently.' But no! They're stealing hundreds of millions,\"Mr Putin said.\n\nHis spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that the outburst was directed at the previous - not current - managers of the project. He said 11bn roubles had been stolen, of which 3.5bn had been later recovered.\n\nLack of financial transparency is the basic problem with this and other big state projects in Russia, Prof Galeotti said. \n\n\"President Putin would love Vostochny to be demonstrably a world-beater, he's looking for success stories now, but even this isn't enough to tackle the problems in the system. He's unwilling to really modernise the fundamentals of the system.\"\n\nHe said the problems were reminiscent of Soviet-era white elephant projects, notorious for wasted resources.\n\nOther countries, including the US and China, remain keen to do business with Roscosmos, valuing its space expertise and technical prowess.\n\nBut new players in space, like Elon Musk's SpaceX, are already challenging Russia's competitive advantage.\nTL;DR: Russia's new Vostochny space centre has lost at least 11bn roubles (\u00a3133m; $172m) through theft and top officials have been jailed.\n\nArticle: Richard BlackFormer environment correspondent\n\nThe most basic one is simple - money.\n\nOne end of the hose will be attached to a balloon floating a kilometre up in the air. \n\nThe other will be tethered to the ground, with a pump pushing water up the pipe so it will spray out at the top.\n\nThis and other investigations that the UK team is performing will cost in the region of \u00a31.6m ($2.5m).\n\nAnd much larger sums will become necessary if and when bigger experiments are needed - because the eventual aim of this would be to get into the stratosphere, tens of kilometres above our heads.\n\nAnd what comes out would probably not be water but tiny particles of sulphate dust, mimicking the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions.\n\nFor sure, technical research is needed to explore the potential of different forms of geo-engineering - as it is with CCS.\n\nBut the technology is, for both geo-engineering and CCS, probably the easiest piece of the puzzle.\n\nAs I discussed on Monday (and thanks as always for your comments on it), the big issue with CCS is that it costs more to generate electricity - and as things stand now, why would anyone bother?\n\n(The kicker is that the CO2 can be used to bring up more oil from wells that are approaching the end of their conventional commercial life, which does pay for the carbon capture but will in the end lead to more CO2 entering the atmosphere - but that's another story.)\n\nWe're also in a grey area regarding regulation.\n\nUnder whose water\n\nIf you're an island nation and you want to store carbon dioxide in the rocks under your feet, in all probability that's going to be OK.\n\nBut what about if the storage sites lie in geological formations that extend under a neighbouring state, as could well be the case in much of Europe, for example?\n\nAnd putting it under the seabed has already raised questions under the London convention on dumping at sea.\n\nThese obstacles are even clearer with geo-engineering.\n\nHow would schemes like this be funded in practice?\n\nWho would regulate them?\n\nWhat would be the mechanism that arbitrates between conflicting interests when something goes wrong - if injecting particles into the stratosphere over Russia, for example, were to neuter the South Asian monsoon?\n\nGiven that some large-scale experiments could bring adverse impacts, how are they to be overseen - even if it's agreed that they should happen?\n\nThere have been a couple of international agreements (at the UN biodiversity convention last year, for example, when governments agreed there should be no geo-engineering schemes that damage nature).\n\nBut the big questions remain unanswered - even, largely, un-discussed.\n\nGo back to the 1960s, and the biggest threat in the minds of many governments was nuclear war.\n\nFor sure, technologies were developed to fight it and to survive it.\n\nBut in parallel, governments and societies asked and answered some of the social questions.\n\nThe answers may not have been convincing and may not have been pretty, because nuclear war is possibly the ugliest prospect that has ever confronted humankind.\n\nBut at least discussions were had - and some of them, between governments in private, eventually led to disarmament.\n\nNow, there are voices, some of them at the top of politics, who will tell you that climate change is the biggest threat facing the human race.\n\nIf it is, the social and political discussions that need to happen and reach conclusions around the topic of geo-engineering ought to be happening now - in parallel with the technical research, if not ahead of it.\n\nCritical Path Analysis tells you that you should begin the longest part of a composite task first, in order to reach the conclusion as soon as possible.\n\nThe hurdles that CCS and especially geo-engineering present, along with the finance question, are almost certainly more challenging than the technical ones presented by carrying one end of a hosepipe up on a balloon and spraying some water out.\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\nTL;DR: I'm not too keen on raising the same kind of point in successive articles, but the news that  UK scientists are to trial an innovative piece of geo-engineering kit within a couple of months  begs some of the same questions that came up in Monday's piece on carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nArticle: The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionists (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have said they are supporting judicial review proceedings.\n\nFormer MEP Ben Habib and former Labour MP Kate Hoey are also backing it.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said they were committed to challenging the NI Protocol\"in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels\".\n\nShe added that the judicial review proceedings will challenge the NI Protocol's\"compatibility with the Act of Union 1800, the Northern Ireland Act of 1998 and the Belfast Agreement\".\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods.\n\nThat has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nUnionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union.\n\nThe DUP said Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster will be named parties in the proceedings along with deputy leader Nigel Dodds, Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Sammy Wilson, the party's Westminster chief whip.\n\nMrs Foster said Mr Habib, Mrs Hoey and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister were so far\"committed to these proceedings but we expect others to also join this path\".\n\nShe said the protocol\"drove a coach and horses\"through both the Act of Union and the Belfast Agreement, also known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\"We are following our five-point plan of opposition to the protocol and will challenge its imposition in the courts, in Parliament, in Stormont and in Brussels,\"she added.\n\n\"The views of unionists will not be side-lined nor our concerns silenced.\"\n\n'Fair and legitimate thing to do'\n\nUUP leader Steve Aiken said that\"testing the NI Protocol in the courts is a fair and legitimate thing to do\".\n\nHe added that the actions that brought the protocol into force\"fundamentally undermine the principle of consent and laid out in the Belfast Agreement\".\n\n\"The absurdities of the protocol affect everyone in Northern Ireland; every legitimate action needs to be taken to deal with this very unequal, disproportionate and divisive treaty,\"he added. \n\nTUV leader Jim Allister said he welcomed the planned judicial review challenge and that he hoped\"all strands of unionism will join in this necessary effort\".\n\nHe said that\"without Ben Habib and Baroness Hoey we would not be at this point\".\n\nHowever, he said that it was\"not a substitute or alternative to sustained and effective political action against the protocol\". \n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), who campaigned against Brexit and have said parties must work together to make the protocol work, described the legal action as\"ill-judged\".\n\n\"There will be few with sympathy for the argument that the protocol, which prevents a hard border in Ireland and guarantees dual market access for local businesses, breaches the Good Friday Agreement,\"said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.\n\n\"That notion is stretched even further when the argument is made by a party that opposed the agreement in the first place.\n\n\"I'm sure the courts will decide what we all, including the DUP, already know.

Now, with the various parts of the UK back under the strictest of restrictions, it is time to revisit those practical questions.\n\nA lot has changed since the start of the pandemic, but most things are still far from straightforward.\n\nCan I register a birth?\n\nIn normal times, it is a legal requirement to register the birth of a child, in person, within 42 days.\n\nThat deadline has been relaxed since the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nIn the first national lockdown, it was impossible to register a birth. Now there may be some online booking options but, again, many parents may find they have to wait. In Scotland, you are still permitted to go out to register a birth.\n\nParents cannot usually\u00a0apply for child benefit\u00a0or universal credit until a birth is registered, but that rule has also been relaxed.\n\nSadly, but inevitably, registering a death is still possible, and can usually be done on the telephone.\n\nIs writing a valid will still possible?\n\nThe pandemic has led to an amendment of a law in England and Wales that has been in place since 1837.\n\nThis law was strict. For a will to be valid, it needed to be signed in front of two witnesses, and have two people sign it in your presence.\n\nNow, witnessing a signature can be done by video link, but it must be in real time. The Law Society says that the conventional method (at a social distance) remains better and safer - but until the end of January 2022, video-witnessed signing is permitted.\n\nHow do I pay in a cheque?\n\nAmong the premises that can stay open - as with the first lockdown - are banks and the Post Office.\n\nOpening hours may be shorter, and those shielding should not be making such a trip.\n\nMany banks allow people to pay in cheques by submitting a photograph of it via their mobile app. Others accept cheques sent, with a paying-in slip or account number, through the post.\n\nBank customers can also pay in cheques, check their balance, and withdraw cash at the Post Office.\n\nHow do I top up the electricity meter?\n\nFour million people have prepayment energy meters and, pre-pandemic, some would normally have gone to a shop to top-up their credit. Many of these shops remain open.\n\nHowever, in mid-December new rules from the regulator Ofgem required suppliers to offer emergency credit to customers who cannot top up prepayment meters.\n\nIf customers are in debt, suppliers must put them on\"realistic and sustainable\"repayment plans.\n\nThis formalised a voluntary agreement in place over the summer.\n\nMy sink is blocked, can I call a plumber?\n\nYour individual circumstances will determine how much of a risk it will be to call in professional help. Clearly, if you can unblock it yourself, or even leave it if possible, then that would be better.\n\nGuidance means tradespeople should follow social distancing rules, wear appropriate face coverings, should not work if they show any symptoms, and should not accept refreshments such as a cup of tea.\n\nIn Scotland, tradespeople are permitted to visit homes, but only for essential services.\n\nSurveyors can visit and house viewings are possible - because this time people can still move home during lockdown.\n\nWill the bailiffs still come calling?\n\nThe threat of bailiffs coming to the door to enforce an eviction of tenants has been an unnecessary risk, according to some charities.\n\nThe rules can vary in the devolved nations of the UK, but there have been temporary bans in place for bailiff action of this kind in areas with the highest level of restrictions.\n\nSome of those temporary bans are set to end in the coming days.\n\nBailiffs chasing unpaid bills such as parking fines or council tax generally use other ways to chase payments and there are industry guidelines on how they should behave - including a requirement not to shout.\n\nCan I still collect my pension from the Post Office?\n\nPeople who like to collect their pension in cash may be shielding and unable to do so.\n\nHowever, they will usually have a Post Office card account, so they will still be paid the money.\n\nThousands of people have a nominated trusted friend or family member who can withdraw cash from this account on their behalf. That option is now possible to set up via the phone - a change from the start of the first lockdown.\n\nDo I still have to pay my regular bills?\n\nBills cannot be ignored, even in these financially difficult times, otherwise there is a serious risk of spiralling debt.\n\nLast year, with the agreement of lenders, some 2.5 million people deferred mortgage payments, two million deferred credit card or loan repayments, and many thousands delayed the payment of rent.\n\nSupport, such as reduced repayments, is still available for those struggling to pay but with strings attached. Unlike much of last year, continuing to take a so-called payment holiday can affect your credit rating which may make borrowing harder in the future.\n\nI've lost my job, how do I sign on?\n\nThose claiming universal credit - the main collective benefit for unemployment and housing support - do not need to visit a jobcentre.\n\nApplications can be made online or over the phone.\n\nThere are a wide range of benefits available, and they can be different depending on where you live in the UK.\n\nIt is particularly important to to do your research, or seek independent and free advice, before starting an application, partly because any existing benefits you receive may be affected.\n\nMy MOT is due, what should I do?\n\nDuring the first national lockdown, the government granted car, motorcycle and van owners\u00a0a six-month exemption from MOT testing.\n\nThis time, you are permitted to go out in order to take your vehicle for its test.\n\nHow do I pay my doorstep lender or rent-to-own?\n\nBorrowers have the option to take a one-month payment holiday with payday loans any time before the end of March, assuming they have not taken one already.\n\nAnyone who has already done so and is still struggling to repay must contact their lender to organise a repayment plan. Simply failing to pay can bring heavy charges.\n\nFor rent-to-own products, the rules are the same - except a payment holiday can be extended to six months.\n\nMy hair is getting really long, can I get it cut?\n\nFor now, hairdressers are shut, just as they were during the Spring months of last year.\n\nSome people may have taken the chance to get their hair cut fairly recently. Others may be returning to the style of last spring - or getting the scissors and clippers out again.\nTL;DR: When the first national coronavirus lockdown was announced last Spring, some of life's most basic household tasks suddenly got a lot harder.\n\nArticle: Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the aircraft had violated Iranian airspace, and that the incident sent a\"clear message to America\".\n\nBut the US military insisted the drone had been over international waters at the time, and condemned what it called an\"unprovoked attack\"by the IRGC.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted:\"Iran made a very big mistake!\"\n\nThe incident comes at a time of escalating tension between the two countries.\n\nOn Monday, the US defence department said it was deploying 1,000 extra troops to the region in response to\"hostile behaviour\"by Iranian forces. It has already sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers.\n\nThe US has also accused Iran of attacking two oil tankers with mines last Thursday just outside the Strait of Hormuz, in the Gulf of Oman. Iran rejects the allegation.\n\nIt was the second time in a month tankers had been attacked close in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day.\n\nTensions were further fuelled on Monday when Iran announced its stockpile of low-enriched uranium would next week exceed limits it agreed with world powers under a landmark nuclear deal in 2015.\n\nIran stepped up its production in response to tightening economic sanctions from the US, which unilaterally withdrew from the deal last year. \n\nWhat happened on Thursday?\n\nThe IRGC said its air force had shot down a US\"spy\"drone in the early hours after the unmanned aircraft violated Iranian airspace near Kuhmobarak in the southern province of Hormozgan.\n\nIn a speech carried live on Iranian state television, IRGC commander-in-chief Maj-Gen Hossein Salami warned the US to respect Iran's territorial integrity.\n\n\"Those who defend the borders of the Islamic nation of Iran will react in a total and decisive way to any intrusions by foreign elements on our land. Our borders are our red line.\"\n\nHe added:\"Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran.\"\n\nThe US military's Central Command confirmed a US Navy Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS-D) aircraft was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile system while operating in what it said was international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz at 23:35 GMT on Wednesday (04:05 Iran time on Thursday).\n\n\"Iranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false,\"spokesman Navy Capt Bill Urban said.\"This was an unprovoked attack on a US surveillance asset in international airspace.\"\n\nReuters news agency later cited a US source as saying US naval assets had been dispatched to the drone debris field in international waters.\n\nThe BAMS-D is a RQ-4A Global Hawk High-Altitude, Long, Endurance (HALE) drone that can carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions over vast ocean and coastal regions, according to the US military.\n\nFirst direct incident of crisis\n\nThis is the first direct incident of the current crisis involving the US and Iranian militaries and is a powerful reminder of the dangers of escalation in the Gulf. \n\nAs far as the Iranians are concerned, the downing of the drone was intended to send a clear and explicit message to the Americans -\"our borders are our red line\"- a point underscored by the IRGC's commander-in-chief. \n\nSo there is no doubting who shot down the US drone, an MQ-4C Triton. It is a massive aircraft with a wing-span equivalent to a small airliner. But the two sides differ as to where it happened. The Iranians say it was in their airspace; the Americans say that it was not.\n\nAccording to some reports, US President Donald Trump himself is eager to dial down the tension, fearing a spillover into outright conflict. But this is just the kind of incident that could provoke just such a cycle of action and response.\n\nIs this the first time Iran has targeted a US drone?\n\nLast week, the US military accused Iran of attempting to shoot down a US MQ-9 Reaper armed drone with a surface-to-air missile in an attempt to disrupt surveillance of one of the tankers that was attacked, the Kokuka Courageous.\n\nThe drone had earlier observed a fire on board the other tanker, the Front Altair.\n\nThe previous week, another US MQ-9 Reaper was shot down over Yemen by a surface-to-air missile fired by the Iran-backed rebel Houthi movement. \n\nThe US military said the altitude of the engagement\"indicated an improvement over previous Houthi capability, which we assess was enabled by Iranian assistance\". Iran denies providing weapons to the Houthis.\n\nIn 2011, Iran said it had captured a US RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that had been reported lost by US forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It developed its own version of the drone, one of which was shot down by Israel last year.\n\nUS-Iran tension: Recent events\n\nMay 2018: US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. \n\n2 May 2019: Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil.\n\n5 May: The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of\"troubling and escalatory indications\"related to Iran.\n\n8 May: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons.\n\n12 May:  Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a\"state actor\". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation.\n\n13 June: Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated.\n\n17 June: Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. \n\n20 June: Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz.\nTL;DR: A US military surveillance drone has been shot down by Iranian forces while flying over the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nArticle: Daryll Rowe infected five men he had unprotected sex with and sabotaged the condoms of another five in Brighton and Northumberland.\n\nAfter sex with some of the men he texted mocking messages, including\"I have HIV LOL. Oops!\"and\"I'm riddled\".\n\nDuring the trial hairdresser Rowe, 27, claimed to believe months of drinking his own urine cured him of the virus.\n\nHe was convicted at Lewes Crown Court of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and five of attempted GBH.\n\nDuring the six-week trial the prosecution described Rowe's actions as a\"campaign\"to infect as many men as possible over a four-month period starting in October 2015 across the Brighton area. \n\nHe had relations with eight men he met on dating app Grindr, before moving to Northumberland and having unprotected sex with another two men later in 2016.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Nigel Pilkington, deputy chief crown prosecutor in the South East, said he believed there\"may well be more men out there\"who had fallen victim to Rowe, of no fixed address.\n\nThroughout the case Rowe was described as a\"control freak\"who would shift between being charming and\"jealous\".\n\nMr Pilkington said he was a\"cruel and callous man\"whose crimes were\"akin to stabbing or shooting somebody\".\n\nMr Pilkington added:\"The absolute deliberate infection of other men by a man, is not something I've ever come across in 25 years as a prosecutor and I don't expect to ever come across a case like it again.\n\n\"This is a man who, after the event, having known what was he was doing, sent mocking and abusive texts to some of his victims. It must have been traumatic.\"\n\n'Like rape'\n\nDeborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said Rowe's behaviour was\"utterly exceptional and vanishingly rare\".\n\nShe added that the majority of HIV transmissions are by people who are unaware they have the virus.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, one of Rowe's victims, whose biological parents both had HIV and later died, said the news of his condition drove him to a suicide attempt.\n\n\"I was always so careful,\"he said.\n\n\"My dad was a junkie and she was a very young mother. I was always trying to run away from that lifestyle, That's why I always insisted on condoms.\"\n\nHe added it was a\"reminder of my past\".\n\n\"I feel it's come full-circle, and has made this my new life, which is very unfair,\"he added.\n\n\"[Rowe] called me over and over.

Under the\"one country, two systems\"arrangement, it has some autonomy, and its people more rights. \n\nThe bill was withdrawn in September but demonstrations continue and now demand full democracy and an inquiry into police actions. \n\nClashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers and throwing petrol bombs.\n\nThe extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances.\n\nOpponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely. \n\nHow did the protests escalate?\n\nProtesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. \n\nBy then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent.\n\nIn September, the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was\"too little, too late\".\n\nOn 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule, Hong Kong experienced one of its most\"violent and chaotic days\".\n\nAn 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles. \n\nThe government then banned protesters wearing face masks, and in early November a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.\n\nOne week later, a policeman shot one protester at close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters.\n\nIn November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University became another defining moment.\n\nLater that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion.\n\nThe vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.\n\nWhat do the protesters want? \n\nSome protesters have adopted the motto:\"Five demands, not one less!\"These are: \n\nThe fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. \n\nProtests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia.\n\nIn many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies.\n\nChinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in\"bodies smashed and bones ground to powder\".\n\nWhat is Hong Kong's status? \n\nHong Kong is a former British colony handed back to China in 1997.\n\nIt has its own judiciary and a separate legal system from mainland China. Those rights include freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.\n\nBut those freedoms - the Basic Law - expire in 2047 and it is not clear what Hong Kong's status will then be.\n\nWant to know more? \n\nRead this: \n\nAnd watch this:\nTL;DR: Anti-government protests have rocked Hong Kong for months and the situation shows no sign of dying down.\n\nArticle: Neighbouring council Rhondda Cynon Taf has already introduced tough new rules, fining dog owners \u00a3100 if they fail to pick up after their pet.\n\nNow councillor Alex Williams wants Bridgend to take similar action to protect children's and adults' health.\n\nHis bid for harsher rules for dog walkers will be debated on Wednesday.\n\nMr Williams said coaches and players at Heol-y-Cyw and Pencoed rugby clubs had complained about the health implications of dog fouling on their sports pitches. \n\nHeol-y-Cyw club secretary John Powson said one player had to have an operation after getting an infection following a match, thought to be caused by dog mess left on the grounds. \n\nMr Powson, said:\"It started off as a little stud mark on his leg, and then it just got worse and worse.\"\n\n\"We can't prove what caused it, but there was dog muck on the pitch before they started playing and it had to be cleared up, so it seems something of a coincidence,\"he added.\n\nMr Powson, who is a dog owner himself, said the club had very little power to stop people from letting their dogs foul on the pitch.\n\n\"All we can say is there is a fine if they do not pick it up, it's the ones who have four or five dogs and let them run wild that are the problem, if you have it on a lead and stick to the path it is not doing any harm,\"he said.\n\nMr Williams, independent councillor for the Penprysg ward, has started a petition calling for tougher action in Bridgend and has put forward a motion calling for the council to bring in new rules.\n\nThese include:\n\nThe petition has been supported by Ynysawdre councillor Tim Thomas, who said he will be voting in favour of the motion.\n\n\"My daughter plays for a local under-8s rugby team and on numerous occasions coaching staff and grounds staff have had to remove the playing surface of dogs' mess,\"he said. \n\n\"My concern is that, despite these noble efforts, there will inevitably remain some trace of the mess leading to the possibility of people using our playing fields being open to disease and injury.\"\n\nIn October, Rhondda Cynon Taf council introduced new rules including banning dog walking in all council-run school grounds, children's play areas and marked pitches, under a new Public Spaces Protection Order.\n\nMr Williams said following this example, which saw the local authority run a poster campaign depicting a child eating dog mess left on a playing field, would show Bridgend council was\"taking this issue seriously\".\n\nResponding to his petition, one resident wrote:\"My child is registered blind and uses a long cane to aid him - we have to carry wipes because he cannot see the dog mess when using his cane.\"\n\nA spokesman for Bridgend council said less dog fouling was a\"positive move\"but the petition needed to be considered\"in closer detail\"to\"avoid penalising dog owners who already act responsibly\".\n\n\"With this in mind, we are currently developing a proposal for working in partnership with an external agency to look after and enforce issues such as dog fouling, fly-tipping, littering and more,\"he said.\n\n\"We have also recently introduced additional bins and bag-dispensing stations as part of a trial to make it easier for people to dispose of pet waste in the county borough.\"\nTL;DR: There are calls for a ban on dogs at all council playing fields in Bridgend county to clamp down on fouling after a rugby player got an infection.\n\nArticle: Peter Bunyan, 40, of Carharrack, near Redruth, Cornwall, was convicted in March and jailed for seven years.\n\nHe was accused of neglecting his duties by turning his police radio down on shifts before having sex with women.\n\nAt the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice Griffith Williams said, while Bunyan's offending was serious, his sentence had been\"manifestly excessive\".\n\nThe court was told Bunyan was a\"serial philanderer\"who, from 2007 to 2011, had affairs with women he met through his work at Devon and Cornwall Police.\n\n'Show off'\n\nBunyan was convicted at Taunton Crown Court of eight counts of misconduct in public office and sentenced to seven years.\n\nBut Mr Justice Williams said Bunyan's case was not one of a police officer or PCSO taking\"blatant advantage\"of vulnerable women.\n\nHe said Bunyan used the police database to research personal details after he had started relationships with the women\"in order to show off\". \n\nSitting with Lady Justice Rafferty and Mrs Justice Thirlwall, the appeal court judge said Bunyan had abused his position to impress the women he was having sex with when on duty.\n\nWhile that was serious, he said it was to be clearly distinguished from cases where officers had taken blatant advantage of vulnerable women in the course of their duties or had used police records to provide information to criminals.\n\n\"Having regard to all those matters, we have concluded that the sentences in this case were manifestly excessive,\"he said.\n\nThe Royal Courts of Justice judges cut Bunyan's sentence to three years, which means he is expected to be released from HMP Dartmoor on licence after serving half of that term (18 months).\n\nFollowing his conviction in March, Bunyan was dismissed without notice from the Devon and Cornwall force.\nTL;DR: A police community support officer (PCSO) jailed for misconduct has had his sentence halved.\n\nArticle: Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg later urged Russia to pull back its forces.\n\nRussia's defence ministry denied sending troops to eastern Ukraine to help pro-Russian separatists there. \n\nThe European OSCE monitoring mission has warned of\"a real risk\"of further escalation in a conflict that has killed more than 4,000 people.\n\nHeavy artillery fire rocked the east Ukrainian city of Donetsk, the industrial hub held by pro-Russian separatist rebels, on Wednesday.\n\nThere were also reports of fighting near the rebel-held city of Luhansk, with one Ukrainian soldier killed and another injured, according to Ukrainian security forces.\n\nAnalysis: Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent\n\nEvents in Ukraine seem to be turning full circle.\n\nBack in August, Nato was warning about the deployment of Russian artillery batteries inside Ukraine, the supply of Russian military equipment to the rebel forces and the build-up of further Russian combat units at the Ukrainian frontier.\n\nSince then many of these units have been withdrawn. \n\nBut now with tensions renewed, Nato's Supreme Commander in Europe General Philip Breedlove has confirmed that over the past two days, Nato has seen columns of Russian armour, artillery and crucially - combat troops - entering Ukraine.\n\nThe question now is whether this is just a re-run of events in the summer or does a more significant clash beckon, perhaps one where the Kremlin may decide - in its terms - to teach the Ukrainians a military lesson. \n\nGeneral Breedlove also confirmed that Nato believes Russia is deploying nuclear-capable weapons to Crimea - a reference to reports that Russia is deploying short-range Iskander ballistic missiles there that could potentially be equipped with nuclear warheads.\n\nUnmarked convoys\n\nThe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has reported seeing unmarked convoys in the region in recent days. \n\nThis was confirmed by US Gen Breedlove on Wednesday, who said\"Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defence systems and Russian combat troops\"had been sighted.\n\nGen Breedlove, talking to reporters on a visit to Bulgaria, said the alleged Russian troop deployment may be intended to reinforce\"pockets\"under separatist control in eastern Ukraine. \n\nThis could, he said, help them to form\"a more contiguous, more whole and capable pocket of land in order to then hold on to it long term\".\n\nHe did not specify how many troops, vehicles or weapons were seen. A Nato official confirmed to the BBC that Nato had\"assessed\"that the equipment and troops were Russian in origin.\n\nIn a separate statement, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said any significant military build-up would be\"a severe threat to the ceasefire\", which was agreed in Minsk on 5 September.\n\nHowever, Russian defence official Maj-Gen Igor Konashenkov said\"there was and is no evidence\"to support Gen Breedlove's claims. \n\nRussia has consistently denied sending troops and equipment to support the rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine.  However, the rebels have admitted being helped by\"volunteers\"from Russia. \n\nPreparations\n\nSeparately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the country's long-range aircraft would go on patrol flights over the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHe said that the current situation required Russia to restart the flights, which were cut at the end of the Cold War.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine's defence minister has said that government forces are redeploying in preparation for a possible new offensive by pro-Russian separatist rebels.\n\n\"The main task I see is to prepare for combat operations. We are doing this, we are readying our reserves,\"Stepan Poltorak told a government meeting.\n\nThe UN's assistant secretary general, Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen, later warned of the possibility\"of a return to full-scale fighting\"in Ukraine, speaking at an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 4,000 people have died since government forces moved in April to put down an armed insurrection by the rebels in the two regions, which border Russia.\n\nHundreds of people have been killed since a fragile truce was agreed three months ago.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday her government was\"not satisfied\"with the progress in implementing the Minsk agreement, but added that there were no plans at present for further economic sanctions against Russia over its involvement in Ukraine.\n\n\"Further economic sanctions are not planned at the moment, we are focusing on the winter and the humanitarian situation there and how to get a real ceasefire,\"she said.\nTL;DR: Nato has seen Russian military equipment and Russian combat troops entering Ukraine this week, its top commander Gen Philip Breedlove says.\n\nArticle: Prof George Boyne will start the role in August, succeeding Prof Sir Ian Diamond, who announced his retirement last year after taking up the position in 2010.\n\nProf Boyne is originally from Aberdeen and is currently at Cardiff University.\n\nHe said:\"It is a great honour.

But ShadeCraft wants to integrate Alexa completely, so that the parasol behaves just like an Amazon Echo smart speaker. \n\nVoice commands such as ordering Amazon products or asking what the weather will be like could then be done from the patio as well as the living room.\n\nAmazon has made it hassle-free to add Alexa to products, by offering the assistant on a single chip - the Alexa Connect Kit.\n\nIt has been available for a few months now, but at CES Google just announced their equivalent tool with a strikingly similar name - Google Assistant Connect.\n\nHowever, any product using that chip will have to wirelessly connect to a Google smart device, which will process voice data.\n\nStill, in time, Bloom customers may be able to choose to talk to Google Assistant instead of Alexa.\n\n\"I think that we are perfectly positioned to be the extension of the AI hub outdoors,\"said Mr Gharabegian.\n\nMore from CES 2019:\n\nThe benefit of this would be to give users access to the particular functionality offered by different virtual helpers. \n\nGoogle Assistant, for example, tends to be better at answering queries about the wider world than Alexa. It also has exclusive access to some of the search firm's other products, letting users control Chromecast audio streams or display YouTube and Google Maps on devices with screens.\n\nAlexa, by contrast, is more widely supported by third-party products and has more apps.\n\nAnother firm that thinks its customers may be best at deciding how to interact verbally with its devices is Sonos.\n\nIt has shown off a prototype smart speaker that allows users to select either Alexa or Google Assistant, though it isn't possible to activate them both at the same time.\n\nPart of the problem is that interacting with multiple virtual helpers through one device could get confusing.\n\n\"Say an alarm goes off on the speaker,\"writes Dieter Bohn at tech site The Verge.\"You might not know whether it was Alexa or Google that set it off, and you'd be stuck guessing which one to ask to stop while it beeps.\"\n\nHowever, in time, people may well become accustomed to using both assistants interchangeably, and even others like Apple's Siri or Samsung's Bixby, depending on what they want to do.\n\n\"[Consumers] will be entrenched in one of those ecosystems and so the manufacturer of appliances is not going to want to lose sales to consumers who prefer one of them,\"says Ross Rubin at market analysts Reticle Research.\n\nFirst-mover advantage\n\nBut for now the land grab is everything, which is why executives at Amazon must be feeling pleased with Alexa's progress.\n\nAmazon is estimated to have 41% of the global smart speaker market while Google comes in second, taking 28%. Alexa's dominance is visible across a wide range of other products too.\n\n\"Alexa had made the first-mover advantage and for a few years, that was the dominant integration technology at CES,\"explains Mr Rubin.\"Google has stepped up its presence year after year.\"\n\nSome, though, remain sceptical that voice assistants add much value to most products.\n\n\"They're putting Alexa in everything and I'm getting a little bit tired of it,\"one user-interface specialist from a major car-maker told the BBC at CES.\n\n\"If I want to open my toilet why should I tell Alexa to open my toilet instead of opening it myself?\"\n\nThe specialist, who wishes to remain anonymous, noted how the\"sheer force\"of Amazon's marketing was particularly noticeable at the tech trade show this year.\n\nOne other CES attendee concurred, tweeting:\"To say that Amazon Alexa is everywhere at CES in Las Vegas would be an understatement.\"\n\nMr Rubin thinks that there are certain gadgets where the benefit of hands-free control does make sense.\n\nTake kitchen appliances, for instance. \n\nInstead of trying to finger a recipe book or smartphone with - literally - butter fingers, you can ask a voice assistant to call out the directions or repeat something if you need to hear it again.\n\nThe hands-free use case applies to Focals - a new range of stylish smart glasses made by Toronto-based firm North. \n\nFocals project a colour display into the wearer's eyeball by bouncing it off the lens to create a hologram-like visual in the right eye. This is used to relay text messages or directions to a place, for instance.\n\n\"The result that you get is a small transparent display that sits about an arm's length in front of you,\"says spokesman Alexander Ingram.\n\nWith Alexa and a speaker on board, there's another option - just listen to the information instead. \n\nNorth received investment from Amazon and so has built Alexa into Focals - but Mr Ingram says there are no plans to keep the glasses as an Alexa-only product.\n\n\"By being able to take these assistants out of the home and into the world, that just opens up a huge range of new applications,\"he said.\n\nThere is another way to bring voice activation to a product without having to rely on one of the tech giants' assistants.\n\nSnips lets firms build their own voice tools that run solely on the devices they were intended for.\n\nSo, if you want to make a coffee machine that simply responds to a handful of crucial commands, it would be an option.\n\nWhat's more, by not relying on Amazon's or Google's servers, users would not need to bother connecting their new coffee machine to the cloud before asking it for a cappuccino. And that avoids the risk of a cyber-security scandal or other privacy issue.\n\n\"This kind of information should stay in your home, it should not go elsewhere, to a server on the opposite side of the world,\"said the firm's vice president of product, Sebastien Maury.\n\nRead and watch all our CES coverage at bbc.com/ces2019\nTL;DR: At CES, there's no shortage of gadgets to talk to.

They were accompanied by 33 bands. \n\nRestrictions were also imposed on music being played during the feeder parade past the Ardoyne shops and past Catherine Court off the Shore Road.\n\nA number of residents' associations were granted permission to hold protests at the parades.\n\nThe Royal Black Institution in Belfast had criticised the Parades Commission's rulings ahead of Saturday's event.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"The time has long past when the commission should be confined to the dustbin of history. \n\n\"They are parasites living on the misery their determinations bring to communities as they propagate cultural apartheid and exercise a Stalinist-like desire to control and dictate cultural expression.\"\n\nThe Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective, which opposes parading by loyal orders along a contentious stretch of the Crumlin Road, at Ardoyne shops, also criticised the commission.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"These contentious marches only serve to poison community relations and further alienate and polarise our peoples, and all just to pander to the will of a few bigots who use culture as an excuse to mask and impose their outdated and obsolete triumphalism upon our community.\"\n\nThe statement said the march was not welcome on the stretch of road past Ardoyne shops and an alternative route should be used.\nTL;DR: Seven police officers have been injured during a contentious loyal order parade in Belfast city centre. \n\n\n\nArticle: The plans for the city's Bargate Quarter were revised following the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe developer, Tellon Capital, altered the scheme last month to drop a 240-bedroom hotel and add more flats suitable for\"home-working\".\n\nThe number of flats has gone up from 287 to 519 and the shopping area has been scaled back to about a third.\n\nThe hotel was added to the previous plans a year ago instead of 185 units of student accommodation. \n\nTellon Capital said the changes had been made to focus on the positive aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic,\"such as the fact more people are walking and cycling\".\n\nIt said the final plans include secure cycle spaces and electric vehicle charging points, with garden areas to make a feature of the medieval walls.\n\nBuildings along Queensway and East Street and the Bargate Shopping Centre have already been demolished ahead of work starting on the redevelopment.\n\nSouthampton's town walls\n\nSource: Southampton City Council\nTL;DR: Final plans for a multimillion-pound scheme to redevelop an area in central Southampton have been submitted.\n\nArticle: Cleveland Fire Brigade said a new state-of-the-art retained fire station would be built at the existing Headland Fire Station on Durham Street.\n\nThe new station will replace the existing facility which is nearly 50 years old.\n\nChief Fire Officer Ian Hayton said it was\"important\"to continue investment in the fire brigade's future.\n\nThe new building will be designed to continue to house one fire appliance, along with a range of ancillary facilities.\n\n'Financial pressures'\n\nThe brigade also plans to develop a community garden.\n\nMr Hayton said:\"Despite the financial pressures facing the brigade, it is so important that we continue to invest for the future to ensure that we have facilities which are fit for the 21st Century.\n\n\"The Headland Fire Station is coming to the end of its working life which is why it is a high priority on our building replacement programme.\"\n\nThe fire station is one of six retained fire stations maintained by Cleveland Fire Brigade.\n\nRetained firefighters only attend the fire station when they receive an emergency callout.\n\nWork on the new building is expected to start early next year with completion by summer 2013.\nTL;DR: A new fire station is to be built in Hartlepool as part of a push to improve firefighting facilities.\n\nArticle: By Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News\n\nIn a study published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, scientists used thermal cameras to reveal that, in hotter weather, the animals moved to the lower, cooler parts of the trees.\n\nThey also pressed their bodies even closer to the trunks. \n\nThe team, led by researchers from the University of Melbourne, was studying how koalas regulated their temperature. \n\nThis is part of a wider research project investigating the effect of climate on land-dwelling animals in Australia, a country which experienced an extreme heat wave earlier this year. \n\nWhile PhD student Natalie Briscoe was studying the koalas' behaviour, she noticed that in the winter the animals would stay high in the trees - up near the leaves feeding. \n\nIn the hotter summer weather though, they would move down.\n\nDr Michael Kearney from the University of Melbourne explained:\"They'd just flop over the [lower] tree trunks. \n\n\"It looked like they were spread-eagled and uncomfortable; it seemed like the wrong thing to do.\"\n\nBut measurements of the temperatures of the tree trunks showed that, on days as hot as 39C, they were up to seven degrees cooler than the air. \n\n\"That's what made us wonder if the koalas were using the trees as a heat sink,\"said Dr Kearney. \n\nThe team used a thermal camera to take pictures of koalas on a particularly hot day. \n\n\"When we got the images, back it was so obvious what the koala was doing,\"explained Dr Kearney.\"You could see the koala sitting on the coolest part of the tree trunk with its bottom wedged right into the coolest spot.\n\n\"If we had thermal vision, it would have been an obvious thing.\"\n\nDeadly heat \n\nDr Kearney said large trees had their own protective\"microclimate\", which is likely to become increasingly important to tree-dwelling creatures like koalas if global temperatures continue to increase as predicted. \n\nAnother researcher who has used thermal cameras in his ecological research - Dr Justin Welbergen from James Cook University - says thermal images show exactly how animals can exploit these cooler microclimates in trees. \n\n\"This helps them to maximise their chances of survival during extreme heat events,\"He told BBC News.  \n\nResearch Dr Welbergen published earlier this year revealed the effects on wildlife of such extreme events. His research revealed that 45,500 flying foxes had died on just one extremely hot day in southeast Queensland.\n\n\"Our thermal video shows group of flying-foxes trying to cope with an extreme heat event by distributing saliva on their wings,\"he explained. \n\nHugging trees, Dr Kearney said, helps the koalas to avoid similar water loss - enabling them to\"dump heat\"into the tree and to avoid panting.\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\nTL;DR: Hugging trees helps koalas to keep cool, a study has revealed.\n\nArticle: The agreement between the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters and South West parks was described as a\"milestone\".\n\nThe two will still focus on attracting investment to their own geographical areas.\n\nHowever, the agreement encourages the parks to exchange knowledge and best practice.\n\nThe Scottish government has also announced it will provide \u00a34.1m to boost research at Orkney's European Marine Energy Centre.\n\nIts marine parks agreement will be formally signed at Renewable UK Wave and Tidal Conference in London and witnessed by UK climate change minister Greg Baker and Scottish energy minister Fergus Ewing.\n\nThe two ministers have welcomed the agreement.\n\nDevelopment agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise described it as a\"milestone agreement\".\n\nThe Wave Hub, an electric\"socket\"for testing wave energy machines off the north Cornwall coast, has been unused since it was installed on the seabed in 2010, but managers say the first device is expected to be connected this year.\n\nWave Hub general manager Claire Gibson said:\"This agreement sends a clear and positive message to the industry that the UK is serious about accelerating commercial development of the marine energy sector.\"\nTL;DR: Marine energy parks in the north of Scotland and south west England are to work together to develop the UK's wave and tidal industry.\n\nArticle: The Internal Market Bill would transfer powers from the EU to the UK government to spend on areas such as economic development, infrastructure and sport.\n\nThe Welsh Government accused its UK counterpart of\"stealing powers\"from devolved governments. \n\nBut UK ministers said the law would allow them to replace existing EU funding programmes.\n\nFrom next year, powers which had been held by the EU will be transferred to the governments around the UK.\n\nThe UK government says the draft law is aimed at ensuring trade within the United Kingdom can continue\"unhindered\"under these new arrangements.\n\nMuch attention has been focused on the fact that the legislation could override key elements of UK ministers' Brexit deal with Brussels, in breach of international law. \n\nIn addition, the legislation will give ministers in Whitehall powers to spend money to replace EU funding programmes on areas that would otherwise be devolved to the Welsh Government.\n\nThe new spending powers include infrastructure, economic development, culture, sport, and support for educational, training and exchange opportunities. \n\nA senior UK government cabinet minister insisted the powers would\"drive our economic recovery from Covid-19 and support businesses and communities right across the UK\".\n\nMichael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said:\"These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK Parliament and people of the UK.\"\n\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was\"vital\"that seamless trade continued between the four nations, and that\"investment must continue to flow unhindered\".\n\nBut the Welsh Government Minister for European Transition Jeremy Miles said the powers would\"sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations.\"\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the bill\"provides ammunition to those people who would favour the breakup of the United Kingdom\". \n\n\"I'm in favour of a UK Common Market and I'm in favour of a UK-wide state aid regime, but the proposals in the white paper are absolutely not the right way to go about it,\"he told Sky News.\n\nPlaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said:\"This bill is the single biggest assault on devolution since its creation.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC later on Wednesday, Mr Hart said he found it\"pretty strange\"that Labour Welsh ministers and Plaid Cymru objected to UK government plans to spend money in Wales.\n\n\"Seems to me they're more anxious about protecting their little political clique in Cardiff than they are actually doing something about economies we tried to recover from Covid and move on from Brexit,\"he said.\n\nWales has been eligible for \u00a3375m a year from EU funds with the management shared between the EU and the Welsh Government.\nTL;DR: Plans for a new law giving the UK government more powers to spend in Wales have been published.\n\nArticle: By Dan WhitworthMoney Box reporter\n\nFigures showed a 36% rise in complaints about how banks dealt with fraud and scams this year compared to 2019.\n\nDebbie Enever from the ombudsman told BBC Radio 4's Money Box\"work still needs to be done\"on a voluntary code most banks signed up to last year.\n\nUK Finance, representing banks, said stopping fraud was a primary focus.\n\nIt added that the voluntary code was\"not working as intended\"and called for legislation to better protect customers.\n\nThis Contingent Reimbursement Model Code - or CRM - means that banks should refund victims, if they are not at fault, when they have been tricked by criminals into transferring money out of their own banks accounts.\n\nBetween April to September 2020, figures from the Financial Ombudsman Service showed there were 6,603 complaints about banks from victims of fraud, up from 4,840 between April and September in 2019. \n\nFraudsters pretend to be from the police, the government or the banks themselves and use intense psychological pressure, often against elderly and vulnerable victims.\n\nLast year, \u00a3456m was stolen from more than 100,000 victims using this method, destroying victims' financial futures and devastating them and their families.\n\nBut whilst the Financial Ombudsman Service only upholds around a third of general complaints made about banks, when it comes to complaints about this type of fraud it backs consumers in three quarters of cases.\n\n\"Under the code that came in last year, the presumption was supposed to be that consumers would get their money back unless they were at fault in someway,\"Ms Enever said.\n\n\"We're just not seeing that the banks are following through on that at the moment.\n\n\"We are always keen to let people know that they can come and complain to us [about banks and building societies] and the email addresses and phone numbers are on our website.\"\n\nSix-month wait\n\nLeslie runs a small company in London and had \u00a313,200 stolen from him by criminals who hacked his email account in June 2019.\n\nHe should have been covered by this code but after investigating for five months his bank, Lloyds, told him it wouldn't refund the money.\n\nLeslie complained to the ombudsman which, in June 2020, backed his complaint but six months on Lloyds still hadn't refunded the money.\n\nMoney Box started investigating Leslie's case and within two hours of Lloyds being contacted by our reporter, Leslie was emailed to say he would be getting his money back.\n\n\"I'm obviously delighted to hear the money is returning... but this system is clearly broken and there needs to be a change,\"he said.\n\n\"When a bank promotes they have entered a code [to refund victims] they are asking customers to trust them to follow that code.\n\n\"My own experience suggests Lloyds at least are not deserving that trust.\"\n\nLloyds told us keeping its customers' money safe is its priority and it had a great deal of sympathy for Leslie. \n\nIt said it had already agreed to refund Leslie's money before Money Box got involved, adding that the timing was just a coincidence.\n\nWhat is the Financial Ombudsman Service?\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service settles disputes between consumers and businesses that provide financial services.\n\nIt is the final word in complaints and banks and building societies must abide by its decision.\n\nThe agency has a two-stage process: an\"initial view\"handed down by an investigator and a\"final decision\"which is enforceable by law.\n\nIn 2019/20 it upheld an average of 32% of complaints in general about banks.\n\nThat figure nearly doubled to 58% in relation to complaints about frauds and scams.\n\nIn cases of push payment fraud that number was even higher at 75%.\n\nKaty Worobec of UK Finance, which represents the main banks, said:\"Fraud is a crime which has a devastating emotional impact on victims and its proceeds fund serious criminal activities which damage our society.\"\n\nShe told Money Box the primary focus was stopping fraud in the first place and helping customers stay safe.\n\nIn relation to the CRM code, Ms Worobec said it was not working as intended, admitted a lack of consistency from banks and was working on making it more effective.\n\nShe said the industry was also calling for further action, including new legislation,\"to drive more consistent outcomes for consumers and firms\". \n\nYou can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme by listening again here.\n\nFollow Money Box and Dan on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Banks \"too often\"

Twitter has generally struck me as the industrialisation of confirmation bias. Facebook, a softer version of the same. And other platforms, such as Instagram, similar.\n\nBut this claim - that our digital media habits are an exercise in the lazy endorsement of our prejudices - is itself lazy and full of prejudice.\n\nAsked to do a report on the link, if there is one, between social media and polarisation, or social fragmentation, as part of the BBC's Crossing Divides season, I surveyed the academic literature. You can watch our report from the Six o'clock News bulletin with some brilliant young people who met on a Facebook group called The Cabinet. \n\nMost of the academic work in this area points to the complexity of that link, and resists a clear causal connection. Indeed, for the most part, it comes down against the idea that the online world is full of echo chambers.\n\nThe abstract for this commonly cited article in the journal Public Opinion Quarterly, by Seth Freeman, Sharad Goel and Justin M Rao, puts it succinctly: \n\n\"Social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals\", the authors write.\"However, somewhat counter-intuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum\".\n\nThey go on:\"The vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favourite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences - both positive and negative - of recent technological changes.\"\n\nLast week, I went up to Oxford to visit Dr Grant Blank. His most recent work has examined, as he puts it,\"the myth of the echo chamber.\"\n\nIn an important paper, published with Elizabeth Dubois in the journal Information, Communication and Society, Dr Blank concluded\"social media and [the] internet [are] not [a] cause of political polarisation.\"\n\nTheir findings are striking. In an interview, Dr Blank gave me a nuanced account of our digital behaviour. He told me,\"one of the characteristics of the internet is that it has created a very large, complex media environment that includes not just social media but also print media, television, radio, and online media of various types, including online copies of print media - as well as specialised online media.\n\n\"And if you look at that entire multi-media environment what you find is people are not in echo chambers, that people are not locked into groups of like-minded people all thinking the same thing and all talking the same way.\"\n\nI asked him specifically about that alleged link between social media and political polarisation. \n\n\"You can find a relationship between social media and political polarisation if you look only at social media,\"he said.\"If you look, in other words, at Twitter or you look only at Facebook. But in a complex, multi-media environment - which is the way people live now because of the internet - you don't find that, you find people consuming a lot of media.\n\n\"You find people interacting with others who have varying points of view, changing their minds, encountering contradictory information, checking information that they find in social media. It turns out, if you look at media generally and you ask people what media do you trust, and then you rank the media in terms of trust, social media is at the very bottom of trustworthiness in terms of news.\"\n\nAt this point he returned to a familiar argument:\"In Britain it turns out the top [i.e. most trusted] is television. Probably due to the BBC\u2026 but television, print media, online media of various kinds are all higher than social media in terms of trust.\"\n\nBBC Crossing Divides\n\nA season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.\n\nAcademics in this field do, however, accept that there is an element of prejudice reinforcement on some social media channels. They just add that you're more likely to encounter different worldviews than in an era where you mainly read The Daily Mirror, say, or watched mainly CNN. \n\nSocial media has an effect on the ignorance or knowledge of a citizenry that is, it turns out, nuanced and complicated. It certainly gives prominence and oxygen to fringe views that would once have struggled to get a hearing. It ostensibly democratises opinion, by equalising the format in which the US President and some conspiratorial nutter opine: both have 280 characters on Twitter.\n\nAnd for those who want to indulge niche interests, whether political or otherwise, it creates digital wormholes in which you can lose yourself.\n\nWhy should the idea of echo chambers, or the associated theory be so seductive and popular? Partly because Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble, is an engaging speaker. Also, because there are times when we all feel like our social media feeds slant in one particular direction. And, ironically, because the idea of echo chambers and filter bubbles has bounced around social media, gaining traction there. \n\nMaybe some platforms, such as Twitter - which is the preferred receptacle for verbose journalists and politicians - are more prone to uniformity of outlook for some users. Which might explain the final reason echo chambers have become part of the prevailing orthodoxy:  people like me have parroted the idea without surveying the academic literature.\n\nJournalism and academia: that's one divide that should be crossed more often.\n\n If you're interested in issues such as these, you can follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4.\nTL;DR: A common, and ostensibly common sense, assumption about the era we are living through is that social media is a primary cause of polarisation.\n\nArticle: Motorists have reacted angrily to the Guildhall car park being given priority over the roundabout near Tesco.\n\nSenior officers said the barrier-controlled car park - closed to the public during office hours - needed the \u00a322,000 repairs for safety reasons.\n\nWork on the roundabout is set to be carried out later this month.\n\nSte Harry was one local who criticised the council's priorities as a\"joke\", claiming on Twitter the roundabout was far busier than the car park and a\"danger to everyone\".\n\nNick Bell tweeted:\"I'd like to see if any of them has the guts to say yes I authorised the work.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru councillor Marc Jones has also been critical, saying people felt the independent-led administration was getting its priorities wrong when council jobs were at stake due to financial pressures.\n\nIn the council's defence, deputy leader David Bithell, who is also cabinet member for transport, said the scheduling of roadworks was decided by officers rather than politicians.\n\nHowever, he claimed the car park was in a key location, being used as the civic entrance for weddings and other events.\n\n\"You could argue that it's part of our important landscape in Wrexham to make sure that it's viable and economic for growth in the town centre,\"Mr Bithell told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nHe added:\"I'd just like to remind everybody that it's not a councillor car park - it's a public car park that councillors use.\"\n\nSenior officers said it was decided to fix the car park's\"deteriorating\"surface during the summer holidays, to minimise disruption.\n\nCouncillors previously enjoyed the use of the car park free of charge until permits priced at\u00a0\u00a3144 a year were introduced in May.\nTL;DR: Wrexham council bosses have defended a decision to resurface a car park used mostly by councillors and staff before fixing potholes on a busy roundabout.\n\nArticle: By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst\n\nThe National Audit Office says it will affect the way we work, travel, heat our homes - even how much meat we eat.\n\nIn a report it says the cost of cutting CO2 is highly uncertain, but the cost of allowing temperatures to rise would probably be greater.\n\nThe PM has vowed to cut emissions by 68% by 2030 based on 1990 levels.\n\nMaking the new pledge, Boris Johnson urged other world leaders to follow with ambitious targets at the virtual climate summit he is hosting on 12 December.\n\nThe announcement has been broadly welcomed, although scientists say it does not guarantee dangerous climate change will be avoided.\n\nThey urged Mr Johnson to impose policies to back up his ambitions - currently the UK is slipping behind its existing targets.\n\nThe PM said: \u201cWe have proven we can reduce our emissions and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process \u2013 uniting businesses, academics, NGOs and local communities in a common goal to go further and faster to tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cToday, we are taking the lead with an ambitious new target to reduce our emissions by 2030 faster than any major economy.\n\n\u201cBut this is a global effort, which is why the UK is urging world leaders to bring forward their own ambitious plans to cut emissions and set net zero targets.\u201d\n\nOne of the UK\u2019s leading climate scientists, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, told BBC News: \u201cMr Johnson\u2019s target is ambitious \u2013 but we need action to back it up, right now. \n\nHe noted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak recently committed \u00a3127bn to the HS2 rail link and new roads - which will both increase emissions - while offering just \u00a31bn to home insulation, which would reduce emissions.\n\nProf Hoskins remarked: \u201cThe actions of the chancellor don't measure up. Every single department has to wear climate change glasses when they think of new policies, and the Treasury clearly hasn\u2019t got that message.\u201d\n\nHe and other scientists said even if the UK and other nations keep their promises on cutting emissions there was no guarantee the world would avoid serious heating.\n\n\u201cThe world will be increasingly difficult and dangerous with every percentage point of temperature rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are important things we don\u2019t know for sure. How much more does it take to destabilise Antarctica, for instance? We don't know\u2026 and the impact could be devastating.\u201d\n\nProf Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia said if nations matched the UK\u2019s lead \u201cit won\u2019t be a safe climate \u2013 but it will be a safer climate than we\u2019d get based on current levels of ambition.\u201d\n\nWhich sectors have cut emissions most?\n\nIn 2019, total UK greenhouse gas emissions were 45% per cent lower than in 1990. Achieving the new target, a 68% cut, will require the UK working 50% harder than it currently is. \n\nBetween 2008 and 2018 the energy sector saw the biggest fall in emissions (-62%) as the UK abandoned coal burning. It's followed by the waste sector (-46%) which started capturing methane emissions, and industry (29%) where efficiency improved. Emissions from transport have barely fallen (-3%). Farm emissions are almost static (-2%).\n\nA coalition of green groups is urging the government to reach a 75% cut by 2030. \n\nAnd more radical groups such as Extinction Rebellion say the UK should stop emissions almost completely within a few years to be confident of avoiding climate disaster.\n\nResearch by the London School of Economics (LSE) found that it is economically feasible for UK emissions to be cut by 72%. The government has not costed the range of measures that would be needed, but experts say more homes will need to switch to low-carbon heating. Gas-guzzling SUVs might also be forced off the roads \u2013 and frequent fliers taxed more.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises government, welcomed the 68% cut, but warned: \u201cThis is more than just a number. \n\n\u201cIt should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and net zero strategy to deliver against the UK goal; clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions; and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries.\u201d \n\nNet zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.\n\nMore policies will be revealed if the long-delayed Energy White Paper is published, as expected, before Christmas.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s 68% target represents the UK\u2019s NDC \u2013 its nationally determined contribution towards meeting the Paris Agreement. \n\nNDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe Paris deal, signed in 2016, is aimed at keeping global temperature rise well under 2C, preferably with a maximum rise of 1.5C.\n\nThe virtual event Mr Johnson is hosting next week is in place of annual UN climate talks scheduled for Glasgow in November but postponed by a year because of Covid-19.\n\nThe UK will hold the presidency of next year\u2019s meeting in partnership with Italy. It is known as COP26 - the 26th Conference of the Parties. \n\n'Further and faster'\n\nLaurence Tubiana, an architect of the Paris Agreement, said:\"This commitment from the prime minister can underpin his personal efforts to seek similar moves from counterparts in the run-up to the Glasgow Summit next year. \n\n\u201c(It will need) investments in areas ranging from greener steel production to farming and clean heating technologies, but other countries can draw confidence from Britain's leadership.\"\n\nThe RSPB\u2019s Martin Harper said: \u201cThe UK government\u2019s new 2030 climate target will enhance the UK\u2019s leadership credentials.  \n\n\u201cBut we need to go further and faster, in particular by investing in protecting and restoring habitats such as our peatlands which are so important for locking up carbon.\u201d \n\nA UK strategy on conserving peat is long-delayed.\n\nEd Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said:\"We welcome the important strengthening of the 2030 UK target. But this is the minimum we should aim for.\"\n\nPeter Simpson, from Anglian Water and co-chair of the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, said: \u201cCredible plans matter in the race to zero, so today\u2019s announcement is welcomed. The spotlight is on.\u201d \n\nMeg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the net zero target was\"daunting\".\n\n\"The government hasn't put its own house in order yet or done enough to put the UK on course to meet older, easier targets.

So far we haven't heard any counter proposals. We haven't heard any alternative suggestions that will deliver the same effect in a different way.\n\n\"But we have made very clear if people have other ideas that will deliver on this very important agenda for British people we're absolutely prepared to listen to them and we're prepared to enter into a dialogue about them, but at the moment the only proposition on the table is our four year proposal.\"\n\nThe prime minister, who spoke to his Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico on Monday to discuss the UK's renegotiation, has acknowledged no agreement will be reached this week on the UK's wider agenda for reform.\n\nBut senior Conservatives are hopeful progress can be made paving the way for a possible deal in February. \n\nAsked whether Mr Cameron was prepared to compromise on the four-year limit, Downing Street said he was\"open to looking at new ways of dealing with the issue\"but the basis for discussions would be\"what's on the table\".\n\nThe Mayor of London and Conservative MP Boris Johnson said the rest of the EU had\"recklessly\"disregarded a proposal from the UK which he believed would go down well with their citizens.\n\n\"These people are radically and dangerously misreading the prime minister if they think he wants to stay in the EU at any price,\"he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.\"The David Cameron I know is much more Eurosceptic than some of his senior colleagues.\"\n\n'Bobbing about'\n\nAnd Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake told Radio 4's World at One that the EU need to wake up to public concerns about migration in the UK, warning\"the whole EU project could fall apart\"if the UK voted to leave. \n\nBut the PM is also facing a backlash from some within his own party who argue he has not been bold enough. \n\nFormer Environment Secretary Owen Paterson likened the PM's position to\"someone bobbing about in the back of a dinghy, being towed along by a Channel ferry\", arguing his negotiations were\"froth and nonsense\"compared with the much bigger question of the future shape of the eurozone.\n\nAnd the Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan told the World at One that the UK was\"banging the table and angrily demanding the status quo\", having abandoned hope of securing meaningful opt-outs from social and employment laws or European court judgements.\n\nAppearing before a committee of peers, Europe minister David Lidington said the UK had to be\"sensitive\"to the concerns of former Eastern Bloc countries about migration, saying their history under Communist rule meant the issue had a particular\"emotional resonance\".\n\nBut he suggested other EU countries were\"quite shocked\"that the UK, according to demographic trends, was set to overtake Germany as the EU's most populous country by 2050 and he believed a\"good agreement\"could be reached in this and other areas.\n\nMr Lidington said there was a\"way to go\"in the negotiations but this week's meeting would signal\"where we can see low hanging fruit\"and what other areas required more time and work, adding that he suspected\"nothing is going to be agreed until everything is agreed\". \n\nUK's EU referendum in-depth\n\nQ&A: What Britain wants from Europe\n\nGuide to the UK's planned in-out EU referendum\n\nBBC News EU referendum special report\nTL;DR: Philip Hammond has said the UK is willing to consider other proposals to reduce levels of EU migration amid reported opposition to its plan to limit access to in-work benefits.\n\nArticle: By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing\n\nAnd now they know: she has been accused of leaking state secrets - a serious charge that could result in a lengthy prison term. \n\nMs Gao's lawyer, Teng Biao, told the BBC he agrees with online speculation that Ms Gao is being punished for her perceived connection to the release of\"Document Number 9\". \n\nThe internal Communist Party strategy was published by a Hong Kong newspaper's website last August. The memo warns party members of the dangers of Western liberal democracy and the rise of civil society. \n\nGao Yu recently told foreign journalists the authorities had warned her to keep a low profile during this politically-sensitive period - the 25th anniversary of the political uprisings in Tiananmen Square. \n\nShe is one of several dozen Chinese dissidents to be detained by the authorities ahead of the 25th anniversary of 1989 bloody clash between student protesters and Chinese soldiers in Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe BBC's Beijing bureau interviewed Gao Yu in March 2013 to hear her thoughts on the challenges facing Xi Jinping as he assumed his position as China's president. \n\nShe spoke at length on the economy, Chinese politics and many of the country's social challenges. \n\n\"China's economic success has come from having land and cheap labour, and producing products of low additional value mainly for the West,\"she said.\n\n\"Xi Jinping knows that we have hit the end of this road. He knows that we have to learn from the West and make innovations. He  sees this, but whether he can change it is another matter.\n\n\"Another thing is the wealth gap mainly caused by corruption. We put our energy into creating a market economy, but the benefits we got from reform were basically taken by government officials.   \n\n\"All capital is transferred to the hands of government officials and rich people, regardless of environmental protection, social security, medical insurance, education, etc. So now the relationship between people and government officials is very tense,\"she also said.\n\n\"Because the party's leaders have profited so much from the market economy, the whole world sees how corrupt our government officials are and how angry our people are.

By 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, this had risen to 2.3. \n\nThere were 1.2 divorces per 1,000 married women over 60 in 1991, rising to 1.6 in 2011. \n\nIn contract, overall divorce rates for all married men fell from 13.6 per 1,000 to 10.8 over the same period, and the trend was similar for women. \n\n'Fewer stigmas'\n\nThe average length of marriage for men aged 60 and over who got divorced in 2011 was 27.4 years, the ONS found. Women over 60 who divorced in the same year had been married for an average of 31.9 years.\n\nThe overall number of divorces has been falling since the mid-1990s after reaching a peak of 165,000 in 1993 - 22 years after divorce law reform made it easier to split.\n\nIn 2011, the total number of divorces was 118,000. Of these, 9,500 were granted to men aged 60 - a 73% rise from 1991.\n\nAlthough husbands tend to be older than their wives, officials noted, the trend was similar for women: 5,800 women over 60 divorced in 2011, up from 3,200 in 1991.\n\nThe ONS cited US-based academic research from Bowling Green State University, Ohio, to offer possible explanations for the trend. \n\nBecause of increasing life expectancies, the ONS said,\"even with a small chance of divorce during each year of marriage, marriages are now more likely to end in divorce and less likely to end in the death of one spouse than they were in 1991.\"\n\nAs it has become more common to be divorced, it added, there are fewer stigmas attached.\n\nIt noted:\"The employment rate of women aged 16 to 64 rose from 53% in 1971 to 66% in 2012. \n\n\"This means that women have become more financially independent and are more likely to have built up their own pensions. \n\n\"Therefore, in general, women are now more able to support themselves outside of marriage than in the past.\"\n\n'Empty nest syndrome'\n\nRuth Sutherland, the chief executive of relationship charity Relate, said:\"It is clear from today's statistics that there are many pressures facing couples as they grow older.\n\n\"Relationships are often missing in the current debate on our ageing society but 83% of people we surveyed aged over 50 told us that strong personal relationships were the most important factor to a happy later life. \n\n\"This data shows once again that this is a very real issue for many older people.\"\n\nLouise Halford, a family law specialist at law firm Irwin Mitchell, said:\"This increase is unsurprising considering trends seen across the past few years.\n\n\"It is unfortunate but simply not uncommon in modern times to see couples drift apart as a result of'empty nest syndrome', when their children head off to university or move out of the family home.\n\n\"This can have a major impact on the dynamic between a couple and bring issues to the fore which may have been hidden by their continued responsibilities to their offspring.\n\n\"Of course, another issue is that people are also living healthier, longer lives and simply wish to pursue other relationships. In the past, people may have felt compelled to stay together in old age.\n\n\"However, these days if people are in an unhappy relationship at 60, they may consider carefully whether they want to spend another 25 years or more living with that person.\"\nTL;DR: The number of over-60s in England and Wales who are getting divorced is rising, the Office for National Statistics has said.\n\nArticle: In the selected areas farmers have been licensed to shoot badgers over a six week period sometime after 1 June.\n\nThose carrying out the cull have been set a target of reducing the local badger population by 70% which, previous culls suggest, could reduce cattle in TB by at least 16% over the long term.\n\nThe policy is in marked contrast to the one pursued by the Welsh government, which has just embarked on the second year of a badger vaccination programme in a disease hotspot in north Pembrokeshire.  \n\nBadgers and cattle are both susceptible to TB and it is widely believed that to eradicate the disease in cattle it must also be tackled in the wildlife population.  \n\nBut any consensus breaks down on whether culling or vaccinating badgers is the best way to do that.  \n\nThe BBC Radio Wales current affairs series Eye on Wales has been talking to both sides of the debate on either side of the border.\n\nSTEPHEN JAMES\n\nNFU Cymru's TB spokesman, he farms 500 dairy cattle in Pembrokeshire, close to the Intensive Action Area where the Welsh government has recently resumed catching and vaccinating badgers.\n\n\"It's ridiculous really to go and try and cure something, when they know that there's significant disease in there, at a cost of \u00a3620 a badger annually. [Last year] they spent a million pounds in less than 300 sq km (115 sq miles).\n\n\"That's a very expensive way of trying to control this disease when we know full well, from experience from other countries, that there are cheaper ways of doing it.\"\n\n\"We feel that if you vaccinate in the clean areas, around the edges of the endemic areas, then there's a better chance of it working.\"\n\nLives in Chepstow.  A director of the Badger Trust national charity.\n\n\"Vaccination has been proved in studies to have an impact on the spread of TB amongst badgers.  \n\n\"The vaccine is obviously looking to protect clean animals, but it also reduces the bacilli that is excreted by infected badgers. It doesn't cure them, but it reduces the possibility of any further infection.\n\n\"No vaccine is 100% effective but we're talking in the region of a 75% level of protection.  \n\n\"When that size of the population is being protected then the chances of picking up the disease are very slim.\n\n\"The life span of a badger is about five years. \n\n\"So if you continue the vaccination project for five years, then the majority of animals that were there at the beginning will have died out and that vaccination programme is leading towards a clean and healthy badger population.\"\n\nChairman of the Gloucestershire Badger Group.\n\n\"You have got to be a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot. It's got to be a high-velocity deer-stalking type of rifle with one bullet. \n\n\"That bullet has got to hit the mark first time.\n\n\"Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc.\n\n\"We are going to have a lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground.\n\n\"This is a well-known area for holidaymakers - they could be in fear of being shot.  \n\n\"Dogs, cats, black and white dogs [could be mistaken for badgers] - these men have to be very good marksmen to do the job properly.\"\n\nThe NFU's TB spokesman, he has a beef and arable farm near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He is also a nominal director of Gloscon, the company set up by local farmers to employ contractors to carry out the cull in the west of Gloucestershire.\n\n\"I would expect to see a reduction of TB in our cull area - certainly by year three and four - of something like 60 or 70% - not the 16% that is being talked about.\n\n\"I have no worries at all about the safety of the cull.  All these contractors that are doing the job have undergone thorough training.\n\n\"They know that safety is absolutely the number one condition that they operate under. If there's any sign of danger or risk of anything, they won't take a shot.\n\n\"They have shown their competence through demonstrated target practice.  \n\n\"They know the physiology of badgers; they know where they have got to be aiming. They do this with foxes and other animals and do it quite cleanly.\n\n\"Every form of culling every animal is open to an element of welfare distress on occasion, but the aim is always to keep that to an absolute minimum.\"\n\nEye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales at 13.30 BST on Sunday, 19 May and can be heard on the BBC iPlayer for seven days.\nTL;DR: In a few weeks' time the government in England will press ahead with trials of badger culls in parts of Gloucestershire and Somerset as part of its strategy to eradicate TB in cattle.   \n\n\n\nArticle: Riyaz Naikoo had taken over command of the banned Hizbul Mujahideen group, succeeding Burhan Wani who was killed by security forces in 2016.\n\nWani's death triggered massive protests in the region, which is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan. \n\nThe region has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, which has flared following Wani's killing.\n\nNaikoo was shot dead in his home village of Beigh Pora in Pulwama district after militants killed eight security personnel in two separate attacks, part of a recent surge of violence in Indian-administered Kashmir. \n\nLocals said the militant leader had been trapped in a joint siege laid by army, paramilitary and police forces.

Gabbana and his long-time business partner Domenico Dolce, who were a couple for more than two decades, managed to irritate several different groups of people in an interview with Panorama (an Italian news magazine not to be confused with the BBC series of the same name).\"We oppose gay adoptions,\"they say.\"The only family is the traditional one.\"\n\nThey also criticise IVF and surrogate parents:\"No chemical offspring and rented uterus: life has a natural flow, there are things that should not be changed.\"\n\n\"You are born to a mother and a father - or at least that's how it should be,\"Dolce says.\"I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented uterus, semen chosen from a catalogue.\"\n\nSoon people were posting pictures of their children conceived through IVF and tweeting support for gay marriage. Sir Elton John, who has two children with husband David Furnish,  led the charge on Instagram. Next to a picture of the designers, he writes:\"How dare you refer to my beautiful children as'synthetic'. And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children.\"He signed off with:\"#BoycottDolceGabbana\"\n\nGabbana seemed to take the criticism to heart, and since the controversy took off he's posted dozens of pictures and comments to shore up his argument. At one point he played on a slogan popular in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks and declared\"Je Suis D&G\". And in another he posted a picture of a woman and a child along with the words:\"#dgmamma #dgfamily.\"\n\nIn a post Monday Gabbana shouted\"Fascist!\"and took direct aim at the singer:\"#boycotteltonjohn\". On his Instagram account, as you might expect, there was quite a lot of support for his criticism of Elton John among the hundreds of comments.

Aaron Paul keeps turning my console on\u2026 #stooooop\"\n\nThe effect has also been noted on news discussion site Reddit's Xbox section, with one commentator writing:\"Damn commercial keeps turning on my xbox! Lol\"\n\nThe post reflects the attitude of many console owners who have posted about the matter who appear more bemused than angered by the glitch.\n\nThis is not the first time such an effect has been reported. \n\nIn November Xbox One owner Tim Kimberl posted a video to YouTube showing that an internet ad that featured the command\"Xbox go to Dead Rising 3\"launched the game on his system.\n\nUsers affected by the issue do have the ability to turn off the Kinect sensor, which prevents the console responding to voice commands.\n\nThe issue has parallels with an effect played for laughs in the TV series 30 Rock where a voice-controlled television went haywire when on-screen characters mentioned its trigger words.\n\nUnbundled Kinect\n\nThe problem has arisen in the same week that Microsoft began selling a cheaper version of the Xbox One without the Kinect.\n\nIt said it made the move - timed to coincide with the E3 video games expo - following feedback from gamers who did not want to pay extra for the accessory.\n\nThe decision allows the machine to retail at the same price as Sony's PlayStation 4.\n\nMicrosoft's press event at the Los Angeles show was notable for hardly featuring the Kinect. \n\nOnly a dancing game, a Disney motion-controlled music rhythm title, and an indie game called Fru - which allows players to control a character by making body shapes - appeared to take advantage of the feature.\n\nHowever, Microsoft did announce outside the show that a software update would soon allow developers access to more graphics power when the Kinect was not in use. This may help address complaints that several cross-platform games offer higher resolutions and frame rates on the PS4 than their Xbox equivalents.\n\nHowever, the new ad signals that the US firm intends to keep promoting the Kinect as a feature that distinguishes its machine from its Japanese rival's, even if the price quoted at its end is for the standalone machine.\nTL;DR: Xbox One owners are complaining that a new TV advert is switching their consoles on without their permission.\n\nArticle: But Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say it is\"simply not true\"they are in litigation with the government and it is a\"poor excuse\".\n\nThey have repeated their demand for a meeting with the PM to discuss their call for an inquiry into the pandemic.\n\nDowning Street said it had nothing to add to the PM's comments.\n\nCovid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice say they have written five times to Mr Johnson to request a meeting.\n\nAsked about the letters, in a live TV interview last week, the prime minister said he would\"of course\"meet anyone bereaved by Covid-19.\n\nBut days later he wrote to the group to say he was\"unable\"to meet them.\n\n'Frustration'\n\nThe group, which says it represents 1,600 families, said it was\"devastated\"to receive the letter, which it has made public.\n\nAt Prime Minister's Questions, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer - who met the group in July - asked if Mr Johnson would change his mind, saying the PM\"will understand the frustration and the hurt of those families that he said one thing to camera and another thing to them\".\n\nMr Johnson said:\"Of course I would be very happy to meet the families of the bereaved and sympathise deeply with all those who have lost loved ones throughout this pandemic and we all feel their pain and their grief.\n\n\"It turns out that this particular group are currently in litigation with the government.

The outbreaks have sparked fears that, as the scramble for votes intensifies ahead of the March 2013 poll, the killings could herald another bloody election season. \n\nPolitical interference\n\nFollowing the 2007 election and its violent aftermath, a power-sharing government was eventually formed in February 2008 - but by then at least 1,000 people had been killed and tens of thousands displaced.\n\nThe violence was so serious that former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan flew into Nairobi to steer meetings between the two main political parties' leaders, the Orange Democratic Movement's Raila Odinga and the encumbent, Mwai Kibaki of the Party of National Unity.\n\nA referendum on a new constitution in August 2010 produced a resounding\"yes\"vote, devolving power and establishing a bill of rights. \n\nBut efforts to set up a local tribunal to prosecute suspects of the election killings were blocked by the politicians who were implicated. \n\nSo were attempts to undertake land reform, police reform and enact the Integrity and Leadership Bill. Other ambitious reforms whose need had been exposed by the election were not pushed through.\n\nThe big debate now is about the two politicians who are due to appear before the International Criminal Court at The Hague just weeks after the 2013 election, charged with displacing, torturing, persecuting and killing civilians during Kenya's election crisis.\n\nFormer finance minister Uhuru Kenyatta, and William Ruto, arguably Kenya's most divisive political figure, both deny the charges and are still running for president.\n\nMr Ruto is widely accused of instigating violence but revered as a hero within his ethnic community, the Kalenjin. \n\nMr Kenyatta is the son of Kenya's former leader Jomo Kenyatta.\n\nTheir presence in the electoral contest has raised fears of fresh violence. And Mr Annan - on hand to mediate after the previous election - last week warned the country was in danger of spiralling into serious violence once more.\n\nDeep inequality\n\nOf course, Kenyan elections have often triggered clashes between tribes, as political parties tend to draw support from particular ethnic groups.\n\nBut Kenya's violent past interacts toxically with another contributing factor: Deep inequality, especially between different regions. It is that, rather than poverty, which sparks political violence and crime. Official unemployment hovers around the 40% mark, with young people the worst affected. Tribal rivalries can easily cause tensions to spill over.\n\nMeanwhile, the political elite continue to award themselves higher salaries and perks - considered the highest - against a backdrop of  increasing labour unrest and strikes by doctors and teachers. \n\nOne of the many shortcomings of Kenyan society since the electoral violence has been its failure to takes the effects of the fighting seriously enough. The sheer relief that accompanied the arrival of the peace pact gave way to an unspoken belief that all was now relatively calm.\n\nThe truth is that thousands of those internally displaced during the violence are still in makeshift camps, four years on. \n\nDuring the post-election crisis, there was state-directed violence against civilians, fighting amongst various civilian factions, and uprisings against the state by civilians.\n\nAs a recent report concluded, Kenya has not yet healed. The report says both the victims and the perpetrators of violence are still trapped in the after-effects of the fighting, without undergoing a healing and reconciliation process. \n\nThe belated Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, set up three years ago, has yet to release findings and recommendations, adding fuel to the widely-held belief that the coalition administration is not serious in bringing closure to the election's events.\n\nPart of the reason for this could be that this time the stakes are even higher.\n\nScarred country\n\nIn March, Kenyans will vote for county governors and senators for the first time. More power will be up for grabs, this time at a local level. This could lead to intense competition and rivalry, raising the likelihood of more violence.\n\nAnd back in the Tana, a new threat to peace is emerging. Investors, both Kenyan and foreign, are acquiring leases on vast tracts of land for large-scale crop cultivation for food and bio-fuels. \n\nDeeply scarred and limping into new elections, Kenya could be showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress on a large scale. \n\nAnd it won't take much to make things worse.\n\nGray Phombeah is a Kenyan writer and broadcaster.\nTL;DR: Four years after the worst political crisis since it gained independence in 1963, pre-election tensions are mounting in Kenya.

There have been calls for the agency to be mandated to go into countries very early in outbreaks, to carry out independent investigations.  \n\nChina has said it supports a\"comprehensive evaluation\"of the global response, but only after the virus is contained. That could take months - or even years.\n\nWhat is being discussed at the assembly?\n\nThe European Union, alongside countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, has been pushing for an inquiry into how the pandemic has been handled and what lessons can be learned.\n\nEU spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said several key questions needed to be answered as part of any review.\n\n\"How did this pandemic spread? What is the epidemiology behind it? All this is absolutely crucial for us going forward to avoid another pandemic of this kind,\"she said.\n\nHowever, she added that now was not the time for\"any sort of blame game\". \n\nA draft resolution calling for a review, to be put to a vote on Tuesday, requires a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nLast month, an EU report accused China of spreading disinformation about the crisis.\n\nThe bloc's External Action Service said Russia, and to a lesser extent China, had promoted\"conspiracy narratives\".\n\nSeparately, member states agreed on Monday to delay discussions over granting Taiwan observer status for assembly meetings, with Taipei saying that it would defer its demand until later in the year.\n\nChina, which says Taiwan is part of its territory, has blocked Taiwan's attendance since 2016. \n\nIn recent weeks, the US, EU, Japan and several other nations have backed Taiwan's bid to attend the meeting.\n\nDuring Monday's talks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said excluding Taiwan\"further damages\"the credibility of the WHO.\n\nWhat are the accusations against China?\n\nThe outbreak first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and was widely reported to have originated in a food market.\n\nSince then, however, some senior US politicians have suggested that the source was a research facility in Wuhan that had been carrying out research on bat coronaviruses. China has dismissed the idea.\n\nMr Pompeo said earlier this month that there was\"a significant amount of evidence\"that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan.

though it would have to be something really special in the short term to actually buy it.\"\n\nElizabeth is worried about where donations may have come from.\"Will future donors have to ID the donations for traceability?\"she asked. \n\nShe is also concerned that the virus may last on cardboard or paper.\n\n\"I'd leave a book outside for a day or two in the sun - and even then I would wipe the cover and spine down before bringing it in.\"\n\nCharity stores will be introducing extra hygiene to reassure customers, said Vicki Burnett.\n\n\"They already have great hygiene processes in their shops when it comes to sorting goods - items are washed, steamed or cleaned and this will only increase in the current situation.\"\n\nGoods that come in will be isolated for 72 hours before being sorted.\nTL;DR: Charity shops fear they will be deluged by donations when they start to reopen in just over two weeks.\n\nArticle: Dr Kamaljit Singh, who practises in Leicester, sent three packages containing needles to an unnamed patient from Manchester.\n\nThe woman then tried to drain fluid from her abdomen, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.\n\nThe panel said the medic's behaviour was\"reckless and irresponsible\".\n\nThe patient ended up with an\"accumulation of fat and tissue\"at the top of her stomach after she failed to properly drain fluid following the surgery at the Beauty First Clinic in Leicester, in May 2013, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nDr Singh, who now practises as a GP principal at Thurmaston Health Centre, told panel members that he had\"a desire to please others in order to avoid rejection\".\n\nThe tribunal accepted this may have played a part in his decision to agree to the patient treating herself so she did not have to travel from Manchester.\n\n'Hun' and'babes'\n\nTribunal chair Robin Ince said the doctor's actions had the\"potential to increase the risk of infection or cause accidental self-harm to the patient\".\n\nDespite this, the tribunal concluded no further action was necessary.\n\nDr Singh was also found found guilty of carrying out surgical procedures when he was not registered with health regulators the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\n\nPanel members also heard of\"inappropriate\"text messages he sent to patients, addressing some women as\"hun\"and\"babes\". \n\nOne message read\"miss your smiley face\",\"your an angel\"and another said\"hun u can sort dosh out with my wife am xx\".\n\nHe was also criticised for not offering women chaperones during potentially intimate examinations. \n\nNone of the women complained about Dr Singh's conduct.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Instead it makes money by selling data on those deals to others before they go through.\n\nSome hedge funds have lost out on the rise in GameStop's shares because they had shorted the stock. This is where an investor tries to make money by betting a company's share price will fall.\n\nAnd Mr Musk questioned to what degree Robinhood was\"beholden to\"Citadel Securities, which is its biggest client. Citadel has suffered losses as a result of an investment in a hedge fund that had taken a large short position on GameStop.\n\nMr Musk has previously been critical of short selling, claiming it to be a\"legal\"scam.\n\nMr Tenev acknowledged that there had been\"a rumour that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into\"putting restriction on trades, but added the claim was\"just false\".\n\n\u201cRobinhood stands for, you know, democratising access to stocks,\u201d he said on Clubhouse. \n\n\u201cWe want to give people the access\u2026 but we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements.\u201d\n\nMr Musk asked in response: \u201cDid you sell your clients down the river, or [did] you have no choice?\u201d\n\nMr Tenev repeated that Robinhood had to comply with financial requirements.\n\nHe said this involved an order from the National Securities Clearing Corporation - a clearing house used by the company - to provide\"around $3bn\"to back up its trades. He added the demand was later reduced to $700m.\n\nMr Tenev conceded, however, that Robinhood needed to be more transparent.\n\n\u201cWe were able to open and serve our customers,\"he said, adding that Robinhood had raised more than $1bn within 24 hours.\n\n\"When we do open [on Monday]... we'll be able to kind of relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.\"\n\n'Broad acceptance'\n\nMr Musk also came out in support of Bitcoin, saying he thought it was on \u201cthe verge of getting a broad acceptance\u201d by conventional finance.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has surged in value in recent months, but some experts say it is volatile and will crash soon.\n\n\u201cI should have at least bought some Bitcoin eight years ago,\u201d Mr Musk said on Clubhouse. \n\n\u201cTalk about being late to the party.\n\n\u201cI was a little slow on the uptake there\u2026 but I do at this point think Bitcoin is a good thing - I am a supporter of Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe price of one bitcoin rose to above $34,000 on Monday morning, up from $33,000, following Mr Musk's comments.\n\nLife on Mars\n\nThe SpaceX head also said human travel to Mars will be possible within five-and-a-half years - and outlined his vision to relocate some humans there from Earth.\n\n\u201cI think the important part is just that we get people there,\u201d Mr Musk added. \n\n\u201cAnd we get the equipment necessary to establish a self-sustaining civilisation.\u201d\n\nHe also said he believed he could get the journey time to the Red Planet down from six months to one month.\n\nBrain implants\n\nAnother of Mr Musk\u2019s projects, Neuralink, received attention in the interview.\n\nThe start-up explores ways to connect the human brain to a computer interface.\n\n\u201cIn simplistic terms, I'd say it's sort of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires,\u201d Mr Musk said.\n\nIt implanted a chip in a pig\u2019s brain last August, and Mr Musk revealed the company now had a monkey that could control video games via a brain implant.\n\n\u201cHe's totally happy,\u201d he said of the monkey. \u201cIt does not look like an unhappy monkey. \n\n\"And you can't even see where the neural implant was put in. Except that he's got like a slight like dark mohawk - it's not uncomfortable. It doesn't look weird.\u201d\n\nMr Musk said he hoped the technology could be used, in early applications, for humans with serious brain injuries. \n\nHowever, some experts have previously challenged the work of the firm.\nTL;DR: Tesla boss Elon Musk has grilled trading app Robinhood's co-founder, Vladimir Tenev, about why it limited users to only being able to buy a small number of shares in some companies.\n\nArticle: A charity looking after the 629 migrants on the Aquarius, stranded off Malta, says two Italian ships will help take them to Spain's port of Valencia.\n\nSpain is some three days' sailing away.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hit back angrily at France, calling its stance on migrants\"hypocritical\".\n\nHe criticised\"countries that have always preferred to turn their backs when it comes to immigration\". \n\nIn the past five years Italy has taken in more than 640,000 mainly African migrants and says its EU partners must ease the burden.\n\nMost migrants who survive the perilous voyages from North Africa end up in overcrowded Italian camps. Among them are refugees fleeing war and persecution, who have a right to asylum.\n\nThe Aquarius migrants, mainly sub-Saharan Africans, were picked up off Libya's coast at the weekend.\n\nThey were found in inflatable boats and are now being looked after by Doctors without Borders (MSF) and the Franco-German charity SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e aboard the Aquarius.\n\nMr Macron's spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the French president recalled that\"in cases of distress, those with the nearest coastline have a responsibility to respond\". \n\n\"There is a degree of cynicism and irresponsibility in the Italian government's behaviour,\"he quoted President Macron as saying.\n\nThe plan is for the Aquarius to be joined by an Italian coastguard ship and a warship, then for all three to head for Valencia.\n\nThe coastguard ship Dattilo and the warship are expected to take migrants on board from the Aquarius in the coming hours. There are medics and UN Children's Fund (Unicef) workers on the Dattilo.\n\nSOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e tweeted photos of fresh supplies arriving on board on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier the crew said the ship could not sail to Spain while it was overcrowded, and conditions at sea were deteriorating. \n\nAmong the migrants are seven pregnant women, 11 young children and 123 unaccompanied minors. \n\nThe minors are aged between 13 and 17 and come from Eritrea, Ghana, Nigeria and Sudan, according to a journalist on the ship, Anelise Borges.\n\nFifteen migrants have serious chemical burns and several suffered hypothermia, according to MSF.\n\nItaly defiant\n\nItalian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio shrugged off the French criticism.\"I'm glad the French have discovered responsibility: if they want, we will help them,\"he said.\"Let them open their ports and we will transfer a few of the people to France.\"\n\nEarlier, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini defended his refusal to let the ship dock, saying: \"Saving lives is a duty, turning Italy into a huge refugee camp is not.\"Instead he urged Malta to receive the migrants.\n\nHis right-wing League party is in a new populist government which has pledged to stop the migrant influx to Italy and deport failed asylum seekers.\n\nHowever, the Italian coastguard ship Diciotti is currently taking 937 migrants to the Sicilian port of Catania. They were picked up not by charities but by the EU naval rescue mission off Libya.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who took office a week ago, said he would give\"safe harbour\"to the Aquarius, after Italy and Malta had refused.\n\nThe nationalist authorities on the French island of Corsica also offered to receive the Aquarius, before the latest plan involving Italian ships was announced.\n\nAid worker Aloys Vimard, also on board, told the BBC the migrants were afraid they would be returned to Libya.\n\nWhat is the law on accepting ships?\n\nRules on disembarking and assisting rescue ships such as Aquarius are governed by international law.\n\nThe International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIt says that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship.\n\nIt also clearly states that the relevant government\"shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable\".\n\nA big question for Spain: What happens to the next ship?\n\nBy Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, BBC News \n\nThe EU wrote its rules about how migrants should be handled in the 1990s, when no-one could have imagined the collapse of Libya would create huge flows of desperate people heading across the Mediterranean from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe rules say migrants are the responsibility of the first member state where they land - an overwhelming problem in countries like Greece and Italy, where the election of a populist government is at least in part a response to the pressure. \n\nAnd when Matteo Salvini proclaims\"victory\", he's telling his voters that the promise of a tougher line on immigration is real. \n\nHe is challenging the EU to find a proper solution too, based on forcing other member states to accept quotas of migrants - something it has failed to do so far. And he's incidentally created a big question for Spain. Will its offer to the Aquarius be extended to more ships in the future?\nTL;DR: French President Emmanuel Macron has accused the Italian government of \"cynicism and irresponsibility\" for refusing to let a stranded rescue ship packed with migrants dock in Italy.\n\nArticle: By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education and social affairs reporter \n\nBut two years on, the views of 18- and 19-year-olds in this strongly pro-Leave area are pretty striking. \n\nWhen asked how they feel about the vote to leave the EU, there's one overriding emotion: anger - at the fact nobody asked them what they thought.\n\nIt's not that they have not been heard, says Jeevan, 18, it's that they have not been allowed to speak.\n\n\"It's annoying,\"says 19-year-old catering student Morgan,\"that the people who voted for this aren't going to be dealing with the fallout for as long as us.\"\n\n'Decided for us'  \n\nGemma, also 19 and studying catering, says:\"I feel annoyed because it's about the jobs really.\n\n\"And it's going to be harder because of everything that's happening.\"\n\nHer friend Zoe, who wants to open a bakery, thinks her dream will be harder to realise as a result of Brexit.\n\nJohnny, who travelled to Europe for two weeks as part of his course, says:\"I feel anger that other people aren't going to get the opportunity that we have had.\"\n\nDaniel, 17, says he originally supported Leave but now he's not so sure.\n\nOf the adults who backed Brexit, he says:\"If they want their children to lose out like that then that's on them.\"\n\nJohnny says:\"We don't really have a say in anything right now - will we have a say in the future?\n\n\"Our future was decided for us basically.\"\n\nThere is also a sense among these particular students that opportunities will be more limited than they have been.\n\nCoventry already has the highest proportion of learners in further education that are from the most deprived background.\n\nEveryday racism\n\nAyanda, 18, who is studying health and social care, wanted to travel the world working as a midwife and gaining experience along the way.\n\nShe says:\"I wanted to start out in Australia - that's OK. But then I wanted to go to countries in the EU but I think Brexit means it will be more difficult to go and get a job there.\"\n\nShe then planned to come back to England to work, but says she would start a family somewhere else.\n\nShe agrees with the others that immigration was a big driver of the vote.\n\n\"I felt like the 50% that voted for Brexit didn't want immigrants here. Most of it is to do with racism,\"she says.\n\n\"I experience racism on a daily basis - it's less than it was but it's still there.\n\n\"This is my country but I feel like the people who voted for Brexit wanted to get the migrants out of Britain.\"\n\nAnd later she admits to being very scared about the future.\n\n'Taking our jobs'\n\nJo Gaffney, a youth worker at the college, says she has seen racism raise its ugly head since the vote.\n\n\"In Coventry there's a lot of young people joining far-right groups,\"she says.\"We do a lot of work around that.\n\n\"What we saw was at the time of the vote was that some of these views were legitimised.\n\n\"A lot of people could suddenly say things that they had kept to themselves for ages.\n\n\"Now people think it's OK to hate migrants.\n\n\"You could hear it from the way young people were talking.\"\n\nShe adds:\"I hear things now that I haven't heard since the 1980s.\"\n\nJohnny, who came from Latvia with his parents when he was aged 11, says:\"When people say all that about,'They're coming here and taking our jobs,' the thing is that these jobs were there beforehand anyway - people just hadn't applied for them. \n\n\"The jobs were there to be taken.\"\n\nJake, 17, who is the one person in the group who has a more positive attitude towards Brexit, says:\"I've grown up in Coventry, which is a multicultural city. \n\n\"We are the ['UK] City of Culture 2021 - we wouldn't have been given it without immigration.\n\n\"I have gone to multicultural schools all my life.

They would ask them questions. \n\n\"They would deliberate with one another and the key thing here is talking to people who have different views from them.\"\n\nBuilding Change Trust has offered \u00a3100,000 to Involve - a charitable think-tank - to conduct the Northern Ireland operation. \n\nThe donation is conditional on Involve raising additional funding to deliver the project, but this is expected to happen.\n\n\"We hope that the experience of this citizens' assembly will encourage the Northern Ireland Assembly to establish a citizens' assembly to support their decision making,\"said Involve director Tim Hughes. \n\nQuintin Oliver from the Belfast-based public affairs consultancy, Stratagem, is helping to advise those behind the plan for a citizens' assembly. \n\n\"I think you would be surprised how 100 ordinary people could very quickly come to practical, pragmatic, achievable solutions and the politicians could be very grateful for that help,\"he said.\n\nPoliticians from all the main parties have been briefed about the idea of a citizens' assembly.\n\nIt is expected that the body, which will have no official status, could be up and running within months. \n\nPolitical debate\n\nLast weekend, Green Party MLA Steven Agnew joined Sinn F\u00e9in's Emma Rogan and the DUP'S Jim Wells and observed the Irish assembly which sits at Malahide, near Dublin.\n\nMr Agnew, who is an advocate of the idea, believes a citizens' body could assist with political debate in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"I hear politicians say all the time what most people believe,\"he said.\n\n\"We don't know what most people believe but actually a citizens' assembly is a good way of testing that.\"\n\nHowever, DUP MLA Jim Wells is concerned about what a Northern Ireland version might consider. \n\n\"In the Irish Republic the Citizens' Assembly has been used as a sounding board for controversial social issues such as a redefinition of marriage and change in the abortion legislation,\"he said.\n\n\"Those decisions should be made by elected representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly. They are incredibly important and they are incredibly controversial.\n\n\"They should be best made by elected representatives, rather than a group that is not answerable to the electorate.\"    \n\n  Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Emma Rogan said citizens' assemblies were no substitute for democratically elected bodies and legislatures.\n\n\"When a citizens' assembly makes recommendations it is important that there is a mechanism to ensure that these issues are considered by relevant legislatures.

You have this vacuum right now why not use this opportunity that the vacuum has created to try something like this,\"he said.\n\n\"We are showing south of the border that something like this can work so why not try it north of the border as well.\"\n\nYou can see more about the proposed Northern Ireland citizens' assembly on The View on Thursday at 22:40 GMT on BBC One NI.\nTL;DR: Plans for a Citizens' Assembly for Northern Ireland are advanced and it is hoped the body will be up and running this year.\n\nArticle: The Saints Trails project for 30km (18 miles) of cycleways was to cost \u00a319.1m but is now expected to hit \u00a325m, auditors told Cornwall Council.\n\nAuditors also said the\"high risk\"project would miss the deadline for completion.\n\nHowever, a Cornwall Council director says he is\"absolutely determined\"the project will be delivered on budget.\n\nAuditors added the scheme had not been managed in the way such a high profile venture should.\n\nThe project linking Newquay, Perranporth, St Newlyn East, St Agnes and Truro was launched in 2019.\n\nFunding included \u00a317.1m from Highways England and \u00a32m from the council but the\"total forecast spend is likely to be circa \u00a325m\", said an auditors report which will be considered by councillors later, the LDRS reported.\n\nThe Highways England funding had originally included a requirement to be spent by March 2021 but the council has negotiated to extend that to March 2022.\n\nHowever, the report to the audit committee states that it may not be able to meet that deadline.\n\nAuditors said the need to use compulsory purchase powers of land to build the routes may mean that the land is not acquired until June 2023.\n\nAuditors said that the initial timeline for the project\"failed to take into account the timescales involved for the Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPOs) and potential public inquiries to acquire the required land for the proposed routes\".\n\nCouncil director Phil Mason said the \u00a35m forecast overspend would only occur if all the risks highlighted came to fruition. \n\nIf the project looked likely to go over budget, the director said he would take action to reduce costs, but admitted that could mean the trails would not be as high quality as originally envisaged.\n\nFollow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram or get in touch with us by email at spotlight@bbc.co.uk.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nSaints Trails\nTL;DR: A plan to create four new cycle trails in Cornwall has run more than \u00a35m over budget.\n\nArticle: By Mark NormanBBC South East Health Correspondent \n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) is due to publish its latest findings on Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust on Wednesday.\n\nBut sources have told the BBC the CQC will recommend the trust goes into special measures.\n\nNeither the trust or CQC would comment ahead of publication of the report on Wednesday.\n\nThe trust runs the Royal Sussex hospital in Brighton and the Princess Royal in Haywards Heath. \n\nIt means the leadership of the trust will be rated as inadequate and it is expected a number of other serious issues will be highlighted by inspectors.\n\nThe CQC will demand such issues are sorted out quickly.\n\nAfter its last inspection in June 2015, Brighton's A&E was rated as unsafe.\n\nThe trust has been consistently one of the worst performers in England on a number of key performance indicators. \n\nIn particular, it's A&E department has seen a consistent rise in the number of people coming through its doors. \n\nThe trust is also struggling financially with a potential deficit at the end of this financial year of more than \u00a370m.\n\nThis will be another blow for staff, who were praised in the last CQC report for their care and commitment. \n\nThe trust is currently in the middle of a \u00a3480m redevelopment and has said changes have already been made to address concerns raised in previous inspections.\nTL;DR: A hospital trust already rated inadequate is about to be placed into special measures, the BBC understands.\n\nArticle: By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg\n\nJudging by the tumultuous events of the last few weeks it seems like Nelson Mandela's peaceful revolution is about to give birth to its opposite number. \n\nCovering one of the many protests, I marched with Julius Malema and his thousands of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) through Johannesburg. \n\nAll I could see was a sea of red t-shirts in the streets of the city of gold.  \n\nWe began our march from Mary Fitzgerald Square. The protest grew into the biggest march seen in the city in recent times as we walked to the South African Reserve Bank branch, our first stop. \n\nThe cantankerous Mr Malema told the bank officials who were brave enough to come out and receive the memorandum, that he wanted zero charges on bank fees for the poor and the aged. \n\nIn the scorching heat we then proceeded to the Chamber of Mines. \n\nAs usual, he did not hold back when he told the chamber's official that the EFF wants to\"nationalise the mines\". \n\nI asked Malema how many years he plans to keep marching against the ruling ANC. \n\nHe told me:\"It won't be long. We want to own the means of production. The time of the ANC is over.\"\n\nIt was when he reached the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, in Africa's richest square mile Sandton, that he showed his true colours. \n\nHe told Stock Exchange CEO Nicky Newton-King:\"We are not Mandela. We do not preach reconciliation. We want remorse.\"\n\nAnd it is precisely because of this line that I asked myself the question: Are we at the cusp of the second revolution?\n\nStudent protests\n\nBut this is not just about Malema. This is about the people of the Republic of South Africa. \n\nI also walked with university students from Wits and UJ (University of Johannesburg) who were campaigning against a rise in fees.\n\nChanting a 21st century slogan #FeesMustFall, this was an organic uprising - similar to one I witnessed in Soweto back in June 1976. \n\nI saw something I had never witnessed in South African politics. There was no ANC or any other political party that was behind the protest. \n\nThe students took it upon themselves to lead their own struggle without any political party influence.\n\nIn fact, they were marching against the ANC, the oldest liberation movement on the African continent. \n\nIt felt to me like a country truly coming of age. After 21 years, South Africans were rising against the party credited with delivering freedom from white minority rule.\n\nThe students ended up right at the top, marching to the seat of power in the nation's capital in Pretoria. \n\nThey demanded that President Jacob Zuma come down from his office at the Union Buildings to address them. \n\nHe was locked in a long meeting with university management and student leaders. \n\nSome in the crowd started burning mobile toilet facilities and breached a fence separating the masses from the riot police. \n\nThe police responded by firing stun grenades and tear gas. \n\nSocial movement\n\nAll of this unfolded exactly where I was standing 21 years before on 10 May when Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the first democratically-elected president of a free South Africa. \n\nPlacards were not limited to fees only. Many of them read\"down with corruption\".\n\nIt was a protest about inequality, and the lack of integrity of the government.\n\nThe question is whether the current political leadership can transform the status quo where the vast wealth of the country is concentrated in the hands of the few.\n\nService delivery protests have always been localised, but with #FeesMustFall we are seeing the birth of an embryonic national social movement.\n\nProfessor Somadoda Fikeni, an expert on the ANC, says the current leaders do not have the capacity to deal with the radical transformation of South Africa. \n\nHe told me:\"They lack a deep political conviction. Everything they do is at a technical minimum requirement of what is expected of them. They have a preoccupation of maintaining the lifestyle they possess.\n\n\"Some of them may be politically leftist, but if you look closely at their lifestyle you soon realise that they cannot change the prevailing levels of inequality.\n\n\"It is not in their interest to violently shake the tree that feeds them.\"\n\nTo understand how we got here, one has to go back to the end of apartheid.\n\nUnrealised expectations\n\nNelson Mandela negotiated a political settlement, but the people expected more than politics - they hoped for justice, equality and redistribution of wealth.\n\nBut wealth is still concentrated in the hands of the few. A recent survey by the department of trade and industry - disputed by the JSE - found only 3% of South Africa's economy is black-owned. \n\nOrdinary people are in despair, still facing high unemployment, poverty and inequality. \n\nDon't get me wrong - many achievements have come with the end of apartheid. \n\nSouth Africa has one of the largest black middle class in the world outside the US. \n\nProgrammes such as affirmative action and Broad Based Economic Empowerment have helped to lift whole communities out of poverty. \n\nHowever, there are millions of black people who are left behind, wondering whether their freedom will ever come. \n\nWhen I covered the multi-party talks soon after Mandela's release many people were repeating the same line:\"We are different. We are not like the rest of Africa.\"\n\nPart of the reason for that was the way the people had forgiven the perpetrators of apartheid through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nJulius Malema:\n\nBut now that sense of pride is slowly fading away as corruption, xenophobia and big political blunders become the order of the day. \n\nOne politician who was part of the negotiation team tells me:\"We are no different from the rest of Africa. We are ordinary. There's nothing special about us.\"\n\nLike many others at the time of euphoria, I too believed that the South African experience would be totally different from what we have witnessed in post-colonial wars on the continent.\n\nMillions remain optimistic. \n\nHowever, there are many others who think before things get better in South Africa they might have to get worse first.\nTL;DR: As South Africa enters its 22nd year since the end of apartheid it seems another revolution is at hand. Or is it?\n\nArticle: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 24, shouted\"Anwar is alive\"during jury selection for his trial at the court in Detroit.\n\nHe was apparently referring to Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born al-Qaeda recruiter killed in a drone strike last week. \n\nMr Abdulmutallab is defending himself after firing his court-appointed lawyers.\n\nIn a September pre-trial hearing, the accused called out\"Osama's alive\", and refused to stand up for a judge.

The way I look at this, I don't just take an instant decision.\n\n\"I actually look at the evidence, take the advice, consider it properly and then come to a decision.\n\n\"I have been very clear that I will be doing that and taking a decision some time this month.\"\n\n Mrs May will meet Chinese president Xi Jinping after the G20 summit in Hangzhou concludes on Monday.\nTL;DR: Prime Minister Theresa May has defended the delay on whether to give the go-ahead to Hinkley Point.\n\nArticle: The Bank of Scotland research said the Aberdeenshire port had seen an increase of 160% since 2001.\n\nFellow Aberdeenshire town Inverurie was second at 142%, followed by Montrose in Angus at 135%.\n\nEdinburgh was rated Scotland's most expensive area, followed by Aberdeen and then Inverurie.\n\nHelensburgh, at 51%, and Coatbridge, at 59%, were the two towns which recorded the smallest price gains.\n\nLochgelly in Fife was rated the least expensive town.\n\nMartin Ellis, housing economist at Bank of Scotland, said:\"When looking at property prices on a square metre basis, there has been a significant divergence in house price performance across Scotland over the past decade, ranging from a rise of 160% in Peterhead to 51% in Helensburgh.\n\n\"The majority of towns that have seen the highest price growth over the past decade had relatively low prices in 2001.\n\n\"Strong economic growth over the decade as a whole has also helped to drive up prices in many of those areas that have seen substantial price gains.\n\n\"This is apparent in several towns in Aberdeenshire where the economy has been stimulated by the strong performance of the oil sector.\"\nTL;DR: The fishing town of Peterhead has seen the UK's biggest property price gains over the past decade, according to new figures.\n\nArticle: The judge said the trial, due to be held in January 2021, was adjourned for\"confidential\"reasons after a request by Meghan's lawyers.\n\nThe duchess is suing the newspaper for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over the publication of a letter she wrote to her father.\n\nThe publisher denies the allegations.\n\nAssociated Newspapers - the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail and MailOnline - is being sued over five articles, from February 2019, which reproduced parts of a letter sent to Thomas Markle. \n\nThe publisher did not oppose Meghan's application for a delay but asked the judge to consider Mr Markle's situation, saying he is\"elderly and sick\"but wants and intends to give evidence at trial.\n\nMr Justice Warby said other reasons put forward by the duchess's lawyers in support of the postponement included her request for summary judgment - a legal step which would see the case resolved without a trial.\n\nThe judge granted permission for the duchess to apply for the whole case to be dismissed on the basis, her lawyers say, that the evidence in her favour is\"overwhelming\".

the delays are inexcusable and therefore it's justice that he didn't get sent to prison,\"Mr Bowen said.\n\n\"You could also argue that this is an individual who is involved in the supply of Class A drugs and that it is not justice for him not to be sent to custody.\"\n\nMr Jukes said the force was now seeing signs of this starting to affect policing as trial dates got put back further. \n\n\"We're working hard to keep the confidence of victims and keep engaged,\"he said.\n\n\"Trials that should have taken place this autumn will (now) take place in perhaps the first quarter of next year, and some that might even go beyond that.\n\n\"We are working hard with the Crown Prosecution Service, with the court service to get the best provisions in place -

Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words.\"\n\nIt says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted.\n\nGreenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK.\n\nUnique opportunity\n\nThe UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package.\n\nBack in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to\"turn the tide on climate change\".\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it called the biggest\"green\"stimulus in history.\n\nLast week, it said it planned to commit a whopping \u20ac750bn (\u00a3667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package.\n\nAdd in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.8tn; $2.2tn).\n\nFighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. \n\nThere will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.\n\nThe idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\n\"If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,\"Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC.\n\n\"The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.\"\n\nFollow Justin on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package.\n\nArticle: German Shepherd Finn was stabbed in the head and chest and handler PC Dave Wardell knifed in the hand in Denton Road, Stevenage, at about 01:15 BST.\n\nThe seriously injured dog underwent emergency surgery.

But with 8,102 deaths, it has a relatively low fatality rate.\n\nThe news is being cautiously welcomed in local media, but it comes amid concerns that picture is more bleak.\n\nA significant spike in infections in recent weeks has begun taking a toll on the healthcare system - and though India has ramped up testing, it is not uniform across the country, with some states testing much more than others.\n\nFor instance, the southern state of Tamil Nadu is testing more than 18,000 people per million, while the worst-affected state, Maharashtra, is only testing 4,688 per million. The national average is around 680 per million.\n\nInfections have been steadily climbing in the financial capital, Mumbai, and in the capital, Delhi, where officials have said that confirmed cases could top half a million by the end of July. \n\nThis has put a huge load on hospitals, with many alleging that patients with Covid-like symptoms are being turned away from private institutes due to a lack of space. \n\nThe issue is being compounded by the fact that not many people are willing to go to state hospitals despite them having some beds free. \n\nBoth Delhi and Mumbai are trying to free up more beds in private and state-run hospitals, but have warned people to take precautions and stay home as much as possible. \n\nMeanwhile, officials in the southern city of Chennai (formerly Madras) have launched an inquiry after it emerged that its death toll was underreported.\n\nA\"preliminary\"survey of the city's records have shown that at least 200 deaths have not been reflected in official data, although authorities say they do not believe the discrepancy is intentional.\nTL;DR: India says the number of total recoveries has outstripped active Covid infections for the first time.\n\nArticle: Permission was granted in February last year for developer City and County to turn Dorchester Prison into 185 homes.\n\nIt is believed Martha Brown, the last woman to be hanged in Dorset, is among former inmates buried at the site.\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes previously led calls for all bodies at the site to be exhumed.\n\nCity and Country has still not confirmed how many burial plots it plans to excavate but said those that are exhumed would be moved to Poundbury Cemetery, in agreement with Dorchester Town Council and the Diocese of Salisbury.\n\nThe Bishop of Salisbury will now produce an official order\"to remove the legal effects of the consecration so that the burials can be sensitively exhumed and presented for reburial\", the developer said.\n\nA spokesman for the diocese said any recovered bodies would be given\"a proper Christian reinternment\". \n\nThe developer previously agreed any remains at risk of being disturbed should be exhumed.\n\nIt is not known exactly how many bodies lie within or outside of the prison's consecrated burial ground at sites identified in 2015.\n\nHowever, both the council and Cotswold Archaeology, which is carrying out the archaeological works, said there were likely to be\"a lot less\"than initially thought.\n\nA number of public executions took place at the site, including that of Martha Brown -

Millions of documents were leaked, triggering legal inquiries.\n\nSome of the data contributed to Uefa's case against Manchester City, whose Champions League ban was later lifted.\n\nThe leaks to the media began in 2016.\n\nThere will be at least three court sessions per week until December at Lisbon's central criminal court, Reuters news agency reports. \n\nRui Pinto's house arrest was lifted last month and he is under a witness protection scheme, meaning he has heavy police protection for his own safety. \n\nWhat was Football Leaks?\n\nThe website - like a football version of Wikileaks - provided millions of documents and more than 3.4 terabytes of information to media outlets in the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) consortium, a network of journalists.\n\nHundreds of articles were written based on the leaked confidential data, which alleged cases of tax evasion and dubious deals involving some top football clubs and star players. Judicial investigations were launched in France, Spain, Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nThe revelations raised questions about the degree of control exercised by football's governing bodies, with allegations that huge transfer deals and club investments were poorly policed.\n\nThe data showed how wealthy Gulf Arab individuals and organisations now exercise strong influence over some top European clubs, as well as the role of offshore tax havens in football transactions.\n\nThe powerful Portuguese agent Jorge Mendes was among those investigated. \n\nJuventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, formerly of Real Madrid, is one of Mr Mendes' top clients.

The British Medical Association in Wales had also called for the use of face coverings.\n\nBut the Unite union expressed disappointment, saying face coverings should be mandatory on buses and trains.\n\nWhat kind of masks should I use and should I wash them?\n\nAccording to the Welsh Government:\n\nShould I use one if I have symptoms?\n\nSpeaking at the daily Welsh Government press briefing, Mr Gething warned that the recommendation was\"only\"for people who are not showing symptoms of coronavirus.\n\n\"People who are symptomatic must continue to self-isolate for seven days and get a test,\"he told the press conference.\n\nHe said a homemade, or bought, three-layer face covering might reduce transmission from one person to another\"if made, worn, handled and removed or disposed of properly\".\n\nHe added people should not think they can\"do what they like\"if they are wearing a face covering. Maintaining social distancing was more effective, Mr Gething said.\n\n\"Wearing a face covering cannot be an excuse for ignoring social distancing measures.\"\n\nMr Gething did not recommend that people should wear a face-covering when doing their shopping.\n\n\"When I go out and do my weekly shop, I find that people follow the rules, that the shops themselves are making sure they don't have lots of people going in\u2026 and people know about not going past each other,\"he said.\n\nWhat was the scientific advice?\n\nDespite Mr Gething's comments about shops, advice from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) said busy retailers are one setting where face coverings should be worn.\n\n\"Members of the public should be encouraged to wear face coverings only where it is difficult or not possible to observe social distancing (e.g. public transport, busy shops),\"a document from TAC said.\n\nThe group, which provides scientific advice to ministers, said coverings\"might\"reduce transmission if\"made, worn, handled and cleaned or disposed of properly\".\n\nA face covering serves a\"different purpose\"to a medical face mask, TAC said.\n\n\"A face covering principally acts to protect others by retarding the transmission of small droplets containing viral particles into the environment. Well-fitted medical face masks serve to protect the wearer from infection and others from transmission if the wearer is infectious.\n\n\"Face coverings are likely to benefit others, as much as or more than they do for the wearer.\"\n\nBut it added that scientific evidence\"was not robust\".\n\nPlaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he was\"surprised that the Welsh Government took so long to respond to the overwhelming international evidence that face coverings can be a very useful weapon in the war against coronavirus\".\n\n\"But better late than never,\"he said.\n\nThe Welsh Government has declined to make the advice mandatory, in part because of concerns it could prove to be discriminatory to people from more deprived areas, the deaf and those with autism.\n\nBut Peter Hughes, the Wales Regional Secretary for the Unite union, criticised the Welsh Government for not doing so.\n\n\"To be honest I am a bit disappointed in the Welsh Government for this because it sends a very different message to what they're doing in England,\"he said.\n\nHe said the difference over the border sends a\"very mixed message\", adding:\"We don't want a bus driver to be a statistic of this terrible disease.\"\n\n'Part of the whole approach'\n\nAn expert who helped lead Hong Kong's investigation into Sars said wearing masks was a sensible way of controlling the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nProf Sian Griffiths told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast:\"In Hong Kong people wear masks to stop them spreading infection if they have it themselves - independent of whether it's coronavirus. \n\n\"If you have an upper respiratory tract virus people will wear masks and so it's actually just part of social hygiene.\n\n\"We need to take the hygiene messages seriously still, the hand washing shouldn't go away, but masks are part of that whole approach.\"\nTL;DR: People in Wales are being asked to wear three-layer face coverings on public transport and other situations where social distancing is not possible.\n\nArticle: The Woman in Black: Angels of Death takes place 40 years on from the spooky events of the first movie.\n\nThat one, starring Daniel Radcliffe, has made \u00a375m worldwide so far.\n\nHammer will produce the movie, adapted from a story by author Susan Hill which follows a couple encountering the haunted Eel Marsh House.\n\nThe Woman in Black, which was directed by James Watkins and adapted by Kick-Ass screenwriter Jane Goldman, sat at the number one spot at the UK box office for three weeks.\n\nThe new film will be adapted by Jon Crocker.\n\nHammer Films president Simon Oakes said:\"We are proud and honoured to be working with Susan again on The Woman in Black: Angels Of Death, a wonderful new tale every bit as atmospheric and terrifying as its predecessor.\"\n\nHammer also recently announced two more films going into production this year - The Quiet Ones and Gaslight, both of which will shoot in the UK.\nTL;DR: The Woman In Black is to get a sequel, after the first instalment became the highest-grossing British horror film of the past 20 years.\n\nArticle: Under proposed new rules, the UK would be required to run a budget surplus when the economy is growing.\n\nHe is expected to revive a committee that last met more than 150 years ago to help balance the nation's books.\n\nWilliam Pitt the Younger convened the Committee of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt to repair the UK's finances after the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMr Osborne will also take inspiration from other countries' more recent fiscal triumphs - the chancellor will say he is following the lead of Canada and Sweden in the late 1990s.  \n\nTheir balanced budget rules helped them to withstand the financial crisis, he will say.\n\nBut economic watchers are waiting to hear how - and if - the plan will work. \n\n'Laudable aim'\n\nSome experts have some misgivings about how the potential new rules would work.\n\nJohn Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said:\"While running a budget surplus is a laudable aim, economic history shows that the national interest sometimes requires fiscal flexibility. \n\n\"It is impossible to predict global economic conditions with any certainty, so no government should put itself into a fiscal straitjacket that limits its scope to respond. \n\n\"Any move to constrain future spending should explicitly exclude infrastructure, which is an investment rather than just a cost. \n\n\"Roads, railways, energy grids and broadband drive productivity and job creation - and it is time for government's contributions to national infrastructure to be removed from the debate on the deficit and the national debt. \n\n\"Far too often, Britain's infrastructure needs have been sacrificed to short-term spending considerations. This must stop.\"\n\n'Constraint'\n\nChris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, says governments should be trusted to manage public finances, with the ability to run a deficit if necessary to stimulate the economy.\n\n\"It's almost unnecessarily putting a constraint on policy making,\"he says.\n\nMr Williamson also asks what the implications would be if the government broke the deficit rule.\n\n\"Is it more of a PR stunt than a piece of policy making?\"he asks. \n\nAnother economist asks how the new constraints will actually be implemented.\n\n\"You can put down as many rules as you want, but the responsibility lies with policymakers to actually deliver it,\"says Ross Walker, senior UK economist at RBS.\n\nHe points out that he UK has one of the largest structural deficits in the developed world.\n\nHowever, David Gauke, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said the proposed new measures would not limit the government's ability to stimulate growth.\n\n\"The idea that there is a contradiction between taking a fiscally conservative approach and getting to grips with public finances and growing the economy is simply not true.\n\n\"In 2014 we were the fastest growing major economy in the western world whilst pursuing measures to reduce our deficit.\"\nTL;DR: George Osborne is expected to look to the past to achieve a novelty in the modern-day UK - an economic surplus.\n\nArticle: Janet Hart told BBC Scotland that Alexander Gartshore, who died in 2006, attacked her two years after her 11-year-old sister vanished in Coatbridge.\n\nShe said police spoke to her after the incident, but nothing more was done.\n\nMs Hart now lives in Australia, and has come to Scotland to mark the 60th anniversary since Moira disappeared.\n\nShe told BBC Scotland she was out during her lunch hour from school when a man called her over to his car.\n\n\"He had the bonnet up at the side,\"she said.\n\n\"He told me to hold his dipstick, and under he went and up - groping me.\n\n\"I dropped the dipstick and ran.\"\n\nShe said she turned back to note down his registration plate.\n\nTwo policewomen came to the school and spoke to Ms Hart, but she said\"nothing more was heard\".\n\n\"Wouldn't you think something would have happened then?\"she said.\n\nAfterwards, the school rector spoke to pupils and advised them to go around the community in pairs, she said.\n\n\"That was Alexander Gartshore, I identified him, I remembered him so clearly,\"she said.\n\n\"Luckily I was in an area I could get away - it was broad daylight.\n\n\"Unfortunately Moira was trapped on his bus.\"\n\nThe last time Moira was seen, she was boarding a local Baxter's bus.

\u00a33.7bn) through disinvestment in state-owned companies; even as he provided minor incentives to individual tax payers and small retail investors.\n\nSpending on conspicuous consumption, such as cars, gold and jewelry, and tobacco products, will also be more heavily taxed.\n\nMr Mukherjee estimated that all these measures would increase revenue by more than 400bn rupees next year.\n\nDefence spending spree\n\nThe focus to reduce expenditure fell on the growing subsidies for food, fertilizers and fuel.\n\nPost-budget, in an interview to an Indian news channel, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the government was willing to\"bite the bullet\"to reduce subsidies from 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) today to 2% next year and further to 1.7% within three years.\n\nMr Mukherjee said pilot projects would be initiated this year to ensure subsidies are delivered to their intended targets efficiently and without being diverted by corruption.\n\nAs part of this, India's ongoing project to include the entire population in a biometric identity database would be fully rolled out by December 2012, he said.\n\nDespite such moves, the fiscal deficit is expected to rise to 5.9% of GDP in 2011-12, from the projected 4.6%; however, it would be reduced to 5.1% in 2012-13, the finance minister projected.\n\nGiven the government's consistent emphasis on\"inclusive\"growth, the expenditure on welfare schemes has gone up, and new schemes have been announced in this budget.\n\nAdditional incentives come in the form of lower interest rates for farmers, more credit to be allocated to farmers and a promise to implement the food security bill.\n\nAdditional money was announced for defence too, with spending to jump by 17% to 1.93tn rupees in the coming year.\n\nMr Mukherjee said that while more than 40% of it would be spent on capital investment, there would be no dearth of funds if the armed forces required more money.\n\nIndia has been on a buying spree for defence equipment recently.\n\nIt signed a deal worth up to 1tn rupees with France's Dassault Rafale to procure 18 medium multi-role combat aircraft in flyaway condition with the option to build another 108 under licence by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.\n\nMr Mukherjee paid lip service to criticisms that the government is unable to push through economic reforms because of politcial pressure from its coalition allies.\n\nHe announced that several pending economic bills would be introduced in parliament, the direct tax code and a goods and services tax (GST) would be finalised soon and foreign direct investment might be allowed in retail and aviation.\n\nIt was a budget that tried to please everyone and was determined to balance the expenditure, revenue and deficit numbers.\n\nIt reminded many of the budgets of the 1980s; it did not seem like one for the 21st Century.\n\nAlam Srinivas is a business analyst who has covered the government budget for more than two decades.\nTL;DR: Confidence about the economy's performance in the near future, good intentions, higher taxation and lack of concrete steps summarise India's 2012-23 budget.\n\nArticle: Dhneep\"Neepy\"Bains went to her doctor in Colchester, Essex, more than 10 times for pain in her foot and leg and was initially told to take painkillers.\n\nShe was eventually diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer when her mum demanded an MRI scan.

Whatever this is we will tackle this together. You're not on your own'.\n\n\"We were then told she had cancer, and that's when everything came crashing down.\"\n\nMs Waltho-Brar said she wanted young people and healthcare professionals to familiarise themselves better with the symptoms of cancer.\n\n\"If you know something is wrong, you have to demand to be seen, to kick down doors.\n\n\"I knew I had to do something - at first for my daughter's sake, and now for others - this cannot happen.\"\n\nNeepy was diagnosed with stage 4 Ewing Sarcoma of the pelvis, resulting in 26 rounds of chemotherapy starting in May 2018 and weeks of radiotherapy.\n\nShe had further treatment when a growth was detected in her lung in January 2019, and Neepy was advised the cancer was not shrinking and she should live her life to the fullest.\n\n\"She didn't even have the chance to freeze her eggs before treatment, there just wasn't the time and that was devastating,\"said Ms Walthro-Brar. \n\n\"The prognosis could have been different, if it had been detected at stage 1 they could've removed the tumour and she could've lived another 20 years.\"\n\n'Difference between life and death'\n\nDr Louise Soanes, director of services at Teenage Cancer Trust which supported Neepy, said:\"Cancer is thankfully rare in teenagers and young adults, accounting for just 1% of all cancer diagnoses. \n\n\"However, because cancer is less common in this age group, they often have to visit their doctor numerous times before they get a [correct] diagnosis. \n\n\"Symptoms of cancer can be wide-ranging - from persistent pain and lumps and bumps to unexplained bruising - and young people can see their doctor with one, or several signs.  \n\n\"Diagnosing cancer early can have a significant impact on a young person's life.

He was being held by Islamic State militants who have already killed two US captives. \n\nThe latest video also includes a threat to kill a second British hostage.\n\nThe PM vowed to do everything possible to find the killers. Mr Haines's family said he would be\"missed terribly\".\n\nBorn in Holderness, East Yorkshire, Mr Haines went to school in Perth and had been living in Croatia with his second wife, who is Croatian, and their four-year-old daughter. His parents live in Ayr.\n\n'Despicable and appalling'\n\nIn a statement released by the Foreign Office, Mike Haines said his brother, a father of two,\"was and is loved by all his family\".\n\n\"David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,\"he said.\n\nMr Cameron, who chaired an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Sunday morning, said the murder of an innocent aid worker was\"despicable and appalling\".\n\n\"It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,\"the prime minister added.\n\n'Grief and resolve'\n\nThe Foreign Office is working to verify the video, which was released on Saturday night. It begins with a clip of Mr Cameron and then features a man who appears to be Mr Haines dressed in orange overalls, kneeling in front of a masked man holding a knife.\n\nThe victim says:\"My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution.\"\n\nHe says Mr Cameron had entered into a coalition with the US against the Islamic State\"just as your predecessor Tony Blair did\".\n\n\"Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our parliament's selfish decisions,\"he said.\n\nThe militant, who appears to have a British accent, is then recorded as saying:\"This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State.\"\n\nIslamic State is now in control of large parts of northern Iraq and Syria, and the CIA estimates that the group could have as many as 30,000 fighters in the region.\n\nThe UK has donated heavy machine guns and ammunition to authorities in Iraq to help fight IS militants, the Ministry of Defence has previously said.\n\nKurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have been involved in heavy fighting with IS.\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nMr Haines's death has been condemned by international political leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, French President Francois Hollande, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.\n\nUS President Barack Obama said the US would work with the UK and other countries to\"bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice\".\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government\"will not rest\"until Mr Haines's killers\"face justice\".\n\nMr Alex Salmond said a resilience meeting - the Scottish government's version of the UK's Cobra security meeting - would be held on Sunday morning to discuss issues such as the privacy of Mr Haines's family.\n\nThe leader of the Better Together campaign in Scotland, Alistair Darling, said Mr Haines's death\"inexcusable, a barbaric act\"that would\"strengthen the resolve of the international community\". \n\nJustice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would like to see the militant in the video\"face justice in a British court - he's a British citizen and has been boasting of that\".\n\nAnalysis: Jim Muir, BBC News\n\nThe beheadings of David Haines, and the two American journalists before him, are believed to have been filmed in the desert near Raqqa, a provincial capital in north-east Syria which has become the unofficial capital of the self-styled Islamic State. \n\nFar from being just a shadowy terror group, IS controls a large swathe of territory in the north and east of Syria, linked since June to almost all the mainly Sunni parts of Iraq. \n\nIt controls a population of around 5 or 6 million people, including Iraq's second city, Mosul. \n\nIn northern Iraq, the Kurds, helped by US air strikes, are slowly regaining the ground they lost to IS when it suddenly turned on them last month. \n\nThat's the template the Americans and their allies want to apply to other parts of Iraq, and Syria, but the situation in both countries is complicated by the absence of clear-cut, cohesive local forces on the ground to work with. \n\nElsewhere, religious leaders have also reacted to the killing, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who posted a call on Twitter for prayers for the family of Mr Haines, who was\"evilly killed\".\n\nShuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain said:\"These extremists wish to draw attention and recruits to their cause by sowing division and fear between people here in Britain. Let us deny them that luxury.\"\n\n'Criminals and villains'\n\nColonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said it was vital that Britain took some\"serious action\"against IS.\n\n\"The key issue here is that we cannot rule out the use of large-scale ground forces. I don't mean the kind of thing that's happening now. I mean large-scale intervention forces,\"he told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\nFailure to do so would mean Britain would\"just accept the fact that the Islamic State will continue to expand, continue to decapitate our citizens, continue to pose a threat to our country and countries in the region\".\n\nBut former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge said Britain\"must be sober about this, and understand our national interests and equate what we do with those interests\".\n\nHe said IS's objective now is\"to hold what it's got, and there's no better way of doing that than recruiting to it the millions of people in the area who'd be quite happy to fight yet another Western intervention in the area\".\n\nPaul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University, said the UK's natural reaction would be to\"go in hard\"against IS, but that this presented a problem, because the extremists wanted to be attacked so as to\"present itself as fighting the far enemy\".\n\nMr Rogers also said the\"war\"in the region was\"at a much higher level than we suppose\", with more than 2,000 sorties by the US in the last few weeks.  \n\nThe West was now moving into\"what is essentially a third Iraq war\"and that this time it would extend into Syria, he said.\n\nMr Haines was taken hostage in the village of Atmeh, in the Idlib province of Syria, in March 2013.\n\nHe had been helping French agency Acted deliver humanitarian aid, having previously helped local people in Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe release of the video came hours after his family made a direct appeal to IS to contact them.\n\nIS - also known as Isis or Isil - has seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and declared a new caliphate - or Islamic state.\n\nMilitants from the extremist group have killed two US hostages in recent weeks, posting video evidence on the internet.\n\nThey threatened to kill Mr Haines during a video posted online showing the killing of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month.\n\nThe extremist group also killed fellow US journalist James Foley last month.\nTL;DR: The murder of British hostage David Haines was an \"act of pure evil\", David Cameron has said after the release of a video of his beheading.\n\nArticle: Her podcast, You, Me and the Big C, which she co-presented with Deborah James and Lauren Mahon, was, and still is, hugely popular. \n\nThe day before she died, her husband, Steve, tweeted that they had reached the top of the podcast chart. \n\nRefreshing\n\nAlison Carter, a retail manager in London, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and has written a blog about her own cancer journey. \n\nShe said she looked forward to every podcast and felt she could relate to so much of what Rachael had said.\n\n\"It felt like my generation was talking to me and that's been really powerful,\"she said.\n\n\"So much of the discussions about cancer is around old people.

And he writes business advice books.\n\nAnd if that weren't all more than enough, Mr Johnson, 51, recently launched a new think tank, the Centre for Entrepreneurs, which aims to promote\"the role of entrepreneurs in creating economic growth and social well-being\".\n\nMr Johnson says:\"Boredom is a great enemy in my life. I like to avoid getting bored.\n\n\"I have a restless personality, like other entrepreneurs, that keeps me going. Business is what I do, and I believe that all people need work of a sort, they need to be proactive.\"\n\n'The perfect business'\n\nTo go back in time, Mr Johnson made his first fortune - and his reputation as a shrewd businessman - in the world of pizza.\n\nIt was 1993, and Mr Johnson was just 30 years old. He and Hugh Osmond, his business partner at the time, decided to take a share in a small London-based restaurant chain called Pizza Express.\n\nWith the help of their overdrafts and savings, the two budding young entrepreneurs managed to cobble together the funds, and persuade Pizza Express's founder that they were the right men to lead the company's expansion.\n\nPizza Express had just 12 branches at the time, but within six years this had increased to more than 250 across the UK. At the same time, its share price rose from 40p to more than \u00a39.\n\nMr Johnson has since described Pizza Express as the\"perfect business\"because of pizza's enduring popularity, and its high profit margins.\n\nBut keen for a fresh challenge, Mr Johnson sold up in 1999. He then went on to own famous London restaurants such as The Ivy and Le Caprice, while launching the Strada Italian restaurant chain, which were sold in 2005 for a total of more than \u00a390m.\n\nMr Johnson subsequently grew the Giraffe restaurant chain, which was sold this year to supermarket group Tesco for \u00a350m. \n\nHe says that for someone with wide-ranging restaurant industry experience it is not too difficult to establish a winning formula.\n\n\"There are a host of things you are looking for,\"he says.\"Try to find great partners and managers who you want to work with, people who are confident, knowledgeable and motivated.\n\n\"And find projects that are established, but not yet scaled up. I like to think that what I bring to the party is the capital, knowledge and connections that allow the business to expand significantly.\"\n\nAt the actual restaurant level, he says:\"The properties are very important, the branch management is very important, and of course the menu and good service.\"\n\n'Tough lessons'\n\nFor all Mr Johnson's success in business, which also includes six years as chairman of UK broadcaster Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, it all could have turned out very differently. When he first went to Oxford University as an 18-year-old, he was meant to go on to become a doctor.\n\nAll that changed, however, when he and a friend started to run a nightclub evening.\n\n\"We had the bright idea to charge our friends entry, and that was it for me. I knew there and then that this was what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to ultimately run my own companies.\"\n\nMr Johnson decided against continuing his medical degree and instead graduated in physiological sciences.\n\nHe then worked as a stockbroker for a number of years before ultimately taking the plunge into the world of entrepreneurship at the age of 27.\n\nNow in his early 50s, Mr Johnson is keen to pass on his knowledge to young entrepreneurs just starting out in their business life.\n\nRecently addressing the launch of Global Entrepreneurship Week, which in the UK is organised by the Prince of Wales's start-up support charity Youth Business International, Mr Johnson was keen to stress the importance of coping with failure.\n\nIll-fated purchase\n\nHighlighting two of his own, he said\"everything went wrong\"when he tried to open a branch of Belgo, the mussels and frites restaurant, in New York.\n\n\"The US partner went bust, we chose the wrong location, and we neglected to use unionised labour, which you have to do in the US...

World Bank executive Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had a lead of 0.28 percentage points over Keiko Fujimori.\n\nElection officials said the votes of Peruvians living abroad still had to be processed and that it could take a few more days to declare a winner. \n\nBefore the election, polls had suggested Ms Fujimori would win. \n\nThe latest tally of votes is available at the Peruvian electoral commission  (ONPE) website.\n\n'Risk to democracy'\n\nAnalysts said corruption scandals in Ms Fujimori's Popular Force Party may have dented her support since April, when she comfortably won the first round of voting.\n\nShe is the daughter of Peru's former President, Alberto Fujimori, who is in jail for crimes against humanity.\n\nShadow of jailed ex-president cast over Peru polls\n\nKeiko Fujimori\n\nIn the run-up to the second round, Mr Kuczynski portrayed Ms Fujimori as a\"risk to democracy\", reminding voters of her father's crimes and authoritarian style of government.\n\nBut many Peruvians, who credit her father with defeating the Shining Path rebel movement, were drawn to her promise of being tough on crime.\n\nMr Kuczynski, who is an ex-Wall Street financier, said he would use his international financial experience to promote economic growth.\n\nHe has the support of prominent figures such as Nobel-Prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and left-wing candidate Veronika

in council tax and said public sector pay would be frozen for the next year.\n\nThe opposition at Holyrood accused Mr Swinney of moving the effect of UK-wide cuts to Scotland's local authorities.\n\nThe plans included a boost to government-backed capital investment, intended to support economic recovery.\n\nMore than \u00a3750m will be transferred from resource expenditure into the capital investment programme.\n\nMr Swinney told MSPs:\"This spending review contains tough choices because of the cuts from Westminster that go too far, too fast.\n\n\"We have had to restrict pay costs, reluctantly implement pensions increases on public sector staff, and maximise the income gained from asset sales.\"\n\nRetailer tax\n\nMr Swinney stood by the Scottish government's commitment to freeze council tax levels for five years, and said he would provide funding to cover the freeze.\n\nPart of the additional revenue being raised by the Scottish government will come from a levy on major retailers supplying alcohol and tobacco products.\n\nDuring the last parliament, a proposal to introduce a wider measure which came to be known as the\"Tesco tax\"was voted down by opposition MSPs.\n\nCBI Scotland's director, Iain McMillan, said he was worried about the plan.\n\nHe added:\"The re-emergence of the retail levy was absent from the SNP manifesto and we consider its re-appearance a fundamental breach of the commitment to poundage rate parity.\"\n\nLabour's finance spokesman, Richard Baker, accused the SNP of passing on the pain to local authorities.\n\nHe said education and social work budgets would be particularly badly hit.\n\n\"The Scottish government has passed the buck for the decisions they have made today,\"he said.\n\n\"There has been no rabbit out of the hat from Mr Swinney and there is a great deal of pain for key parts of our economy and many people in our society in this budget.\"\n\nEconomic stability\n\nThe Conservatives' finance spokesman Gavin Brown accused the SNP of not putting the economy at the heart of its budget.\n\nHe said:\"This government ought to be judged by what it does as opposed to just what it says.\n\n\"They have said the economy is the most important thing but the rhetoric and the reality do not match together.\"\n\nThe leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Willie Rennie, said Mr Swinney needed to concede that the UK government was contributing to the stability in the Scottish economy.\n\n\"This is a partnership between two governments,\"he said.\n\n\"To present it in the way he does in black and white terms, that the UK is only responsible for bad things and Scotland is only responsible for good things, I think demeans him and it demeans his office.\"\n\nThere has been mixed reaction from businesses to the measures outlined by Mr Swinney.\n\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce welcomed the emphasis on capital spending, but was unhappy about the levy on alcohol and tobacco retailers.\n\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium said the levy was\"illogical and discriminatory\", and ignored other parts of the supply chain. \n\nMSPs are expected to vote on the spending proposals for

Through this false site, details of about 500,000 customers were harvested by the attackers, the ICO said.\n\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said:\"People's personal data is just that - personal. When an organisation fails to protect it from loss, damage or theft, it is more than an inconvenience.\n\n\"That's why the law is clear - when you are entrusted with personal data, you must look after it. Those that don't will face scrutiny from my office to check they have taken appropriate steps to protect fundamental privacy rights.\"\n\nThe incident was first disclosed on 6 September 2018 and BA had initially said approximately 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details.\n\nWhat information was stolen?\n\nThe ICO said the incident was believed to have begun in June 2018.\n\nThe watchdog said a variety of information was\"compromised\"by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.\n\nBA initially said information involved included names, email addresses, credit card information such as credit card numbers, expiry dates and the three-digit CVV code found on the back of credit cards.\n\nThe watchdog said BA had co-operated with its investigation and made improvements to its security arrangements.\n\nWhat are the new rules?\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force last year and was the biggest shake-up to data privacy in 20 years.\n\nThe penalty imposed on BA is the first one to be made public since those rules were introduced, which make it mandatory to report data security breaches to the information commissioner.\n\nIt also increased the maximum penalty to 4% of turnover. The BA penalty amounts to 1.5% of its worldwide turnover in 2017, less than the possible maximum.\n\nUntil now, the biggest penalty was \u00a3500,000, imposed on Facebook for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  That was the maximum allowed under the old data protection rules that applied before GDPR.\n\n'Sending a shiver down the spine'\n\nI imagine that many people's first reaction to the \u00a3183m fine that the Information Commissioner plans to levy on British Airways will have mirrored mine - surely the decimal point must be in the wrong place? \n\nAfter all the proposed penalty is roughly 367 times as high as the previous record fine, the \u00a3500,000 imposed on Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that the law has changed between the two incidents, with the arrival of a new law mirroring Europe's GDPR. This allows fines of up to 4% of annual turnover. \n\nNow you might have expected the data regulator to be somewhat cautious at first in wielding this powerful new weapon but today's news will send a shiver down the spine of anyone responsible for cybersecurity at a major corporation. \n\nThe message is clear - if you don't treat your customers' data with the utmost care expect severe punishment when things go wrong. \n\nBritish Airways certainly appears to be stunned. But then again it could have been worse: the full 4% of turnover would have meant a fine approaching \u00a3500m.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBA has 28 days to appeal. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said British Airways would be making representations to the ICO.\n\n\"We intend to take all appropriate steps to defend the airline's position vigorously, including making any necessary appeals,\"he said.\n\nAlex Cruz, British Airways' chairman and chief executive, said the airline was\"surprised and disappointed\"in the ICO's initial finding.\n\n\"British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers' data. We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft.\n\n\"We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this event caused.\"\n\nFraudster attempted to shop at Harrods\n\nDavid Champion believes that the BA data breach probably led to his credit card being used fraudulently.\n\nHe says he was notified that his card had been used in an attempt to buy items at Harrods by phone while he was in Malaysia.\n\n\"BA are claiming there were no fraudulent transactions from the leak. My card details, I don't think, weren't exposed anywhere else,\"he told the BBC.\n\nThe transaction was rejected and Mr Champion was not left out of pocket.\n\n\"BA contacted me in August/September about the breach, that addresses and emails were leaked. Later they said credit card details were too,\"he added.\n\nHe was worried as he knew he had used BA's site twice, and said that it was right that BA was being penalised for the incident.\n\nWhere does the money go?\n\nThe penalty is divided up between the other European data authorities, while the money that comes to the ICO goes directly to the Treasury.\n\nIt is up to individuals to claim money from BA, which provided no information on whether any compensation had been paid.\n\nUnder the regulations, authorities in the EU whose residents have been affected will also have the chance to comment on the ICO's findings.\nTL;DR: British Airways is facing a record fine of \u00a3183m for last year's breach of its security systems.\n\nArticle: They were part of a group of Taiwanese nationals arrested in Malaysia and deported to Taiwan.\n\nChina said it wanted to prosecute them, but Taiwanese officials said there was insufficient evidence.\n\nTaiwan has protested after Kenya deported to China 45 Taiwanese nationals accused of the same crime.\n\nWhat's behind the China-Taiwan divide?\n\nThe latest case began in Malaysia, which last month arrested 119 people suspected of being involved in a number of telephone scams. Just over half the suspects were from China, and more than 50 were from Taiwan.\n\nChina's Xinhua state news agency said the fraudsters pretended to be law enforcement officers in order to extort money from their victims, many of them from mainland China. \n\nChina wanted them returned, saying its people had been defrauded. Taiwan said they were its citizens and so should be sent home.\n\nA batch of 20 Taiwanese suspects were eventually sent to Taiwan - and immediately released.\n\nThe Taiwanese authorities said there was not enough evidence to prosecute, although they said they had asked China to provide information.\n\nBeijing reacted angrily.\n\n\"By releasing the suspects, [the] Taiwan authorities disregarded many victims' interests and harmed them a second time,\" a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office - China's Taiwan policy body - was quoted by Xinhua as saying.\n\nHe said Taiwan should seriously pursue wrongdoers.\n\nAbout 30 Taiwanese suspects involved in this case are still in Malaysia awaiting a decision on where they should be deported to.\n\nOne-China policy\n\nChinese authorities have said they have jurisdiction over the group of Taiwanese who were deported from Kenya.\n\nState council and security officials said the Taiwanese were part of a telecoms fraud ring who cost mainland victims billions of yuan.\n\nTaiwan said they were forced on board a plane by Kenyan police wielding rifles and tear gas.\n\nIt said the deportation amounted to\"extrajudicial abduction\"and called for the group's release.\n\nBut China has said some of these suspects have already admitted what they have done.\n\nChina also praised Kenya for supporting its\"one-China policy\".\n\nBeijing views Taiwan - self-ruling since 1950 - as a breakaway region that must be reunited with the mainland.\n\nIt insists that other countries cannot recognise both China and Taiwan, with the result that Taiwan has formal diplomatic ties with only a few countries.

Adjusting for this, the ONS said underlying wage growth was\"likely to be under 3%\".\n\nThe ONS said 1.74 million people were unemployed in the October to December period, up 454,000 from the same quarter in 2019.\n\nFurlough uncertainty\n\n\"Our survey shows that the unemployment rate has had the biggest annual rise since the financial crisis,\"said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics.\n\n\"However, the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for work has stabilised after rising sharply at the start of the pandemic, with many people who lost their jobs early on having now started looking for work.\"\n\nDespite this, Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme that the true underlying picture was not yet clear due to the high number of people still on furlough. \n\nHe said figures from early February suggested that about six million people were currently furloughed, adding:\"There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what will happen to them when that scheme ends.\"\n\nThe Bank of England is forecasting that the unemployment rate will rise sharply, peaking at an estimated 7.8% later in the year.\n\n'I wasn't going anywhere'\n\nKeighlie Holt is a 20 year-old hairdresser from Blackpool, which has the highest youth unemployment in the UK.

No, I wasn't going anywhere.\"\n\nWhy has pay risen?\n\nToday's labour market figures show that pay was up by an average of nearly 5% compared with a year ago - a much bigger pay rise than has been typical for most of the past decade. \n\nIf you're an employee you may not recognise that figure as anywhere near your own pay rise; a big part of it is because it is an average figure. \n\nIf you remove nearly 730,000 workers from employers' payrolls, many of whom have been in low-paid occupations such as accommodation and food services - where pay rises have been modest or non-existent - then it flatters the average. \n\nHowever, even allowing for those\"compositional\"effects, the Office for National Statistics estimates that there was still pay growth of 3% overall - far more than inflation at 0.7%.\n\nAnd in some sectors it was better than that: according to the ONS, pay in health and social work rose by an average of 6.2% - some modest compensation, perhaps, for the risks those workers have been taking. \n\nThe Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing for next week's Budget, which is expected to set out further plans to help the labour market.\n\n\"I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy,\"Mr Sunak said.\n\n\"At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery.\"\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, claimed some businesses were\"throwing in the towel\"because the government was taking too long to confirm what business support would be available to them over the next six months.\n\nMs Dodds criticised the government for announcing its roadmap to ending lockdown\"without the clarity of business support\".

Mrs Clinton's email system existed in a grey area of the law - and one that has been changed several times since she left office.\n\nWhy the controversy?\n\nIt's a big deal because Mrs Clinton is asking the US public to trust that she is complying with both the\"letter and the spirit of the rules\". Critics on the left and the right are concerned that she made her communications on sensitive national security issues more susceptible to hackers and foreign intelligence services.\nTL;DR: Hackers apparently based in Russia sent at least five emails containing malware to the private email account used by Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state, newly released emails show.\n\nArticle: By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent\n\nG4S says it has pulled out of the bidding to focus on running prisons.  \n\nThe company was heavily criticised after undercover filming at the facility near Gatwick Airport captured detainees being mistreated by staff. \n\nThe decision means G4S will no longer have any involvement in the immigration and asylum sector.\n\nIn August, the company stopped operating accommodation for asylum seekers in the Midlands, north-east England and Northern Ireland. \n\nG4S began running Brook House when it opened in 2009 but was embroiled in controversy in 2017 after the BBC's Panorama programme broadcast video, secretly taken by a staff member, of detainees being verbally and physically abused. \n\nAfter the programme was shown, various investigations were carried out and 15 of the 21 staff allegedly involved later resigned or were sacked.\n\nThe contract to run the 448-bed facility was due to end in 2018 but was temporarily extended until May 2020. \n\nThe Home Office began a tendering process but after initial discussions, G4S has decided not to continue beyond that date. \n\n\"G4S will not seek to renew the contract to run Gatwick's immigration removal centres, Brook House and Tinsley House,\"the company said in a statement. \n\n\"This will allow us to give greater focus to our custody and rehabilitation business, where we operate four of the highest-rated prisons in England and Wales.\"\n\nG4S is keen to acquire further prison contracts as the government seeks to provide 10,000 new places. \n\n'Significant improvements'\n\nThere's also been concern among managers that its bid to renew the Brook House contract might fail because of damaging publicity surrounding it.\n\nFurther revelations about alleged abuse are likely to emerge during an independent inquiry which is expected to start next year. \n\nSerco is believed to be a front-runner for the contract. The results of the bidding process are due to be announced in January.  \n\nHowever, the latest inspection report on Brook House suggests there have been significant improvements. \n\nPeter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said:\"We found no evidence that the abusive culture shown by the Panorama programme was present among the current staff group.\"\n\nHe went on:\"Most detainees were positive about the way they were treated.\"And he said the workforce had been\"determined\"to inject a\"respectful\"culture into the centre. \n\nNevertheless, the inspection report, the last under G4S's watch, said security was sometimes too stringent, detainees spent too long locked in their rooms and rates of self-harm had increased, with 40% saying they had felt suicidal at some point.\nTL;DR: Private firm G4S will no longer run Brook House immigration removal centre once the contract expires next year, BBC News has learned.\n\nArticle: He was briefly editor of Muscle and Fitness and Flex before becoming Governor of California in 2003 - but had to quit due to a conflict of interest.\n\nThe former body builder, who won Mr Universe at age 20, first appeared on the magazine's cover 45 years ago. \n\nIt is not yet known whether Schwarzenegger will write a column.\n\n\"Now my governorship is over, and I'm back in the movie business, I'm back promoting body building, sports and fitness,\"said Schwarzenegger.\n\nAs executive editor of both Muscle & Fitness and Flex, Schwarzenegger will have an influence in the editorial content of the magazines.\n\n\"Not everyone wants to be Mr. Olympia, but everyone wants to be strong and fit and fast,\"he added. \n\nIn his early 20s, Schwarzenegger won 5 Mr Universe titles and 7 Mr Olympia titles, before retiring to focus on his acting.\n\nHe went on to star in a number of cult films including Conan The Barbarian, The Terminator and its sequels, and Predator before entering politics as the 38th Governor of California - a post he held for two terms.\n\nSchwarzenegger recently returned to Hollywood to star in the action movie, The Last Stand, alongside Academy award-winner Forest Whitaker. \n\nHe has announced his participation in a number of films including reprising his cult role as Conan.\nTL;DR: Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has returned to his role as the executive editor of two fitness magazines.\n\nArticle: In the US, many states restrict the voting rights of people convicted of serious crimes upon their release.\n\nCritics say the policies are unfair and disproportionately affect black men. \n\nGovernor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said the move was meant to help undo the state's long history of trying to suppress the black vote.\n\nAlmost six million Americans cannot vote because they were convicted of a felony - typically a charge that carries a prison sentence of more than one year.\n\nActivists said Governor McAuliffe's order to restore voting rights is the largest of its kind in the US.\n\n\"Too often in both our distant and recent history, politicians have used their authority to restrict people's ability to participate in our democracy,\"Governor McAuliffe said.\n\nGovernor McAuliffe said he consulted with legal experts who determined that he had the authority to restore voting rights. However, his action is likely to be challenged by the Republican-led legislature. \n\nVirginia is considered a swing state in the coming presidential election and the move to expand voting rights of people convicted of felonies could benefit Democrats. \n\nGovernor McAuliffe is also a close ally of Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for president.\n\n\"The singular purpose of Terry McAuliffe's governorship is to elect Hillary Clinton president of the United States,\"Virginia House Speaker William J Howell said.\"This office has always been a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton's cabinet.\"\n\nUnder the order, those included will now also be able to run for public office, serve on a jury and become a notary public. To register to vote, they must not be in prison, on parole or on probation. \n\nLaws restricting voting rights of people convicted of felonies vary across the US. \n\nThree states - Florida, Iowa and Kentucky - bar people convicted of felonies from voting permanently. Meanwhile, two states - Vermont and Maine - have no restrictions on people convicted of felonies.\nTL;DR: The governor of the US state of Virginia has issued a sweeping executive order, restoring the right to vote to more than 200,000 convicts.\n\nArticle: It will take over the routes as the various rail franchises come up for renewal.\n\nThe new partnership between the Department for Transport and TfL says it aims to ensure there are more frequent trains and increased capacity.\n\nThe first rail franchise up for renewal is South West in 2017.\n\nMore news on this and other stories from London\n\nSouthern, Thameslink and Great Northern services could come under TfL's control by 2021.\n\nThe plan would mean more than 80% of stations would have a train at least every 15 minutes, up from 67%.\n\nServices running from London Bridge, Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Moorgate would all be transformed under the scheme.\n\nTransport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said:\"We are committed to making journeys better across London and the South East, and this new partnership represents a huge opportunity to transform travel by putting passengers where they should be -

creating about 20,000 jobs and generating 30,000 more in the supply chain and other parts of industry, giving an economic boost to south Wales and south-west England. \n\nThe electricity generated would be equivalent to three or four nuclear power stations and thousands of wind turbines, he said.\n\nThe UK government has been asked to comment.\nTL;DR: Plans for a \u00a325bn barrage in the Severn Estuary are \"dead in the water\" in the current Parliament, it has been said.\n\nArticle: The Made in Scotland scheme helps performers who are taking part in the world's biggest arts festival.\n\nSince 2009, \u00a31.6m has been given out to 56 theatre and dance productions.\n\nCulture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the funding is being expanded to support musicians, with an extra \u00a3100,000 available this year.\n\nShe announced the extra money as she met members of Edinburgh-based band The Blueswater whose performance at the festival last summer saw them collect a Mervyn Stutter Spirit of the Fringe award.\n\n'Demonstrate commitment'\n\nMs Hyslop said:\"The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the world's biggest arts festival, attracting visitors and artists from all over the globe to experience the cultural and creative talent it has to offer.\n\n\"It makes strong economic sense to ensure Scotland's own exceptional talent is at the centre of the Fringe and our artists are given opportunities to benefit from the global exposure the festival brings.\n\n\"Through Made in Scotland, part of the Edinburgh Festivals Expo Fund, the Scottish government continues to demonstrate its commitment to doing exactly that.\n\n\"Expanding the scope of the scheme to support musicians is a natural next step for Made in Scotland.

where the poor pay more for a range of services from heating their home to accessing credit - contributes to a vicious circle driving people ever deeper into debt and distress.\"\n\nSupport from banks\n\nShe added that the victims of financial exclusion were\"often the most vulnerable in society - the elderly, the poor or those living with physical disabilities or mental health issues\".\n\n\"Action must be taken to ensure the financial system in this country works for all. \n\nAll too often, disabled customers are being failed by banks who are not adjusting their communications and procedures to serve them properly, she said. \n\nThe committee had been told of banks contacting deaf people by phone and sending written PIN numbers to blind people instead of using Braille, she added.\n\nThe British Bankers Association said it was already working closely with the government, the regulator and consumer advocates on a number of the areas highlighted in the report.  \n\n\"We will consider the report's recommendations in detail and reflect on how they might be adopted by the industry going forward,\"it added.\n\nPolly Mackenzie, director of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said:\"For too long it's been assumed that when people with mental health problems get behind on bills, or struggle to stick to their budget, it's because they're lazy or incompetent. \n\n\"That's simply not true, and we are delighted to see the Lords committee recognise this and the need for banks to step up and offer support. \n\n\"It's time for banks to adapt their services to help support people when they're unwell.\"\nTL;DR: The banks and financial regulators should do more to tackle the vicious cycle of debt and overcharging, says a Lords committee.\n\nArticle: CCTV images of a teenage boy and girl have been released by Lancashire Constabulary after the worker was slapped across the face with a bream.\n\nThe incident took place on 4 February at a supermarket on Hyndburn Road, Accrington.\n\nLancashire Constabulary described the incident as\"completely unacceptable\".\n\nIn a statement, the police said the 52-year-old victim was working behind the fish counter when a young woman approached to ask about different fish.\n\n\"Without warning, the woman has picked up a large bream from the fish stall and slapped the worker across the face before running out of the store,\"said the statement from Lancashire Constabulary.\n\n\"The victim believes the incident was being filmed on a mobile phone by a man stood nearby who also ran from the scene when challenged.\"\n\nThe girl is described as being Irish and aged between 15 and 18 with\"blonde, shoulder-length untidy hair\".\n\nShe was wearing dark jeans and a blue coat with white cuffs, white down the front and a red collar with'I love PB' on the left breast pocket.\n\nThe boy is described as being about the same age, 5ft 8 tall, wearing a dark coat and dark grey trousers and boots.\n\nPC Graham Hartley said:\"This behaviour is completely unacceptable and I would appeal to anybody that witnessed this incident or recognises either the man or the woman pictured in the CCTV images to come forward.\"\nTL;DR: Police in England are searching for an Irish teenager who is said to have slapped a shop worker across the face with a large fish.\n\nArticle: The park authority is considering banning trail-bikes, quad bikes and 4x4s from unsurfaced roads at Long Causeway and Roych Clough.\n\nSome conservationists have concerns over erosion but motoring groups claim the move is unfair.\n\nThe consultation, which is focussed at the public and special interest groups, will run until 2 November.\n\nIn March, the park authority announced it would monitor 27 unsurfaced roads in the national park for use by 4x4s and off-road bikes.\n\nPopular destination\n\nThen in June it consulted statutory bodies on possible limits.\n\nThe proposals have already prompted protests from off-road groups who said it was unfair to ban all vehicles from public places.\n\nBut walkers claim the routes are suffering from overuse.\n\nThe park, which attracts more than 10 million visitors a year, has land located in Derbyshire, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire, Cheshire and South Yorkshire.\nTL;DR: Consultation over new restrictions for vehicles in part of the Peak District has begun.\n\nArticle: The Public Accounts Committee said the new Personal Independence Payment scheme had been\"rushed\"through, with a\"shocking\"impact on claimants.\n\n\"Many\"faced six-month delays, with terminally ill people waiting a month on average for the payment, it said. \n\nMinisters defended the system and said the MPs' figures were out of date.\n\nMinister for Disabled People Mike Penning said the new PIP system ensured\"support goes to those who need it most\".\n\nHe insisted the report was\"based on old statistics\", adding:\"I have introduced a faster process for people with terminal illnesses, with clearance times reducing to our target of 10 days. \n\n\"And a higher proportion of people are getting the highest rate of financial support for daily living under Personal Independence Payment than DLA.\"\n\nNew claims for the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) - which replaces the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) - began in April 2013. They are worth between \u00a321 and \u00a3134 a week.\n\nMost people applying for PIP have a face-to-face assessment to determine eligibility, which have been carried out by the private contractors Atos Healthcare and Capita Business Services.\n\n'Unacceptable' \n\nIn its report, the cross-party committee accused Atos of providing\"incorrect and potentially misleading\"information about its capabilities when bidding for the contract to conduct assessments for the government. \n\nThe company said it completely refuted the claim.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions began processing new claims for PIP in northern England in 2013, but had only made 360 decisions when the scheme was introduced nationwide in June.\n\nReassessment of the existing 1.7 million DLA claimants began in October, but was effectively paused after a backlog of some 780,000 claims built up. \n\nCommittee chairwoman and Labour MP Margaret Hodge said:\"The implementation of the Personal Independence Payment has been nothing short of a fiasco.\n\n\"The Department for Work and Pensions has let down some of the most vulnerable people in our society, many of whom have had to wait more than six months for their claims to be decided.\n\n\"The department's failure to pilot the scheme meant that the most basic assumptions, such as how long assessments would take and how many would require face-to-face consultations, had not been fully tested and proved to be wrong.\"\n\nShe continued that this had resulted in\"significant delays, a backlog of claims and unnecessary distress for claimants who have been unable to access the support they need to live, and in some cases work, independently\".\n\n\"The personal stories we heard were shocking,\"Mrs Hodge added.\n\nIn one case, a claimant required hospital intervention as a result of the stress caused by the delays.\n\nElsewhere, claimants had been forced to turn to food banks, loans and charitable donations to support the extra costs of living associated with their disability, the MPs said.\n\nThe committee also found the average waiting time for terminally ill people to receive a decision was 28 days - 180% longer than originally expected.\n\nClaimants had also endured an\"unacceptable\"standard of service, with assessors failing to turn up at centres or cancelling home visits at the last minute.\n\n'Old statistics'\n\n\"We are concerned that Atos appears to have included incorrect and potentially misleading information in its bid for the contract,\"Mrs Hodge went on.\n\n\"Atos stated in its tender document that it had'contractual agreements' in place with a national network of 56 NHS hospitals, 25 private hospitals and over 650 physiotherapy practices to provide assessments.\n\n\"This turned out not to be true.\"\n\nKate Green, Labour's shadow disability minister, said:\"This scathing criticism of the government's chaotic handling of PIP leaves serious questions about competence at Department for Work and Pensions. \n\n\"Thousands of disabled people are waiting months and months for essential help which means taxpayers are facing a huge bill to deal with the enormous backlog of Personal Independence Payment assessments.\"\n\nAn Atos Healthcare spokeswoman said:\"We completely refute any allegation of misinformation during the procurement process for Personal Independence Payment.\n\n\"The Department [DWP] made clear that they were not misinformed during the tender process, that at the point of'go live' they knew our capacity, our partners and the number of centres we would be using.\"\n\nShe added Atos had written to the committee to clarify its position and had\"invited the National Audit Office in to scrutinise our documentation\".\n\nIn a separate development, leaked government documents suggested Atos's PIP assessment backlog would not be cleared until March next year.\n\nAccording to the memos, Capita's backlog should be cleared by the end of November thanks to an additional \u00a327m the company has been paid by the government.\nTL;DR: Changes to benefits for sick and disabled people have led to a \"fiasco\", causing unnecessary distress to thousands of people, MPs have warned.\n\nArticle: By Dafydd EvansBBC News\n\nGwE consortium claimed changes to the grade threshold for English GCSE over the past year had created a\"lottery\", which led to 700 pupils missing out on a grade C pass. \n\nThe Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) exam board said they were confident in their awarding processes.\n\nThe regulator Qualifications Wales said WJEC had set the thresholds correctly.  \n\nGWE, the school improvement consortium for north Wales which represents head teachers, parents and councillors across the region, are calling on the Welsh Government to conduct a\"root and branch\"review. \n\nBetween summer 2017 and summer 2018, the score students needed to get a grade C in English GCSE was changed twice by WJEC. \n\nGwE claimed there was a significant change in the grade threshold, which meant students who took the exam early were treated differently to pupils in the same academic year who sat a different paper some months later. \n\nThey said 700 students across north Wales who got a D this summer could have got a C under the old criteria. \n\nRestoring trust\n\nCouncillor Gareth Thomas, chairman of GwE, said it was\"no exaggeration\"to say teachers had lost confidence in Qualifications Wales and the Welsh Joint Education Committee.\n\n\"Grades allocated to students over the past two years [had] more in common with the workings of a lottery than an examination board,\"he said.\n\n\"As a result, we are calling on the education secretary to investigate what has gone wrong and to ensure that Qualifications Wales as the regulator and WJEC as the examination board enter into meaningful discussions with key stakeholders as a first step towards restoring trust, confidence and transparency in the system.\"\n\nNeil Foley, head teacher of Prestatyn High School in Denbighshire, said some pupils had been unfairly marked down. \n\n\"Twenty six of our learners who should normally have achieved the C grade at GCSE failed to do so because of a 10% shift in the grade boundary, which we think is a great injustice.\"\n\nQualifications Wales said it had investigated the concerns when they were raised in September and had published a detailed report.\n\n\"After a thorough analysis of all the available evidence, we concluded that the grade boundaries were set correctly by WJEC and the national standard for GCSE English Language was consistent with last year,\"a spokesman said. \n\n\"We have had, and continue to have, ongoing dialogue with those who raised concerns.\"\n\nConsistent standards\n\nWJEC chief executive Roderic Gillespie said their primary aim was to ensure that candidates received the grades they deserved.\n\n\"As identified in the September 2018 report by Qualifications Wales, there was no evidence to support the claims that inconsistent standards were being applied across different examinations series,\"he added.\n\nThe Welsh Government has been asked

Wales faced a\"moment of truth\".\n\nPlaid wants to hold a referendum on Welsh independence if it wins May's Senedd election, although the power to do so lies at Westminster.\n\nMr Price added that his party had a post-Covid plan for the Welsh Government to tackle poverty.\n\nHe pointed to research which suggests fewer than half of care workers are paid the real living wage and more than 70,000 children in poverty do not qualify for free school meals.\n\nHe also cited a row over the furlough scheme between the Welsh and UK governments last autumn.\n\nThe UK government increased the wage subsidy when a lockdown was announced in England, mid-way through Wales's firebreak.\n\n\"Britain isn't working for us anymore - the Britain of my parents' generation, a brave and hopeful place, no longer exists,\"Mr Price told party activists.\n\n\"It has been erased and, in its place, we have the moral vacuum that is Westminster.\n\n\"The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the reality of modern Britain: a state defined by crushing poverty, ruled by a corrupt elite that gives contracts to its friends and denies furlough to its neighbours.\"\n\nSome recent opinion polls have suggested growing support for Welsh independence, but a clear majority remains opposed.\n\nThis will be Mr Price's first Senedd election since succeeding Leanne Wood as Plaid leader in 2018.\n\nIn this speech Adam Price tackles the argument that a moment of crisis is not the time to rock the boat. He calls for change on three fronts: governmental, social and constitutional.\n\nHe says the pandemic has brought Wales to a\"crossroads\", similar to the one the UK faced after the Second World War when the welfare state was established.\n\nThere are big spending promises and he rejects Labour criticism that they're unaffordable.\n\nHe attacks\"the conservatism of incumbency\"- a swipe at Conservative and Labour parties accustomed to holding office in Westminster and Cardiff Bay.\n\nOn the promise of a referendum on independence if Plaid wins the election, he says his party doesn't want it\"for its own sake\"but because\"Britain isn't working for us anymore\".\nTL;DR: Covid has exposed Britain's \"crushing poverty\" and \"corrupt elite\", according to the leader of Plaid Cymru.\n\nArticle: By Russell Hotten & Dan AscherBBC News\n\nBased on the exchange rate they got back in Kent, nurse Chloe estimates the total cost was around \u00a317.\"Given where we are I suppose it wasn't too excessive,\"she says.\"But I think it's the most expensive coffee I've ever bought.\"\n\nLunch, in the heart of Little Italy, was also an eye-opener.

But these are commercial rates. Tourists get a worse deal when exchanging currency.\n\nAnd yet, sterling's recent weakness has failed to dent visitor numbers.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, 1.8 million Britons visited the US in the five months to 31 May, 8.2% up on the period in 2018. The overwhelming majority were tourists and people visiting friends and family.\n\nFor 2018 as a whole, 4.7 million visited, up 4% on 2017. This, though, is below the peak year of 2015 when 4.9 million people visited.\n\nBut analysts doubt the numbers will hold up for the rest of 2019. Indeed, Adam Sacks, president of Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics, thinks the official data over-estimates the picture. \n\n'Defying gravity'\n\nFor a start, airline passenger growth from the UK to the US is up only 4%, he said.\"Right now, the market [from the UK] is defying gravity.\"\n\nIt helps that the US is a bucket-list attraction.\"That will always underpin tourism,\"he said.\n\nBut with sterling facing more headwinds because of Brexit, economic slowdown, and trade wars,\"I'm expecting inbound total traffic for the year to end about 2.5% up on 2018,\"he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the Strattons, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, have visited New York, but it's probably the most expensive. \n\nThey booked their hotel and flight last year, so think they got a better deal than now.\"And we're aware of all the free and discounted attractions that are available,\"says Annette. She advises visitors to do their research and seek these out to save money. \n\nBut, Richard says:\"Eating out for the four of us is very expensive - $100 a time at least. Sales taxes and tips mean costs soon increase. Even the hotel charges for wifi use.\"\n\nThey've split some breakfasts and drinks between them to help cut costs.

Mum, though, thinks it could be even more expensive than New York.\n\nChris Heywood, an executive at New York's tourist board, NYC & Company, says it would take a sustained and prolonged sterling depression to hit hard the number of UK visitors to his city.\n\nBritons make up the single biggest group of overseas visitors, with 1.26 million seeing the sites in 2018. The number has grown steadily since 2012, when one million visited.\n\n\"People are planning their visits better. More come in the first three months of the year, when hotel rates drop,\"he said.

Johanna, had just bought her son, Cougar, a meal at McDonald's, which she said would have been almost half the price at home in Washington state.\n\nNevertheless, prices overall were lower than she had budgeted for, although she had prepared for the worst and saved money by staying with her sister.\n\nBob and Priya were leaving Hamley's with their two daughters, who had bought two teddy bears. The couple were used to New York prices so London\"wasn't a shocker\", Bob said.\n\nThe EU referendum in June 2016 knocked the value of the pound, making things cheaper for US tourists. Before the vote, $1 was worth around 68 pence. It's now worth about 80p.\n\nAnd that spurred a big increase in the number of people crossing the Atlantic. The Office for National Statistics recorded a 13% jump in the number of Americans arriving in London in 2017, with 2.6 million visitors spending about \u00a32.2bn - when $1 was worth an average of 81 pence.\n\nThat helped to offset a slowdown in domestic spending, according to Henry Gregg, from the New West End Company, which represents Central London businesses.\n\n\"For domestic shoppers, it's bad because they see prices increase,\"he said. But it's good for international shoppers who can take advantage of the\"big pricing differential\"in the short term, he said.\n\nLuxury brands have been the biggest beneficiaries of the increase in spending by US tourists, Mr Gregg said. Budget retailers like Primark have also benefitted. It's been\"middle of the road\"clothes stores like Topshop that have missed out, he said.\n\nWhile the number of Americans visiting London increased slightly in 2018, they cut back on spending, forking out \u00a32bn, 8% less than the previous year.\n\nMr Gregg puts the tightening of purse strings down to a normalisation as retailers increase prices to reflect an increase in costs as a result of an unfavourable exchange rate for importers.\n\nBut that's not deterring Americans from bringing their tourist dollars to London, according to the New West End Company, which also tracks room bookings - an early indicator of visitor numbers.\n\nIt said projected visitor numbers would rise 4.8% for June-to-August.\n\nLondon, like New York, is on the must-see list of most tourists.

that forecasts the carbon intensity of electricity up to two days ahead.\n\nIt hopes this will help people to understand and control energy use.\n\nShifting the timing of activities such as running a dishwasher or charging electric vehicles could help relieve pressure on the energy system, reduce the need to use back-up fossil fuel plants, and potentially reduce bills for households.\n\nThe software combines National Grid's knowledge of the energy system with weather data from the Met Office to forecast the share of renewable and non-renewable energy on the grid over the next 48 hours and the resulting carbon emissions.\n\nIt is hoped that technology companies will then develop apps and software that could help people control when and what type of energy they use.\n\nDuncan Burt, from National Grid, said:\"Clear and concise information that can tell you in advance when's best to turn on the washing machine, load the dishwasher or charge your car for example, is a step in the right direction towards a low carbon future. \n\n\"This technology puts people at the heart of it, helping everyone to use power when it's greenest, and likely, more cost efficient.\"\n\n'Landmark development'\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's first subsidy-free solar farm was officially opened on Tuesday. \n\nThe 10 megawatt Clayhill solar farm, near Flitwick in Bedfordshire, will generate enough electricity for around 2,500 homes and save 4,452 tonnes of carbon.\n\nIn addition to the rows of panels there are five battery storage units, to maximise use of power from the solar farm by allowing electricity to be stored and fed into the grid when it is needed.\n\nSteve Shine, executive chairman of Clayhill's developer Anesco, said:\"For the solar industry, Clayhill is a landmark development and paves the way for a sustainable future, where subsidies are no longer needed or relied upon.\"\nTL;DR: More than half the UK's electricity came from low carbon sources this summer, the National Grid says, making it the \"greenest\" summer on record.\n\nArticle: By Leo Kelion & Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology desk editor\n\nAnd despite previous denials that a\"Covid passport\"app was being considered, it is now on the agenda.\n\nAfter all the hoo-ha and costs involved in creating the contact-tracing apps last year, you might think that a very brave decision.\n\nBut earlier this week The Times reported that the facility would be built into the existing NHS app used to access health services in England.\n\nIt is distinct from the NHS Covid-19 app used by England and Wales to warn people if they might have recently been infected, and fewer people have downloaded it.\n\nBut according to Google's own figures, it has been installed on more than one million Android devices (Apple does not share stats for iOS), which represents a decent start.\n\nOfficially, Downing Street says the matter is still under review and it does not want to pre-empt anything by speculating on the subject.\n\nBut it's clear there would be several benefits.\n\nSecurity checks\n\nFirstly, the NHS app, which serves patients in England only, already links up to users' GP services to give smartphone owners access to their medical records.\n\nIn fact, it can already provide a record of whether some people have been given one of the coronavirus jabs, if the GP surgeries involved have shared the information.\n\n(Confusingly, this sometimes appears under the Medicines tab rather than the Immunisations one if you've had an injection and want to check yourself).\n\nSo health chiefs would not need to build new IT infrastructure to get at the information.\n\nSecondly, the app has already tackled many of the security issues involved.\n\nTo set it up you must provide your NHS number, email address, phone number and then upload either an image of your passport or driving licence.\n\nThe smartphone then takes a scan of your face to check it matches the characteristics on the image on your official identification.\n\nAnd then, as a supplement to the automated checks, a human review takes place before you are granted access.\n\nQR codes\n\nHowever, there are still issues to be addressed.\n\nPeople would need to get to the certificate without having to hunt around several menus - possibly via a button at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAnd then the information would have to be presented in a format that someone else could verify quickly and easily.\n\nAnother health pass app points the way to how that might be done.\n\nTested.me displays a scannable barcode over an image of the user's face to provide employers with a means of keeping track of the health status of their staff.\n\nOf course, if the NHS app adopts a similar scheme, it will require other software to be developed so that establishments can verify a person's barcode when they present it.\n\nAnd there are further hurdles to overcome to prevent people who have yet to be vaccinated from simply passing off a screenshot of someone else's code, with their own face edited in, to access a venue.\n\nThat presupposes that it would be acceptable for businesses and other organisations to deny people access to a venue or their workplace if they have not been vaccinated.\n\nAnd one must bear in mind that while vaccines reduce the risk of someone getting seriously ill from at least some of the Covid-19 variants, it is still unknown how much impact they will have on people becoming infected and passing the virus on.\n\nSo the point of having such an app might only be to demonstrate that you would be unlikely to get seriously ill by entering an area, rather than proving you do not pose a threat to others.\n\nForeign travel\n\nA further consideration is that these\"passports\"would probably not be used for travel abroad.\n\nThe World Health Organization is exploring what specifications an international scheme would require to work across borders and support different countries' immunisation programmes. \n\nIt already oversees an International Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate.\n\nAnd the requirements of such a scheme might be different from those used by the NHS app.\n\nOne last issue is whether the government would allow third-party apps to tap into its system to offer specialised vaccine certificates of their own. \n\nThese would be customised for use in certain workplaces or leisure activities, where the details could be stored alongside ticketing or other relevant non-health-related data.\n\nIdentity-check technology provider iProov, whose face-scanning software is already integrated into the NHS app, is among those keen to do this.\n\nIts chief executive, Andrew Bud, pointed out that the NHS already had a mechanism to allow private apps to tap into GP records subject to strict security requirements.\n\nBut whether ministers would want to complicate matters by allowing there to be multiple ways to present a vaccine passport is another matter.\n\nIn any case, speaking to sources within NHSX - the division likely to be responsible for any digital certificate involving the NHS app in England - one thing becomes apparent: discussions about what would be involved are at a very early stage. \n\nAnd that means it will be many months before the idea of presenting an app to door staff to prove you have been jabbed has any chance of becoming a reality.\nTL;DR: As the UK gets closer to easing its coronavirus lockdowns, attention is turning to how we might safely mix again and what role tech might play.\n\nArticle: By Chris QuevatreBBC News

Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster.\"\n\nThere's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.\n\nThree monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.\n\nThe clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like\"Black Mamba\"or\"Green Starfish\"- usually a colour and an animal.\n\nThe business has just won part of a \u00a3500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.\n\nAs apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about \u00a3650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nBut for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.\n\nNow they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.\n\nIt's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with.\n\n\"It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve,\"said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore.\n\n\"We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that.\n\n\"It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle.\"\n\nBluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go.\n\n\"It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications,\"said Mr Cashmore.\n\n\"It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying.\"", "prediction": "A cyber-security company in Plymouth has employed hackers the authorities deemed worthy of a second chance. \n\nSummary:\nThis article provides a summary of the various news articles provided.\n\nThe articles cover a range of topics including:\n\n* Financial exclusion and the need for banks to have a duty of care towards their customers.\n* A Lords committee report on the Personal Independence Payment scheme, which found that the system had been\"rushed\"through and had a\"shocking\"impact on claimants.\n* A Plaid Cymru leader's call for a referendum on Welsh independence.\n* A report on the impact of the weak pound on tourists visiting the US and UK.\n* A story about a 13-year-old boy with autism who has spent two years living in a facility for children with learning disabilities, 90 miles away from his home.\n* A report on the use of technology to control energy use and the introduction of a new subsidy-free solar farm in the UK.\n* A story about a cyber-security company in Plymouth that has employed hackers the authorities deemed worthy of a second chance.\n\nOverall, the articles highlight a range of issues and challenges facing society, including financial exclusion, poverty, inequality, and the need for greater support for vulnerable individuals and communities.\n\nIn terms of the guidelines provided, the summaries aim to be concise and accurate, while also providing a clear and coherent overview of the key points and information presented in each article.

If we don't get every last one, we may as well not have gone there in the first place,\"he said.\n\n\"We have to eradicate, not control, them.\"\n\nClearing an entire island of an invasive species is hugely ambitious but the terrain of South Georgia allows the team to work in stages. Glaciers, which the rodents will not travel across, cover much of the island - meaning that the rat colonies live in isolated pockets and can be tackled separately. \n\nBut time is of the essence. The glaciers are retreating and if the separate colonies are allowed to mingle, eradication will become much more difficult.\n\nSo far Prof Martin's team have faced gale-force winds and blizzards, but with the weather improving they are reported to be ready to resume the largest-ever species eradication project.\nTL;DR: An \"alien invader\" eradication scheme of unprecedented scope will resume on Friday on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.\n\nArticle: Deafness charity Action on Hearing Loss Cymru has made a DVD as part of the personal and social education curriculum for Year 7 and 8 pupils.\n\nIt explains how a typical rock concert is around 100 decibels when the safe listening level is under 80 decibels.\n\nHealth Minister Lesley Griffiths is launching the DVD at Maelor Secondary School, Wrexham, on Friday.\n\nIt will then be sent with a lesson plan to secondary schools across Wales. \n\nCharity director Richard Williams said:\"One in six of us will encounter problems with our hearing, but hearing loss and tinnitus associated with noise exposure could be prevented if people were more informed and aware of how to look after their hearing. \n\n\"Simple actions such as not listening to music too loud, or wearing ear plugs at loud concerts can all help to protect your hearing for the future.\"\n\n'Louder than a drill'\n\nHe said pupils learning about hearing loss and hearing protection as part of their school education was a\"big step forward in helping to reduce the number of people affected by noise-induced hearing loss\".\n\nA spokesperson for the charity, formerly known as the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID),  added:\"Many of the loud noises that we expose our ears to could in fact lead to issues such as tinnitus and hearing loss in the future.\n\n\"The average rock concert exposes the ear to around 100 decibels, louder than a drill or busy train station and much higher than the safe listening level of under 80 decibels.\"\n\nThe Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) estimates 480,000 people in Wales are deaf or hard of hearing.\nTL;DR: Teenagers across Wales are to take lessons on the risks of damaging their hearing by listening to loud music.\n\nArticle: Noye, 70, was convicted of murdering 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in an attack on the M25 in Kent in 1996.\n\nHe was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years in 2000.\n\nLast month the Parole Board said it was not directing Noye's release, but recommended that he be transferred to\"open conditions\".\n\nNoye is expected to be moved to the open prison within about six weeks though no date has yet been set.\n\nA statement from the Ministry of Justice said:\"Public protection is our top priority and transfers to open conditions are made only after a thorough, expert, risk assessment carried out by the independent Parole Board.\"\n\nLive: More on this story and other news from Kent\n\nIn 2015 the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove rejected the Parole Board's recommendation for Noye's transfer to an open prison.\n\nThe BBC's Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said since then Noye has apparently\"expressed remorse and guilt and made progress in rehabilitation\".\n\nEarlier this year he won a High Court challenge against the refusal decision, which his counsel argued was\"unlawful and irrational\".\n\nThe Parole Board can consider him for release in 2019.

The figure for writing in 2011, based on externally marked test results, was 75%.  \n\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said figures from a representative sample of pupils taking an externally marked writing test in 2012 showed 77% of pupils met the expected level. \n\nThe spokesman added:\"This suggests that there would have been a gap between test and teacher assessment outcomes for all pupils at national level.   \n\n\"Some difference between test and teacher assessment results can be expected as the outcomes are measured in different ways. A teacher assessment is the teacher's judgement of a pupil's performance across the curriculum and the academic year, whereas the tests assess a sample of the curriculum for specific pupils on the day of the tests.\n\n\"As no information on writing teacher assessment is available for previous years and the writing sample test results are not directly comparable to test arrangements in previous years, the evidence for a real increase in attainment in writing is less strong.\"\n\nThis year the combined reading and writing scores gave an overall English score of 85% of Year 6 pupils reaching the expected level. \n\nThe proportion of pupils achieving above the expected level also rose. The percentage gaining level five or above in reading rose from 43% to 48% and in maths from 35% to 39%. \n\nGirls and boys did equally well in maths but girls continued to outperform boys in reading, with 90% of girls as opposed to 84% of boys achieving level four or above. \n\nMinister for Education and Childcare Elizabeth Truss said:\"I congratulate pupils, teachers and families on their hard work and achievements. The government is committed to driving up standards by giving teachers more freedom, strengthening discipline and improving teacher quality.\"\n\nChristine Blower of the National Union of Teachers commented:\"The improvements in pupils' reading and maths results are a credit to the hard work of teachers and pupils in Year 6 and throughout the primary sector.  \n\n\"Pupils clearly have well-honed skills in reading for meaning and let us hope pleasure as well. Unfortunately, pupils lower down the primary system, being drilled for the Year One Phonics Screening Check, may be less proficient in these skills as they move through the school and the pressure to'decode' text outweighs understanding. \n\n\"The increased scores in writing, through the use of teacher assessment this year, have proven that it is a more accurate and fair way of assessing pupils' ability. The NUT has long called for national curriculum tests at Key Stage 2 to be scrapped and replaced by teacher assessment which, when moderated well, is as robust an indicator of pupil achievement and progress as the current tests.\"    \n\nHead of the Nasuwt teaching union, Chris Keates, said:\"These results also confirm that the claims of those who continue to be fixated with running down the state education system and decrying its successes are doing so entirely without foundation.\n\n\"It is important to put today's figures into context. For example, in mathematics only 49% of pupils in 1995 achieved Level 4 or above at the end of their primary education.\"\nTL;DR: The proportion of 11-year-olds in England reaching the expected level in reading and maths has gone up, official figures show.\n\nArticle: The first ever UK version of the show is in the middle of its debut season, with the finale on 21 November.\n\nDrag Race features a regular panel of judges made up of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Michelle Visage, BBC chat show host Graham Norton and comedian Alan Carr.\n\nThe second season of the iPlayer show will air next year.\n\n\"I want to thank the BBC and all our fans for their overwhelming support of RuPaul's Drag Race UK,\"Emmy Award-winning host RuPaul said. \n\n\"This season's queens proved that Britain's Got Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent - and I want to see more!\"\n\nThe US version of the show first aired in 2009, has run for 11 seasons and inspired a number of spin-off shows. \n\nSeason one of the UK version, which began airing in October, has attracted 6.5 million requests on iPlayer just over halfway through the series.\n\nCelebrity guest judges on the first season have included actor Andrew Garfield, Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall, singer Cheryl and Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams. \n\nThe show sees drag queen contestants - with names such as Baga Chipz, Sum Ting Wong and Divina De Campo - compete in challenges related to drag queen skills, such as singing, acting and comedy.\nTL;DR: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, the BBC Three drag queen reality competition, has been commissioned for a second series.\n\nArticle: Researchers have found them to have many characteristics still found in modern readers.\n\nThey said medieval people feared illness, were selfish and often fell asleep while reading late at night.\n\nThe work used a technique developed by Dr Kathryn Rudy, which measures the dirt accumulated on medieval manuscripts.\n\nDr Rudy, a lecturer in the School of Art History at St Andrews, realised that the dirtiest pages are likely to have been the most read.\n\nA machine called a densitometer was used to reveal the dirt contained within the pages of books.\n\nOne of the dirtiest pages in a selection of European religious books was a prayer to St Sebastian, who was often prayed to because his arrow-wounds - the cause of his martyrdom - looked like the bubonic plague.\n\nThis indicated that the reader of the book was terrified of the plague and repeated the prayer to ward off the disease.\n\nPages which contained the prayers for the salvation of others were less dirty than those asking for salvation for oneself.\n\nBedtime reading\n\nAs well as demonstrating medieval people prayed for their own assistance, the analysis showed the pages of a prayer to be said in the small hours of the morning were only dirty for the first few pages.\n\nIt has been suggested this shows most readers fell asleep at the same point.\n\nDr Rudy said:\"Although it is often difficult to study the habits, private rituals and emotional states of people, this new technique can let us into the minds of people from the past.\n\n\"Religion was inseparable from physical health, time management, and interpersonal relationships in medieval times.\n\n\"In the century before printing, people ordered tens of thousands of prayer books - sometimes quite beautifully illuminated ones - even though they might cost as much as a house. \n\n\"As a result they were treasured, read several times a day at key prayer times, and through analysing how dirty the pages are we can identify the priorities and beliefs of their owners.\"\nTL;DR: The reading habits of medieval people have revealed details of their lifestyle, in research carried out at St Andrews University.\n\nArticle: The Accounts Commission said funding from the Scottish government fell by 2.3% in real terms in 2017-2018.\n\nIts annual overview of councils across Scotland highlighted the increasing role of council tax funding.\n\nResponding, authorities' umbrella body Cosla said\"councils are at a cliff edge\"and need more financial powers. \n\nThe Scottish government said it had treated local government\"very fairly\".\n\nCouncils have managed to balance funding shortfalls using reserves and council tax rises, the Audit Commission report said.\n\nIt pointed out that an additional \u00a3189m was raised from council taxpayers.\n\nAccording to the watchdog, councils had managed budgets well over the period but face a difficult time ahead.\n\nThe report found that in 2017-18: \n\nThe commission forecasts further reductions in funding in the medium term. \n\nBecause of this, pressure remains on councils to make further savings and find ways of providing services more efficiently and effectively.  \n\nCouncils will learn how much government money they will get in 2019-20 after next month's Scottish budget.\n\nSome are already consulting on possible cuts and savings.

The \u00a3860m worth of cuts we were informed about last week was a real hammer blow\". \n\nMr Jones said his government would\"act responsibly given the hand we were dealt by the Tory/Lib Dem government\"and would look\"to protect community and secondary health services, schools and skills\".\n\n\"These are not just exceptionally difficult times for the Welsh government, however. The current situation also puts an onus on opposition parties in the assembly to behave responsibly in how we decide on our budget. \n\n\"The ritualistic opposition-for-opposition's sake type of politics which usually comes into play at this time of year would be wholly inappropriate in the coming months, as we seek to deal with the cuts that have been imposed on us.\n\n'Substantially better'\n\n\"That is why I am calling on the leaders of the Welsh Conservatives and Welsh Liberal Democrats to work constructively with us in the assembly in the weeks ahead to ensure we make this budget process as painless as possible for the people of Wales.\"\n\nConservative finance spokesman Nick Ramsay said:\"This is a bit rich considering Labour-Plaid's partisan rhetoric over the Spending Review and their refusal to acknowledge what was a fair settlement.\n\n\"As a constructive opposition we are always prepared to work constructively with other parties when it is in Wales' best interests.

It has said in the past that its $470m (\u00a3288m) settlement for those affected by the tragedy was fair and final.\n\nThe Indian government says some 3,500 people died within days of the leak.\n\nIt says that more than 15,000 have died since then.\n\nCampaigners put the death toll as high as 25,000 and say the effects of the leak continue to this day. \n\n'Icing on the cake'\n\nActivists fighting for the survivors of the disaster are calling on the Indian government to officially protest against London 2012's move. \n\n\"Dow as sponsor of Olympics is like a dance on the graves of Bhopal gas victims,\"said Satinath Sarangi of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action.\n\n\"On the one hand, Dow is running away from its liabilities in Bhopal, but on the other hand it is doing [a] public relations [exercise] at the Olympics.\n\n\"We will hold protest rallies in Bhopal, Delhi and in London if necessary,\"he said.\n\nThe campaign is supported by former world hockey champion, Aslam Sher Khan, who has suggested that India should consider boycotting the London Olympics over the issue.\n\nMr Khan was part of the Indian World Cup team in 1975 which won gold.\n\n\"As a citizen of Bhopal and a sports person I am writing to the Indian Olympic Association, the prime minister and the sports ministry objecting to choosing Dow as one of the sponsors,\"he said.\n\n\"Being a big power now, India should lodge a strong protest. Countries in the past have boycotted the Olympics over various issues.\"\n\nDow insists that while the past must never be forgotten, its\"position as a Worldwide Olympic Partner\"represents its\"vision for the future\". \n\n\"Fundamentally, the Olympic Games are about peace, progress, sustainability and the world coming together to celebrate our common humanity. We share that vision and are committed to achieving it,\"a company spokesman said.\n\nDow said that although it\"never owned nor operated the plant and the legal claims surrounding the incident were resolved in 1989, long before Dow acquired Union Carbide, we - along with the rest of industry - have learned from this tragic event and have helped to drive global industry performance improvements to ensure that such incidents never happen again\".\n\nThe Olympic authorities praised Dow for funding an artwork wrap around one of the stadiums. \n\nLondon Olympics chief Sebastian Coe, has termed it\"the icing on the cake\".\n\nA Games 2012 spokesman said:\"Dow was appointed as the supplier of the wrap following a rigorous procurement process. All of our suppliers must work within our own sustainable sourcing code and reflect our values and sustainability requirements.\"\nTL;DR: There is growing anger in India at the decision by Olympics authorities in London to select the Dow Chemical Company as 2012 Games sponsor.\n\nArticle: The Conservatives won 10 out of the 17 wards available, a gain of eight seats since the last election in 2014 but not enough for a majority.\n\nConservative party deputy chairman James Cleverly said the success was\"down to local party workers\".\n\nLabour previously had 25 seats, but now has 17 with the Conservatives close behind with 16.\n\nNeither party was able to secure a majority in Nuneaton, where 18 seats were required in the 34-seat council.  \n\nTory MP for Nuneaton, Marcus Jones, said Labour lost\"crucial marginal seats\"and that seats won at Labour's expense were a\"great result.\"\n\nConservative party deputy chairman James Cleverly said:\"Because of the work our local team put in we got a good result, I'm very pleased with that.\"\n\nSeventeen seats were up for grabs in the election. Labour held 14 of them and lost half - all of which went to the Conservatives.\n\nThe Conservatives also won one seat from the Green Party, which now has one representative on the council.\n\nThe party secured 51% of the vote with a 32% voter turnout. \n\nNuneaton has been seen as a bellwether in recent General Elections, with the Parliamentary seat won by the Tories from Labour in 2010.\n\nThe Conservatives then increased their share of the vote in both the 2015 and 2017 general elections.\n\nThe party also gained a seat on Rugby, Council reinforcing its existing council majority with 24 out of 42 seats.\n\nIn Coventry, Labour retained control of the city council with 40 seats to the Conservatives' 13, with 28 needed for a majority.\n\nOnly one seat in Coventry, Earlsdon ward, changed hands and was won by Labour from the Conservatives. The city had a 27% voter turnout.\nTL;DR: Labour has lost control of Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council by one seat.\n\nArticle: By Mary O'ConnorBBC News\n\nAustralia's strict coronavirus rules left Andrew, an IT worker, unable to get a flight home in time. He had no choice but to say a\"surreal\"goodbye to his beloved 92-year-old mum, Helen, via an online live stream.\n\n\"I really cannot describe the sadness and grief I've felt over the last few weeks, we always thought we were only 24 hours from being home,\"Andrew says.\n\nWhen his mother was taken to hospital after a fall four weeks ago, Andrew and his wife, Anu, 49, searched for flights to Australia, only to find that by the time they could fly there, and finish Australia's mandatory two-week quarantine, they would still be\"weeks too late\"to see his mother.\n\nHeartbroken at being separated from his mum and four siblings in Australia, Andrew and Anu recorded video messages for his sister to show Helen before she died.\n\n\"We told her how much we loved and missed her, and talked about some of the happy memories we'd had together,\"he says. \n\nAfter a\"very emotional\"funeral, Andrew is still struggling to come to terms with his mother's death.\"I don't know if we've really dealt with it from here, it just feels too detached\".\n\nAndrew's experience is one of thousands of stories of heartbreak, anger and separation - after Australia adopted some of the toughest travel restrictions in the world.\n\nIn March, its government urged Australian citizens and residents living overseas who wanted to return home to do so as soon as they could. \n\nDays later, the country closed its borders to everyone except Australian citizens and permanent residents. \n\nThe government has restricted people from leaving the country without an exemption, and few are given. All arrivals into Australia must quarantine in a designated hotel for 14 days, at a rough cost of about $3,000 (\u00a31,650) per adult.\n\nAustralia also brought in strict limits on the number of arrivals allowed to enter the country - with a cap of about 4,000 people per week. And airlines - who must comply with the caps - have been regularly cancelling flights and tickets.\n\nAbout 27,000 Australians stranded overseas have registered with the government to come home, Australian officials have said. But earlier this month, the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia - which represents airlines - estimated there were likely to be 100,000 Australians stranded overseas, including 30,000 in the UK.\n\n'I was told to find a homeless shelter'\n\nFor Sandi James, a PhD researcher, qualified psychologist and teacher, what was supposed to be a 10-day working trip to Dublin has turned into months of being stranded in the UK with no job or stable accommodation.\n\nSandi, 51, travelled from Australia to a conference in Dublin in March, where her wife Jennifer, 54, joined her from Thailand. \n\nSandi was then due to travel to Malaysia for work - but says hours before she could board the plane, the country closed its borders. Thailand did the same that month.\n\nSandi travelled to London after being offered a room to stay in while she was waiting to return to Australia. She tried to book a flight home in April, but the earliest she could get one was 6 July.\n\nWith no job or permanent place to live, she phoned the Australian High Commission in London for help, but says they told her to contact a local council about homeless accommodation.\"I hung up the phone. I just couldn't speak. I wanted to scream at them.\"\n\nThe Commission did not respond to the BBC's request for a response to this claim.\n\nAfter her first flight was cancelled, Sandi was unable to take another last minute flight and says she has\"given up\"on trying to get back to Australia.\n\nSandi, who is currently staying in a hostel in Bristol, says the whole ordeal has severely damaged her mental health. She has now started the expensive process of applying for an ancestry visa in the UK, in a bid to secure work, and hopefully bring Jennifer here.\n\n\"I am stuck here alone, and am really struggling. I can't do this on my own anymore, I need her.\"\n\nFor first-time mum Carly McCrossin, 38, every day her five-month-old daughter, Ailish, grows is a heart-wrenching reminder that her family back in Australia are missing out on those special moments.\n\n\"I was getting so upset, because I would be putting away her new-born clothes,\"she says,\"and bringing out the three-month age clothes.\"\n\nHer mother was due to fly to the UK before Carly gave birth. But during a\"horrible\"phone call, Carly and her husband, who live in south London, agreed she shouldn't come to the UK, fearing she may get stranded here - a decision they had just hours to make before the borders closed.\n\nUnable to\"do nothing\", she has launched a campaign, Fly the Babies Home, with the aim of chartering a plane to fly other lockdown babies to Australia to meet their families.\n\nWith 400 families registered so far, Carly has begun the\"slow process of getting things to happen\", including talking to airlines and charter companies. So far the cheapest private charter quote came in at about \u20ac900,000 (\u00a3497,000) for a return.\n\nThe Australian government is due to review the caps on people coming into the country on 24 October and recently said it will increase capacity to about 6,000 people per week. But many stranded Australians say this is not enough.\n\nAnd it could be too late for Carly. She had planned to fly home with Ailish in October for three months before returning to the UK in January. \n\nInstead she's left looking at baby clothes that no longer fit her daughter.\"I just kept asking myself, how has my mum not seen my baby?\"\nTL;DR: Last Thursday, Andrew Leslie, 52, woke up at 04:30 BST at his east London home for his mother's funeral. It was taking place some 10,000 miles away in Sydney, Australia.\n\nArticle: The trouble broke out after a number of bands defied rulings made by the Parades Commission. \n\nThe restrictions were put in place after a loyalist band was filmed playing a contentious song outside a Catholic church in July.\n\nOther bands, which were restricted to playing a single drum beat, also breached the ruling.\n\nOne officer was taken to hospital, but none have been seriously injured.\n\nThe return leg of the parade on Saturday evening passed off largely peacefully.\n\nThe Parades Commission had barred the Young Conway Volunteers band from marching past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street.\n\nIt made the ruling after the Shankill Road-based band was filmed walking in circles outside the same church while playing a contentious song on 12 July.\n\nAt the time, the Young Conway Volunteers said it was\"pure chance\"that they had come to a halt there and insisted they were not playing the Famine Song, an anti-Irish song that originated in Glasgow.\n\nOn Saturday, the bands returned to the area to take part in a Royal Black Institution parade.\n\nA number of protesters were separated from the march by a large police presence - including many officers dressed in riot gear. \n\nThere was a loud cheer from a crowd of supporters during the outgoing leg of the parade, as the first band walked past playing a regimental army march. \n\nThe trouble broke out as the last of the bands marched past the church.\n\nA spokesperson for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers came under attack by people throwing stones and bottles.\n\nA policewoman was treated for minor head injuries but has since been released from hospital.\n\nThe Parades Commission said any breach of the determination would be a matter for the police to investigate and they may refer it to the Public Prosecution Service.\n\nThe officer in charge of the operation, Assistant Chief Constable Dave Jones, said it was the PSNI's assessment that\"there have been breaches of the Parades Commission determination on both the outgoing and return legs of the parade\".\n\nACC Jones added:\"I can assure the public that people will be held to account for their actions today and using the evidence we have gathered, breaches of the Parades Commission determination will be reported to the Public Prosecution Service. \n\n\"I will allocate additional resources to the investigative team to ensure their work can be actioned immediately,\"the officer said.\n\nThe Royal Black Institution held parades at six locations across Northern Ireland on Saturday.\n\nAbout 17,000 members took part in Belfast, Larne, Ballynahinch, Portrush, Cookstown and Plumbridge.\n\nThe City of Belfast Grand Black Chapter demonstration was held in the city for the first time. \n\nThis year, it marked the centenary of the signing of the Ulster Convenant.\n\nAbout 63 preceptories were on parade in the city, including 2,300 members of the institution. They were accompanied by 33 bands. \n\nRestrictions were also imposed on music being played during the feeder parade past the Ardoyne shops and past Catherine Court off the Shore Road.\n\nA number of residents' associations were granted permission to hold protests at the parades.\n\nThe Royal Black Institution in Belfast had criticised the Parades Commission's rulings ahead of Saturday's event.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"The time has long past when the commission should be confined to the dustbin of history. \n\n\"They are parasites living on the misery their determinations bring to communities as they propagate cultural apartheid and exercise a Stalinist-like desire to control and dictate cultural expression.\"\n\nThe Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective, which opposes parading by loyal orders along a contentious stretch of the Crumlin Road, at Ardoyne shops, also criticised the commission.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"These contentious marches only serve to poison community relations and further alienate and polarise our peoples, and all just to pander to the will of a few bigots who use culture as an excuse to mask and impose their outdated and obsolete triumphalism upon our community.\"\n\nThe statement said the march was not welcome on the stretch of road past Ardoyne shops and an alternative route should be used.\nTL;DR: Seven police officers have been injured during a contentious loyal order parade in Belfast city centre. \n\n\n\nArticle: The event, one of the largest in the of its kind in Europe, starts on 4 June.\n\nOrganisers said that in 2014 there had been safety issues on the A685 when people arrived too early with trailers.\n\nRestrictions will be put in place to reduce roadside parking, but there will be spaces provided for traditional bowtop caravans and horse grazing.\n\nDr Robin Hooper, chief executive of Eden District Council, said:\"People arriving too early with trailers are not respecting the fair and are disrupting the outlying communities around Appleby.\n\n\"So please, plan your journey well and use the stopping places provided.\"\nTL;DR: Gypsies and travellers planning to attend the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria have been warned not to arrive before it begins.\n\nArticle: Tamara Thurgood struggled to pull the snake off her son after it bit him repeatedly on the face while he slept, relatives said online.\n\nMs Thurgood told local media it was\"like a nightmare\"as she fought to free her son.\n\nShe said Tyler, 6, had his eyes closed during the ordeal and could not remember being bitten.\n\nTwo male relatives who were called to the property at Eungai Rail in northern New South Wales killed the snake.\n\nSnake experts described the encounter with what was probably a 2.5m (8ft) coastal carpet python as an\"unfortunate chance meeting\".\n\nBryan Robinson, a wildlife management specialist for Queensland Fauna Consultancy, told the BBC it was an unusual scenario.\n\nMr Robinson said snakes usually bite for self defence, and around 95% of people bitten were either trying to catch or kill the reptile.\n\n\"It doesn't mean the snake was attacking him, the kid could have rolled on him in his sleep,\"he said.\"Human beings do not fit into the prey selection of any Australian snakes.\"\n\nRelatives said Ms Thurgood wanted to share her story online in the hope it would help other families protect their children.

The potential is it will increase the value at least five-fold.\n\n\"The council needs to capitalise on the work that's already done. \n\nBody boarders\n\n\"It's 90% there and it would be wrong to just stop and write it off at this point.\"\n\nThe artificial reef, Europe's first, was created to improve surfing conditions using 55 sand-filled\"geotextile bags\"which are 225m (740ft) out to sea.\n\nBut Mr Weight said it was mainly being used by body boarders - who do not stand up on boards like surfers - because the waves are abrupt, which causes difficult conditions for surfing.\n\n\"The performance is somewhat less than it should be,\"Mr Weight said.\"I do not think it needs a great deal physically to make it a great deal better.\"\n\nThe task group will report back to the council by October.\n\nThe council spokeswoman added:\"The council has a \u00a3150,000 funding envelope already allocated to the surf reef, and ASR is the only company to design artificial surf reefs, with the greatest global experience in building them, and therefore these will both be considerations for the Task and Finish Group.\"\nTL;DR: It opened more than a year late and at a cost of \u00a33m, nearly double the amount councillors had originally planned for. \n\nBut problems for Boscombe's artificial reef are far from over.\n\nArticle: Sandip Singh Atwal, of Birmingham, went to hospital for injuries to his hands and lip after he was attacked in 2008.\n\nMr Justice Spencer, sentencing him at the High Court, said 14 allegations of contempt had been proved against Atwal and he\"could have made many more\".\n\nIt is thought to be the first time an NHS trust has brought such proceedings.\n\nMore stories from Yorkshire\n\nCalderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust was given permission because it was\"an attempted fraud on the health service\", said Mr Justice Spencer.\n\nAtwal had been found in contempt of court in April.\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Atwal, who was working in his family's taxi firm, was injured in an attack with a baseball bat and went to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.\n\nHe was treated for fractures to the index finger of his right hand and the ring finger of his left hand, and a laceration to his lower lip.\n\nHe said the treatment he received was negligent and had left him unemployed and dependent.\n\nHe later brought a claim for negligent treatment, admitted by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, who offered \u00a330,000 to settle the case.\n\nThis was\"if anything, a generous offer\", said the judge.\n\nHowever, Atwal asked for \u00a3837,109, including very substantial sums for future loss of earnings and care, on the basis he was unable to work and grossly incapacitated.\n\n'Dishonest exaggeration'\n\nBut the DJ -

Nestled in suburban Burnaby, British Columbia (BC), there is little sign the pipeline project has become a battlefield.  \n\nThe site is central to a fight over climate change and Canada's economy, the environment and the oil sector - between those who argue the pipeline project could devastate the Pacific coastline and those who say it will fuel the economy for years to come. \n\nThe current peace is just a lull as sides regroup in the wake of a court ruling that dealt a blow to the project in August.\n\nThat federal appellate court decision quashed Canada's 2016 approval of the project, saying regulators failed to adequately consult First Nations along the pipeline route and to fully account for the project's impact on the region's endangered killer whales. \n\nIt was handed down the day Canada finalised its C$4.5bn ($3.4bn; \u00a32.6bn) purchase of the 65-year-old pipeline from Kinder Morgan. \n\nThe Texas-based energy infrastructure company agreed to sell the infrastructure amid myriad legal and regulatory challenges launched against their expansion plan.\n\nThe C$7.4bn project would twin the existing 1,150km (715 mile) pipeline and increase capacity from 300,000 barrels per day to 890,000 per day from Alberta, the heart of Canada's oil industry, to Burnaby, BC. \n\nIt would add roughly 980km of pipeline, new pump stations, and expand the dock facility and pipeline capacity at the Burnaby marine terminal.  \n\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline route\n\nIt would also increase oil tanker traffic on BC's coast from five to up to 34 tankers a month, tankers that would carry the oil along from Pacific coast refineries to Asian markets.  \n\nJim Leyden was one of many arrested this year for violating a court injunction that prevents protesters from obstructing work at the site. \n\nPolice also arrested federal Green Party leader Elizabeth May and newly elected Vancouver mayor Kennedy Stewart, who pleaded guilty in spring to one count of criminal contempt. \n\nLeyden, however, has no plans to plead guilty. \n\n\"We didn't say'Come here and arrest us,'\"he says.\"We came here and said'Stop this work'. We came here and said we don't want our land decimated, we don't want our waters decimated.\"\n\nSusan Lambert, a former BC Teachers Federation president, was sentenced to a week behind bars for her part in the protest. \n\nThe retired teacher said she decided to take a stand\"because of the critical point we're at in terms of climate change\".\n\nThey are joined in their concern by some First Nations and environmental groups, which have led organised campaigns against the expansion. \n\nThe current BC government and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby have also fought the proposal. \n\nIn October, Washington state's governor said the project\"runs counter to everything Washington state is doing to fight climate change, protect our endangered southern resident killer whales, and protect communities on both sides of the border\". \n\n\"There's a wall of opposition here along the coast,\"says Christianne Wilhelmson, with the Georgia Straight Alliance, which focuses on protecting the coastal waters. \n\nOne cause for for their concern is a potential oil spill in the Salish Sea, a busy inland network of waterways ranging from just north of Vancouver to Puget Sound in Washington. \n\nThe sea is also the home to an endangered killer whale species under significant threat from - among other factors - marine vessel noise. \n\nThose whales captured the world's attention earlier this year when a mother in one of the pods carried her dead newborn calf with her for some 17 days in an extended display of grief. \n\n\"That was such an eloquent and mute statement about the precipice we're on,\"says Lambert. \n\nSince the court ruling, Canada has asked the National Energy Board (NEB), an independent regulator, to hold a new round of consultations with the 117 indigenous groups affected by the project and to take a second look at project-related marine shipping. \n\nBut pipeline opponents have little faith in this latest review, which they see as simply another path to yes for Trans Mountain. \n\nThe court decision is\"not a victory, it's just a reprieve. But the struggle continues\", Lambert says. \n\nPatricia Mohr, an economist and commodity market specialist, puts the case for Trans Mountain this way:\"Oil pays the bills in Canada, oil pays the rent\". \n\n\"Canada is a trading nation. We owe our relatively high per capita income, our economic prosperity to trade,\"she says. \n\n\"It's really important that we have international markets for some of our big volume product exports, and crude oil happens to be the biggest.\"\n\nTrans Mountain has its defenders, not least Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who says Canadians don't have to choose between a clean environment and resource development, and who launched an oceans protection plan prior to Trans Mountain's approval to help shore up support. \n\nHe says expanding the pipeline is in the country's national interest. \n\nCanada, with its landlocked oil supply, sells almost all its oil to the US, getting a lower price for it than it would with access to global markets. \n\nTrans Mountain would increase capacity to move Canadian oil to the coast, and from there to energy hungry markets in Asia and elsewhere. \n\nIn Alberta, anger and frustration has settled in. Trudeau was met by pro-pipeline protesters during a recent visit to the province. \n\nCanadian crude oil have fallen to record lows and the\"crisis\"in the sector is linked to a lack of pipeline capacity. \n\nThe province is refusing to participate in Trudeau's national climate plan until the project is approved. \n\n\"The idea of damning the lifeblood of your modern economy to us - as a resource sector-heavy country, as a resource-rich country - is irrational,\"says Kris Sims, with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a low-tax advocacy group. \n\nThe Alberta government estimates that a lack of market access is currently costing the Canadian economy up to C$80m a day.\n\nStewart Muir, with Resource Works, a non-profit organisation that promotes BC's resource sector, says:\"Giving away our oil to the US is not only imprudent as an economic policy but also, I think, morally reprehensible to use non-renewable resources in such a careless manner\". \n\n\"You've got one shot to use that hydrocarbon molecule well, and we're giving it away to Donald Trump and his friends for a huge discount.\"\n\nAdvocates also note that shipping the product through a pipeline is generally safer, more efficient, and cheaper than by road or rail. They argue that the project can be built responsibly with environmental risks mitigated. \n\nIn the past few years, a number of oil pipelines projects have been proposed in Canada - Northern Gateway, the Energy East Project, Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain Expansion. \n\nThe two former project have been cancelled. Keystone XL and Trans Mountain are both on hold.\n\nMohr says the failure to get pipelines built has slowed investment in Canada's oil sector. \n\n\"We need to prove to the international investment community - by which I mean particularly investors in New York and London - that we have the means to get our infrastructure put in place for what I believe is our most important industry,\"she says. \n\nLabourers too are feeling the pinch, workers who had banked on the long-term construction jobs Trans Mountain promised.\n\nChristian Labour Association of Canada's Ryan Bruce says some 3,000 of the union's members had planned to work on the pipeline once construction got under way in earnest. \n\n\"Anytime you see a large number of jobs evaporate suddenly, it hits the economy, it hits small town British Columbia, it hits rural BC and rural Alberta where this pipeline was going to be passing through,\"he says.\n\nGrand Chief Stewart Phillip has a term for the Trans Mountain project:\"a real stinker\". \n\nHe leads the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, which has been a strong anti-pipeline voice in the province. \n\n\"You cannot build a pipeline in a war zone,\"he told journalists in October.\"It's impossible. You have to have the goodwill and the support, the social license. For indigenous people you have to have consent.\"\n\nFirst Nations communities against Trans Mountain have found support from indigenous communities and organisations across Canada. \n\nBut those communities along the pipeline are not unified in opposition. \n\nTrans Mountain has signed 43 mutual benefit agreements with First Nations in BC and Alberta. The corporation estimates it will share in excess of $400m with them under those agreements. \n\nLeaders who signed those agreements say they have built a partnership with Trans Mountain that will create opportunities in their communities for years to come. \n\nThe NEB launched its reconsideration hearings on 19 November. Its report is due in February, and both sides will be watching Trudeau's next steps. \n\nSophie Harrison is with Dogwood Initiave, a BC political advocacy group that has organised against the project.  \n\nShe says she is betting against the Trans Mountain expansion being built\"but I do think it will be interesting to see how hard Trudeau is wiling to try\". \n\nSims, whose low tax group backs the project, though not the infrastructure and construction costs being transferred to the public, believes that if the Trudeau government can thread the needle, Trans Mountain will be eventually pumping more oil to the coast.  \n\n\"There is that little window - it's almost like the Millennium Falcon [scene in Star Wars] where it has to turn sideways and go through the pass. There is a gap of light there,\"she says. \n\nBut she says the question is:\"Do they really have it in them - the fire in the belly? Is it in their hearts to get this thing done?\"\nTL;DR: Canada recently spent billions on an oil pipeline in order to triple its capacity. But amid fierce opposition to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plans, will the Trans Mountain project ever get built?\n\nArticle: 1.'Many months' before NHS back to normal\n\nWhile much attention has been focused on the NHS's ability to cope with the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, there are continuing concerns that people with non Covid-19 health concerns are putting off seeking treatment. Now, three think tanks have warned it could take many months to restore services disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n2. Antibody test'very positive development'\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) has approved a test, developed by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, that can determine whether someone who has had Covid-19 has developed antibodies, which might lead to a level of immunity to the disease. While previous tests lacked reliability, PHE says this is the first one to offer serious potential.\n\n3.'No predictions' for when coronavirus may disappear\n\nThe world may have to come to terms with the continuing existence of coronavirus, a leading figure in the World Health Organization has warned. Dr Mike Ryan said no-one should try to predict when the virus might disappear and that, even if a vaccine is developed, it will take a\"massive effort\"to bring it under control. He likened Covid-19 to HIV, which has no vaccine, but which the world has come to terms with.\n\n4. What are coronavirus'bubbles' and how might they work?\n\nOne idea that has been floated as a way of easing restrictions on seeing other people without risking the further spread of coronavirus is that people might nominate\"bubbles\"made up of family and/or friends with whom they could have social contact. The idea is being examined by government advisers.\n\n5. Back to school in Denmark\n\nChildren in Denmark have been back at school for a month now.

We'll have another update for you this evening. \n\n\n\nArticle: Mao Zedong, founder of the People's Republic of China (PRC), reportedly called Australia the\"lonely continent\". These days, though, going from the recent ups and downs in the bilateral relationship, Australians feel anything but lonely. \n\nChina supplies to Australia a huge and ever-increasing number of tourists, overseas students, and, since 2010, has been the nation's biggest trading partner. \n\nIts investments have also increased exponentially - but posed increasingly probing problems because of fears by Canberra about security and interference.\n\nHow did we get here? \n\nIn the past decade, Australia has changed national leader five times. For all their differences, prime ministers from Mandarin speaker Kevin Rudd to today's Scott Morrison have had one thing in common - they have all found that dealing with China is never simple. \n\nThis is not through lack of trying to find a model that works. Mr Rudd tried the\"true friends speak truth to each other\". That fell apart on the shoal of accusations by Beijing that he was actually too close to the US, allowing marine troops to rotate in the northern port of Darwin. \n\nJulia Gillard tried expanding the canvas to aim for an Asia-wide approach. But the simple fact that China loomed so large in Asia made that hard to implement, and Tony Abbott quickly phased out this approach when he was elected in 2013. \n\nHe attempted to get closer to Japan. It might have worked - had he lasted more than two years in the brutal atmosphere of Canberra, or, for that matter, had Japan really offered a financial proposition remotely as tempting as Beijing's. \n\nFor Malcolm Turnbull, early promise from his years of being a high-level lawyer and strategist of a more pragmatic, balanced relationship was scuppered by allegations local and national politicians had been influenced by Beijing. Anti-interference legislation followed. \n\nNow Mr Morrison follows the same zig-zag path - tough on China in his language, but needing to accept the brute reality that for the country's future prosperity, China still offers the best potential bet. And as his meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this week showed, courtesy almost always returns.\n\nWhy is this such an issue? \n\nAfter all, when China's President Xi Jinping visited the country in 2014, he stood before the parliament in Canberra and said they needed to be more ambitious and adventurous in their vision towards the PRC. And China liked things like the rule of law, and the institutional predictability of Australia. Why would it seek to disrupt these attributes?\n\nPart of the problem is simply about size. China's emergence as such a key player, perhaps the key player, for Australia - a nation of a mere 24 million people with vast space around its shores to police, and a navy of only 27,000 - was always going to be disorientating. \n\nAdd to this mix the ways in which this whole phenomenon brings to the fore some deep, but often concealed, vulnerabilities in Australia's national psyche. This is a country that has never, until recently, had to conceive of itself as an Asian one, despite its geographical location. \n\nEurope was the major source of its migration till recent decades, and America of its security and much of its economic growth. Now Australia is receiving large numbers of new citizens whose families come from the region, including many from China. \n\nAustralian universities are a good case study. Some have many thousands of Chinese students, meaning that these typically liberal institutions are dependent on funding from a stakeholder with very different values. \n\nA recent Four Corners documentary from the national broadcaster ABC contained almost paranoid claims that a large number of this cohort posed a security risk through their political interference, and the ways they operated potentially as technology spies. \n\nThere are cases of some academics feeling under pressure on issues like Taiwan, Hong Kong or Xinjiang. The Chinese government and its agents have sometimes acted in a heavy-handed way. Even so, it is easy to see why some Chinese might feel bewildered that their contribution to the coffers of the country in which they are coming to study and gain new skills is interpreted in such an ominous way. \n\nChallenge for Australia\n\nThe simple fact is that no Australian leader has ever really addressed the other part of the China equation. They have been keen to talk, when it suited them, about the threats posed by this vast and very different new partner in terms of values and world view. But they have been far less keen to talk about the fears of their own country, and the issues it has with itself. \n\nOnly Mr Abbott offered any real insight into this, when in a moment of unscripted candour he stated, off-camera to Angela Merkel, that the Australian attitude to China was typified by\"fear and greed\". \n\nAustralia can eschew investment, students, and opportunities from China, and sometimes does - Huawei is an example. But a wholesale attempt to do this, and seek partnerships in the Indo-Pacific for instance, would mean a big sacrifice, and significant reorientation of its mindset. \n\nIt seems that at the moment Mr Morrison is following the footsteps of his predecessors, and taking a highly contradictory attitude. That might be for the very simple harsh reality that, for all the confident talk of standing up to the China threat, his administration, and his country, has no other option. \n\nKerry Brown is professor of Chinese Studies and director of the Lau China Institute at King's College, London. From 2012 to 2015 he was professor of Chinese politics and director of the China Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.\nTL;DR: Australia and China continue to trade accusations and placations in an escalating row with far-reaching consequences. But amid criticisms of Beijing, Australia has long failed to properly scrutinise itself, writes China-Australia expert Kerry Brown.\n\nArticle: Phil Edwards was arrested on 31 May on suspicion of sexual activity with a boy and was found dead on 17 June.\n\nHertfordshire Police has since been contacted by 16 people who have made complaints about Mr Edwards, The Athletic reported.\n\nThe force said it is\"unable to investigate further\"due to his death.\n\nMr Edwards was a physiotherapist at Watford FC in the 1990s.\n\nThe club was first notified of allegations relating to the 60-year-old in June and has since been conducting an internal investigation, as well as co-operating with the police.\n\nMr Edwards was arrested on 31 May as the police investigated an allegation of sexual activity with a teenage boy and abuse of a position of trust at an address in Watford on 26 May.\n\nHe was released on bail pending further inquiries but was found dead in 17 June.

The bilingual school in Zehlendorf teaches German and American children.\n\nReports say one bully blew e-cigarette smoke in the boy's face, saying\"that should remind you of your forefathers\"- a sarcastic reference to the Holocaust. \n\nBullies also reportedly drew swastikas on post-it notes and stuck them on the boy's back. \n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nBefore 1989, Germany's Jewish minority numbered below 30,000. But an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.\n\nHow bad is anti-Semitism in Germany?\n\nBerlin's Anti-Semitism Research and Information Office (RIAS) says anti-Semitism is expressed on various levels, and not only by neo-Nazis, or by Muslim extremists who hate Israel.\n\n\"There is overall a worrying development of anti-Semitism becoming more socially acceptable. It has grown over the last couple of years and many cases go unreported,\"researcher Alexander Rasumny at RIAS told the BBC.\n\nRIAS documented 947 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, including 18 physical attacks, compared with 590 in 2016. The watchdog's annual report (in German) said the increase was partly a result of more Germans reporting such incidents to RIAS, having learnt of its work. \n\nIn an interview (in German) with the daily Der Tagesspiegel, the German government's new anti-Semitism tsar, Felix Klein, spoke of\"a brutalised climate now, in which more people feel emboldened to say anti-Semitic things on the internet and in the street\".\"Previously that was unthinkable, but the threshold has dropped.\"\n\nWhat other incidents have hit the headlines?\n\nIn April two young men wearing traditional Jewish skullcaps (kippahs) were assaulted in Berlin. The attacker, a 19-year-old migrant from Syria, was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. \n\nLater Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, advised Jews to avoid wearing kippahs. But in solidarity, thousands of Berliners wore kippahs on 29 April, declared an\"action day\"against anti-Semitism. \n\nTwo German rappers, Kollegah and Farid Bang, were investigated recently over their gangsta rap lyrics which referred insultingly to Auschwitz victims and the Holocaust.\n\nThey were not prosecuted, but were taken on an educational visit to Auschwitz, where the Nazis murdered an estimated 1.1m Jews during World War Two.\n\nRhetoric from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has fuelled concern about anti-Semitism. An AfD leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, drew strong criticism after he condemned Berlin's Holocaust memorial.\n\nWhy this focus now on schools?\n\nMr Schuster says schools must take anti-Semitism seriously and not sweep it under the carpet.\n\n\"Such incidents happen in all types of school and all over Germany,\"he warned.\n\nOne boy subjected to anti-Semitic taunts at a Berlin school was given a separate room to use during breaks, as well as a separate entrance, RIAS reported.\n\nAnother Jewish boy was removed from a school by his parents after a gang had tormented him for months and threatened him with a realistic-looking toy pistol.\n\nMr Rasumny told the BBC that anti-bullying action had to involve awareness training for teachers, because\"they don't always recognise current forms of anti-Semitism, or know when and how they should intervene\".\n\nThere have been cases of anti-Semitism even among kindergarten children.\n\nThere is much under-reporting of incidents in schools, Mr Rasumny said.\"There is pressure to conform to the rules, not to be different, and often kids report bullying only if they can't stand it any more,\"he said.\n\nIn one case, he said, a Jewish music teacher had left a school after being told by a pupil there that\"God wants Jews to die\". It emerged that another teacher had said something similar to the child's mother. \n\nGerman schools should teach children about Jewish history and culture as a whole, Mr Rasumny said, in order to tackle anti-Semitism.\"It's very important to educate about the Holocaust, but German Jewish history did not just start in 1933 and end in 1945,\"he said.\nTL;DR: The German government plans to send 170 anti-bullying experts into schools after the summer break to tackle anti-Semitism among children.\n\nArticle: Officers were called to Ravenscroft Place in the Richmond area of Sheffield on Saturday 4 July.  \n\nSouth Yorkshire Police said a post-mortem investigation confirmed the woman died of stab wounds.\n\nThe 36-year-old man was released by officers, but a 41-year-old woman remains in custody.\n\nPolice said the unnamed victim was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. \n\nPolice said:\"Please check your CCTV or dashcam footage and contact us if you have any information that might help.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

This was one picky customer and she didn't even buy a lot of vegetables - only one or two items for as little as she could pay. On this occasion it was a lettuce for 500 won (about $0.40; \u00a30.33). \n\nUttering only a few words, Han handed over her money and left with her son.\n\nJust a few weeks later, both were dead. \n\nHaving fled food shortages in her native North Korea and dreaming of a new life, Han and her son are believed to have starved to death in one of the wealthiest cities in Asia. Their bodies lay undiscovered for two months until someone came to read the water meter and noticed a bad smell.\n\nMother and son were found apart on the floor. The only food in their tiny rented apartment was a bag of red pepper chilli flakes. \n\n'If only she'd asked...'\n\nOne of the last people to see her alive was the vegetable vendor in the street outside her apartment complex. She saw her in spring - around the same time the police say Han withdrew the last 3,858 won ($3.20; \u00a32.60) in her bank account. \n\n\"Thinking back, it gives me shivers,\"she said.\"At first I hated her for being picky, but now I think about it, I am sorry for her. \n\n\"If only she'd asked nicely, I would have just given her some lettuce.\"\n\nShe's one of many we spoke to who are asking questions which begin with the phrase\"If only\". If only the authorities had noticed her plight. If only the government had done more to help defectors. If only she'd asked for help.\n\nTheir horrific deaths have prompted outrage and anger and a great deal of soul searching.\n\nHan's journey to freedom as a North Korean defector should have made her remarkable, but in this city of 10 million people, she appears to have been invisible. Very few people knew her. Those who did, say she spoke very little and would walk around almost disguising herself with a hat and avoiding all eye contact. \n\nBut this city knows her now. \n\nHer photograph has been placed among flowers and gifts in a makeshift shrine in Gwanghwamun in the centre of Seoul. Dozens of mourners are shouting her name through loudspeakers, though few there knew her personally. \n\n\"It just doesn't make sense that after going through all that hardship and challenges to come to South and she dies of starvation. It breaks my heart,\"one defector mourning at the shrine told us.\"When I first heard the news, it was too absurd to believe. \n\n\"This cannot happen in South Korea. Why did nobody know about this until they died?\"\n\nBut one of the reasons no-one knew is because Han appears to have wanted to stay hidden.\n\nA laugh with a dark side\n\nEscaping North Korea can feel almost impossible. More people have attempted to scale Mount Everest this year than leave the impoverished state. Even if you get past the soldiers and surveillance at the border, defectors face a journey of thousands of miles through China. Their aim is to get to a South Korean embassy in a third country. Usually in Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam. \n\nBut getting through China is a huge risk. If caught, they're sent back to North Korea and could face a lifetime of hard labour in one of its notorious gulags. Female defectors who hand money to disreputable brokers hoping for help often find themselves imprisoned and sold as brides or sex workers.\n\nIn Han's case, it is difficult to verify how and when she left North Korea. Two defectors who claim to have spoken to her believe she was sold to a Chinese man as a bride and had a son with him. We cannot verify this account.\n\nBut she arrived in Seoul alone, 10 years ago, and certainly didn't open up to many of her classmates at the Hanawon centre. \n\nAll defectors face a mandatory 12-week basic education at such a centre, affiliated with Seoul's Unification Ministry, to adjust to life in the South. Han's class was one of the largest since the centre had been set up. It had more than 300 people in it. They all knew how hard it was to get through China. \n\n\"I knew she went to China first. I knew because even when she laughed and was bright, there was a dark side,\"one of her classmates told us. \n\n\"I asked her what was wrong but she brushed me off. \n\n\"I'm the type of person not to push too much on personal matters, so I said,'I don't know what it is, but if you go outside, as long as you work hard you can live a good life. South Korea is a place that you get what you work for. You're young and beautiful, you won't have a hard life. Whatever you do don't be ashamed and live with your head up'.\"\n\nHan appeared to do well in her new life at first. The authorities help defectors find subsidised apartments, and she along with six of her classmates were settled in the same neighbourhood, Gwanak-gu. \n\n\"She was so pretty and feminine,\"her classmate said.\"I believe she was the second person after me in our class to get a job. At first, she worked briefly at a coffee shop in Seoul University. Even there, I heard she made a good impression. What we remember is that she was smart, feminine and we thought she was someone who would be able to take care of herself. \n\n\"We didn't expect this to happen.\"\n\nIt is difficult to find out how, from this promising start, Han ended up destitute. She was so private. \n\nTwo defectors in her apartment complex told us they believe she had persuaded her Chinese husband to move to South Korea. As a family, they relocated south to Tongyeong where he worked at a shipyard. She had a second son who was born with learning difficulties.\n\nEventually it is thought her husband went back to China without her, taking the eldest son with him. She was left alone with no job and caring for a disabled child.  \n\nHer neighbours say she missed her older son terribly.\n\nShe moved back to where her South Korean life had started - the subsidised housing apartments in Gwanak-gu in Seoul. She applied for help at the community centre in October last year and received 100,000 won ($94) each month in child allowance.  \n\n\n\n12weeks of adaptation training\n\n$6,000-$32,400settlement benefits (depending on size of household)\n\n$13,300-$19,100Housing subsidy\n\nFreeeducation in public schools and universities\n\nIt is at this time that Han and her son appear to have fallen through a gap in the welfare system.\n\nShe could have claimed much more than the universal child benefit. A single parent is entitled to six to seven times that amount each month. But that would have required a divorce certificate and it is our understanding that she didn't have one.\n\nThe community centre staff said they visited her apartment for their annual welfare check in April but she wasn't home. They were not aware of her son's condition. She hadn't paid the rent of her subsidised apartment or her bills for some time. In some other countries this would have raised a red flag to social services. It doesn't appear to have happened in South Korea.\n\nShe was also no longer eligible for help as a North Korean defector because the protection period of five years had expired.\n\n'This is a death by indifference'\n\nWhen they gathered at the shrine in Gwanghwamun, in front of Han's smiling portrait, the debate among the defector community continued.\n\n\"This is absurd, how ironic a North Korean escapes hunger and comes to South to die of starvation!\"\n\n\"What did the South Korean government do? This is death by abandonment.\"\n\n\"This is a death by indifference.\"\n\n\"Where is the system, where is the police?\"\n\nHowever her former classmate said this is not how she wants her friend to be remembered. \n\n\"I don't want to cause a row, pointing fingers at whose fault this is. We should just come together as one and vow to never let this happen again. It really hurts my heart how things are turning out, how people are taking advantage of this for their purpose.\"\n\nSo what lessons can be learned?\n\nThe last reports we received about Han from a neighbour claim she was distracted and anxious. A far cry from the bright woman who arrived at the Hanawon centre 10 years ago.\n\nAt no point did Han ask for help. But should help have come to her?\n\nMental health care for North Korean refugees is one area that could be improved, according to defectors and psychiatrists. Most defectors have suffered a number of human rights violations and trauma ranging from extreme hunger, sexual assault, being forced to witness public executions and the fear of human traffickers in China. \n\nThe rate of psychological trauma is higher among those who have travelled through China, according to a study by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. \n\nDr Jun Jin-yong from the National Centre for Mental Health said it is common for defectors to suffer anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. But because there are so many stigmas associated with mental health in the North, many aren't aware that they're suffering or that help is available. \n\nAnyone suffering mental illness in North Korea is sent to a hospital in the mountains called Number 49. Most never return. It is perhaps understandable that North Koreans are unaware that psychiatric help is available.\n\n\"We need services that are more defector-friendly and to guide defectors to find these services,\"Dr Jun said. \n\n\"Defectors have a lower approachability than South Koreans on mental health issues because they have a prejudice against mental health. So we should continue to advertise mental health support to defectors so that they can receive help.\"\n\nAccording to a settlement survey of North Korean refugees in South Korea, about 15% admit to having suicidal thoughts. That's about 10% higher than the South Korean average. Most say economic hardship is the main reason they feel unable to cope. \n\nThere is also more of a sense of community in North Korea. We've been told that, north of the border, Han and her son would not have been allowed to shut themselves away in their apartment.  \n\nJoseph Park who also escaped from North Korea 15 years ago, decided to run coffee shops in Seoul to cultivate a community for defectors. He believes the shocking deaths of Han and her son were not caused by a lack of government policy, but can be partly blamed on certain aspects of South Korean culture.\n\n\"South Korea is a society where you can live without relationships. In North Korea you need relationships to survive,\"he told us. \n\n\"I think that's the big difference. In South Korea, you can survive without having a relationship with your neighbour. But in North Korea, you need relations with your neighbour and the system forces you to have relations as well. \n\n\"For example, in North Korean schools, if someone doesn't come to class, the teacher would send all the classmates to the missing student's house. So naturally, there can't be anyone left out. In North Korea it would be not possible for someone to be out of touch for a month like that.\"\n\nThousands of North Koreans live hugely successful and fulfilling lives in the South. But it does require them to change and to adapt to their neighbours' ways. Defectors have told numerous studies they are made to feel different, and face discrimination.  \n\nThe results of a post-mortem on Han and her son are expected soon, but South Korea's Unification Ministry is already examining Han's case in the hope lessons can be learned. \n\nWhat is clear is that those from North and South often still feel separate  - even when they live in the same city.\n\nPerhaps Han's story should give pause for thought for all in Seoul in the hope that this society will never again have to ask itself, if only.\nTL;DR: Han Sung-ok, 42, seemed determined to pick through nearly every lettuce on the market stand. She turned each one over and examined it while her six-year-old son clambered on the fence nearby.\n\nArticle: By Chris FoxTechnology reporter\n\nLaunched in 2011 and competing with Facebook and Twitter, it was Google's fourth attempt at a social network.\n\nBut the platform failed to win people over, even after Google pushed it upon the thriving YouTube community.\n\nBy the end of 2011, analysts were already writing obituaries.

Then, in 2013, it wrapped its tentacles around YouTube. \n\nFollowing the merger, anybody who wanted to comment on YouTube videos had to have a Google+ account.\n\nThe move attracted fury from prominent video-makers who felt their success was being used to prop up the struggling social network.\n\nApp reviewers on the Google Play store were also required to have a Google+ account.\n\nSuddenly Google+ appeared to be alive with activity, as YouTube comments,\"liked\"videos and app store reviews were automatically cross-posted on the platform.\n\nGoogle boasted that the platform had 500 million users - but how many were engaging?\n\n\"I look at the profiles of the family and friends I invited to join and find that their presence in Google's shiny new world ranges from sparse to non-existent,\"wrote BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones in 2011.\n\n\"The big question is whether the 750 million people who currently use Facebook and the 100 million who are signed up to Twitter will decide they need to move - or need yet another social network in their lives.\"\n\nWhat killed Google+?\n\nIn April 2014, the founder of Google+, Vic Gundotra, left the company and changes came swiftly.\n\nSuccessful features such as Hangouts and Photos were separated from Google+ and run as independent services.\n\nGoogle started to disentangle Google+ from its apps such as YouTube and Google Play, much to the delight of video- and app-makers.\n\nIn 2015, Google+ had a makeover designed to focus on\"communities\"but this also failed to ignite interest in the platform.\n\nIn the end, it was the discovery of two data breaches that spurred Google to close the platform.\n\nIn 2018, it admitted bugs in its software meant the private information of up to 52 million members had been accessible by third-party developers.\n\nSuddenly, Google was happy to admit that few people genuinely used the platform.\n\n\"The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement - 90% of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds,\"it said in a blog.\n\nGoogle+ has now been commemorated on both the Google Graveyard the Google Cemetery websites, which keep a record of the search giant's failed projects.\n\nThe Google Cemetery site was created by Naeem Nur\"to make my friends keep on working on their new ideas, even if they fail\".\nTL;DR: Google+, the search giant's failed social network, will finally be laid to rest on Tuesday morning.\n\nArticle: By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the BBC, Babar Ahmad accused the police and prosecutors of mishandling his case.\n\nMr Ahmad has been battling against extradition to the United States. He will find out next Tuesday if he will be sent to America.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service have denied impropriety.\n\nThe unprecedented interview in the maximum security Long Lartin Prison came after the BBC challenged a government ban on filming Mr Ahmad.\n\nThe High Court ruledthat there was an overwhelming public interest in hearing Mr Ahmad discuss his case, because of his unique situation.\n\n\"I have been in prison now for nearly eight years without trial,\"Mr Ahmad said.\n\n\"I am facing extradition to the US to spend the rest of my life in solitary confinement. I have never been questioned about the allegations against me.\n\n\"I do not hold the Americans responsible for anything that has happened to me, but I think it is fair to say that I am fighting for my life - and I am running out of time.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old from Tooting in south London was arrested in 2004 on an extradition warrant from the United States.\n\nUS prosecutors say he headed a terrorist\"support cell\"in London through a website called Azzam.com. He faces life imprisonment if convicted.\n\nScotland Yard had arrested Mr Ahmad the previous year, but released him without charge.\n\nIn his BBC interview, he says that the seven years he has spent in prison battling the US warrant are the result of a failure by British authorities to charge him.\n\nEvidence'not considered'\n\nHe claims material seized during his arrest was sent to the United States, rather than being used against him in a trial in the UK.\n\n\"Had the Police and CPS put me on trial in 2003, which they have could have done, I would have left prison years ago - regardless of the verdict at trial.\n\n\"But due to the inability of the police to pass the case onto the CPS, they outsourced my case to the Americans and asked them to seek my extradition. As a result of that, I have been in this nightmare fighting extradition for the last eight years.\"\n\nMr Ahmad says his lawyers have lobbied the CPS to bring charges in this country, saying that other suspected terrorists have been prosecuted here for comparable offences.\n\nSome of these suspects have been prosecuted for having material that originated from the website he is alleged to have run.\n\n\"They can resolve this now by bringing charges against me tomorrow. They have all of the material. I would urge the director of public prosecutions to consider this file.\"\n\nHis case has been with the European Court of Human Rights and a judgement has been repeatedly delayed because of complicating factors.\n\nNext Tuesday, the court will rule on Mr Ahmad's extradition, along with other terrorism suspects wanted by the United States.\n\nKey allegations\n\nMr Ahmad's alleged website played a key role in the late 1990s onwards in creating and providing support for Mujahideen fighters across the world.\n\nAlthough he is not charged with direct involvement or membership of al-Qaeda, the US says he supported Chechen fighters, the Taliban and also received a classified US Naval document.\n\nMr Ahmad refused to say whether he ran the mujahideen website, saying he had a right to clear his name in a trial in the UK.\n\nBut he added:\"I absolutely reject any allegation that I supported terrorism in any way, in any place, whether in Afghanistan, Chechnya or any other part of the world. I believe terrorism to be wrong and I believe the targeting and killing of innocent people to be wrong.\"\n\nIn a statement, Scotland Yard said:\"The Metropolitan Police Service carried out their investigation strictly in accordance with UK law. This process involved close liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service. We completely reject any suggestion of impropriety.\n\n\"All extradition requests made to the United Kingdom are subject to the Extradition Act and any other relevant legislation. The CPS acts as the representative of the requesting judicial authority in extradition proceedings.\"\n\nMore than 140,000 people signed an official government e-petition last year supporting his campaign against extradition, making his case one of only 10 petitions to have garnered enough support for a House of Commons' debate.\n\nThe CPS confirmed to the BBC that it has only seen\"a small number of documents gathered as evidence by the police in this country\"and those had been insufficient for a prosecution.\n\n\"At the time this decision was made, domestic prosecutors were aware of the nature of the evidence in the possession of the US, but the entirety of the evidence was never subject to review in this country as it formed part of the case built by the US and was held there.\"\n\nMr Ahmad's lawyers say that the publicly available US papers show that the American charges are based on British evidence.\n\n\"This case has been heard extensively throughout the UK courts who have held that the US authorities have jurisdiction and are entitled to seek Mr Ahmad's extradition. Mr Ahmad has appealed those decisions and is now awaiting the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.\"\n\nYou can find out more about this story and watch the full interview on Newsnight on BBC Two at 2230BST on Thursday 5 April 2012, then afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.\nTL;DR: A British terrorism suspect, held for a record seven years without trial, has appealed to be prosecuted in the UK. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News\n\nThe western-style adventure is set in the aftermath of a failed train robbery and is actually the prequel to the original 2010 title.\n\nIt's the first major release for studio Rockstar Games since the launch of Grand Theft Auto V in 2013.\n\nReviewers have praised its advanced graphics and storytelling, but the studio has also faced criticism. \n\nHere are five things to know about it.\n\n1. The game files are enormous\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 requires 107 gigabytes of installation space on the Xbox One. \n\nOn the PlayStation 4 it's 99GB with an extra 50GB required for installation, the studio has said.\n\nAccording to the games site Games Radar that makes the game the heftiest PS4 download ever.\n\nSecond on its list was Battlefield 4 Premium Edition, weighing in at 71GB.\n\nThe game is so big because of its expansive world and attention to tiny details (more on that in a moment) - but it could prove an obstacle to fans with slow broadband and limited storage.\n\n2. Those little details...\n\nOne of the reasons why the game is so enormous is that there are a lot of exquisite little details.\n\nThe detail that has inevitably caught everybody's attention is that apparently when the weather is cold, a certain part of the horse's anatomy can be seen to shrink. \n\nLike in Grand Theft Auto, the weather conditions and even interactions between the 200 species of in-game wildlife are auto-generated, and each item held by the main character, Arthur Morgan, is individually rendered so it moves in its own right as he rides on his horse.\n\n3. RIP Horses\n\nSpeaking of horses - in Red Dead Redemption 2, if your horse dies, it stays dead. You won't see it again. People are very sad about this.\n\n4. Long working hours for studio staff\n\nIn a Vulture magazine interview, Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser praised staff for working 100-hour weeks to get Red Dead Redemption 2 finished. \n\nIt had already missed two previous launch dates - Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 - on the grounds that it wasn't ready.\n\nMr Houser has since clarified that he was referring only to himself and three other members of the senior writing team. \n\nHowever so-called\"crunch culture\"is a controversial area of games development, where developers can be asked or feel obliged to work long hours in the run-up to a title release.\n\n\"The problem is that most people in games get into games because they love them, and that lets companies take advantage of these,\"said Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings creator Mike Dailly.\n\n\"They push developers to work these stupid hours, yet they could easily release the game with a little less content, and it would still be a massive game.\"\n\n5. The gameplay takes 60 hours\n\nDan Houser told Vulture magazine that the 60-hour story mode was shortened from 65 hours in the edit by abandoning a love interest. \n\nFor context, experiencing everything Grand Theft Auto V has to offer would take more than 100 hours, Mr Houser told The Guardian in 2013 when it came out.\n\nHowever it's often said most gamers don't ever finish a game - CNN once put the figure at 90%.\nTL;DR: The hotly anticipated game Red Dead Redemption 2 is due for release on Friday.\n\nArticle: Carers Wales has issued a five-point plan calling for more support for the growing number of families looking after sick loved ones.\n\nIt estimates around 370,000 people in Wales are providing care that would otherwise cost the state \u00a318 an hour.\n\nThe figure represents a rise by over a third since the last estimate in 2007.\n\n\"Carers contribute so much and they deserve better in return,\"said Carers Wales director Roz Williamson.\n\n\"Our society and public services could not function without the massive contribution made by the 370,000 carers in Wales and the six million carers in the UK. \n\n\"This contribution is something we can be proud of as a country, and demonstrates how strong our families and communities are. \n\n\"With an ageing population, caring is becoming a fact of life for every family. \n\n\"Yet, whilst families are meeting this challenge, many are struggling with little or no help, or facing cuts to the care services and benefits they rely on. \n\n\"Unless we urgently rethink how our society supports carers, we will see increasing numbers pushed to breaking point - forced out of work and into poverty, ill-health and isolation.\"\n\nCarers Wales outlined five proposals the charity believes are needed to provide sufficient support to carers. \n\nIt wants an urgent review of carer's allowance, which it says is the lowest benefit of its kind and it is calling on the UK Government to rethink proposed cuts to disability benefits.\n\nCouncils are also being urged to protect funding for social care services to preserve the independence and dignity of disabled and older people while providing support to their families who care for them.\n\nIt also wants reform and sustainable funding of the care and support system to recognise carers' contribution and allow carers to live healthy lives alongside caring.\n\nAnd a new approach to supporting carers involving all parts of the society has been called for.\n\nThat would include employer support in the workplace and being supported in communities.\nTL;DR: A charity claims the unpaid work done by carers in Wales is worth \u00a37.7bn a year.\n\nArticle: Pre-tax profits for the year to 31 March fell to \u00a3415.6m, from \u00a3444.6m last year. Revenues fell 1% on an underlying basis to \u00a32.5bn.\n\nThe firm also said this year's profits would be at the lower end of forecasts.\n\nBurberry plans to revamp its retail operations and is aiming to make annual savings of at least \u00a3100m by 2019.\n\nChinese market\n\nThe group, famous for its trench coats and distinctive check pattern, has been hit by a slowdown in Chinese tourists visiting its stores in Europe, and weak demand in Hong Kong.\n\nWhile group like-for-like sales were down 1%, the company said if results from Hong Kong and Macau were excluded, then sales would have been up by 3%. \n\nThe company said Hong Kong, which accounted for 9% of its global retail and wholesale revenue, had suffered a\"significantly lower footfall\".\n\nIt expects the majority of its future growth to come from Chinese customers, who already account for 40% of Burberry's retail sales.\n\nThe company said it was focusing on improved service, as well as bespoke products and campaigns for this market.\n\nJohn Botham of Invesco Perpetual said:\"The growth in Chinese consumer spending has slowed and that is an issue for Burberry.\n\n\"Another issue is traditionally Hong Kong has been the place Chinese people have travelled to on holiday and increasingly they are travelling to Japan and that is a place where Burberry isn't particularly strong.\"\n\nBritish heritage\n\nBurberry said that after relaunching its trench coat and scarves it would now focus on bags, which is an area growing faster than clothing.\n\nIn November, it announced it was unifying three lines under a single Burberry label and planned to develop a manufacturing and weaving facility in Yorkshire. \n\nIt is aiming to highlight Burberry's British design heritage emphasising that all the products are designed and developed in London.\n\nBurberry chief executive Christopher Bailey said:\"While we expect the challenging environment for the luxury sector to continue in the near term, we are firmly committed to making the changes needed to drive Burberry's future outperformance, underpinned by strong brand and business fundamentals.\"\n\nNo senior manager changes were announced, despite reports that Burberry was looking to bring in support for Mr Bailey, who has been managing the creative and business side of the company since the previous chief executive, Angela Ahrendts, left in 2014.\n\n'Great brand'\n\nBurberry's business is split into wholesale, which sells clothes to other retailers, and retail, which consists of its own branded outlets.\n\nIt plans to relaunch its online shopping site, and introduce a customer app to drive sales.\n\nBurberry's shares slid 2.71% to 1112p after it said that full-year profits in 2017 would be\"towards the bottom of the range of analysts' expectations\".\n\nSteve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said this, together with cost cutting, offered little comfort in the short-term.\n\n\"There is a great brand at the heart of Burberry, but it needs stronger Chinese demand to shine.\n\n\"The reductions in longer term market growth expectations are disappointing, but reflect the new reality,\"he added.\nTL;DR: Fashion firm Burberry has reported a fall in full-year profits and said it expects the \"challenging environment for the luxury sector to continue\".\n\nArticle: A return to end-of-course examinations\n\nThe biggest change in GCSEs this year was the return to linear exams - with all pupils sitting their tests in the summer at the end of the two-year course. \n\nStudents have no longer had the option to take exams on the parts of the qualification at several points during their courses because so-called modularised GCSEs have been scrapped.\n\nThere are a number of views on what impact this will have.\n\nMany see the return to summer-only exams as toughening the qualifications - more knowledge has to be remembered all in one go. And with pupils sitting numerous subjects, it has been a congested exam timetable for many pupils.\n\nSome people see the removal of all those bitesize bits and pieces of learning that characterised the modular system as an opportunity to engage in some deeper teaching and learning of the syllabus.\n\nSome coursework remains but it has been limited.\n\nChanges to GCSE English/English language\n\nThe major change here is that the results of the speaking and listening part of the qualification do not now count towards final English/English Language GCSE grades.\n\nIn the past this part of the qualification has been assessed by teachers and there were claims in 2012 of a high degree of inconsistency in the way teachers in different schools marked the assessments.\n\nOfqual's answer was to remove it from the overall result. However, candidates still have to take a speaking and listening assessment and the results of this will be reported alongside a student's final result using grades 1-5.\n\nThe balance between exam and controlled assessment (where candidates complete work in a controlled class environment) has also been changed. \n\nWritten exams will count for 60% of the English GCSE while controlled assessments will count for 40%. It used to be the other way round.\n\nEnglish is particularly important to schools because it was one of the key subjects it is measured by in league tables.\n\nWhat about early entries?\n\nChanges to the way GCSE results are measured in school league tables have discouraged schools from entering children early for their exams. \n\nThis step was taken because data suggested that entering pupils for GCSEs earlier was not generally in their favour and the earlier they entered, the less well they did.\n\nMany schools entered many Year 10 pupils - those in their first year of GCSEs - for certain subjects such as English and maths for a variety of reasons, including allowing pupils a couple of goes at the exam and giving potentially wayward students more of a focus by testing them earlier.\n\nBut with only the first crack at the exam now counting for school accountability measures, there has been a huge drop-off in early entrants.\n\nThe overall number of entries from students in Year 10 and below fell by 40% on the previous year. Some experts believe this change could lead to a slight rise in grades overall as many of the poorer candidates will not sit the exams inappropriately early.\n\nWhat does Ofqual say about all this?\n\nThe chief exams regulator Glenys Stacey says her watchdog's priority is to maintain standards between one year and the next. Students must not be unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by a change in the syllabus.\n\nIts approach is that if a group of students taking a qualification in one year is very similar, in terms of ability, to those who took it the previous year, then results would be very similar overall.\n\nBut the changes outlined above mean that both the examinations and those taking them are different.\n\nOfqual says this means results are likely to look different from previous years. However, Ms Stacey insists schools and parents can be sure that standards have remained the same.\n\nHowever, she does acknowledge that there is likely to be variability in results at the school level.\nTL;DR: Changes to the GCSEs this year have led to England's exams regulator, Ofqual, predicting a higher degree of variability in results - so what's making the difference?\n\nArticle: The Met Office said the strongest winds had now passed for the UK, where four people were injured by falling trees.\n\nNumerous road closures and public transport delays were caused by trees and debris during the storm.\n\nAs the storm swept into France, a skier was killed by a falling tree in the Alps and 15 others injured elsewhere.\n\nIn Cornwall, some residents have been advised to leave their homes at high tide because of a collapsed stone harbour wall in Portreath. The council says the advice is a precaution.\n\nThe Met Office said that during the storm gusts of more than 70mph were recorded across much of the UK.\n\nThe strongest gusts were 100mph recorded at Great Dun Fell in Cumbria at 01:00, 90mph at Orlock Head, Northern Ireland and 89mph on the Isle of Wight.\n\nPower restored\n\nMore than 25,000 homes in Northern Ireland lost power but this has been restored to most of them, with fewer than 1,000 homes still without electricity.\n\nAbout 400 homes in Wales have had power restored.\n\nScottish and English provider SSE said it had restored power to 18,000 homes since midnight after outages caused by the storm.\n\nIn Worcestershire, a man was injured by a falling tree and another man was treated by paramedics after a tree fell on a car in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nIn Hinton Admiral, Hampshire, two people were freed from a car, which had been struck by a tree during the heavy winds, at about 03:00.\n\nBoth men were taken to hospital, since then the driver has been arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs while at the wheel.\n\nA body was recovered on the coast of East Sussex at about 08:00, after the remains were spotted in the water. It was not known whether the person was swept into the water by the weather conditions.\n\nAs the storm made landfall on mainland Europe, flights to the UK were affected. \n\nDutch carrier KLM cancelled a number of flights between Amsterdam Schiphol airport and London Heathrow. \n\nOther flights between the Netherlands and Manchester, London City, Leeds Bradford and Southampton airports were delayed. \n\nOverturned vehicles led to closures on the A1M, M6 and M5, where a recovery operation was under way to clear up the contents of a lorry left spilled on the road.\n\nSeveral major bridges were closed due to high winds.\n\nIn Buckinghamshire,\"flying trampolines\"ended up on lines near Aylesbury.\nTL;DR: Thousands of homes lost power and travel was disrupted after Storm Eleanor battered the UK with gusts of up to 100mph (161kph).\n\nArticle: More than 85,000 were shifted -

There are currently four versions of the android with more in development.\n\nOne of them is being trained on Earth to find a pulse in a dummy's neck using ultrasound, then to stick a needle into a vein.\n\n\"You want to avoid hitting the carotid artery,\"Dr Garami says.\n\nThe robot has great potential for precise work, he says. \n\nFor example, once it can give an injection, it will be able to find the same spot on a human body and use the same angle for the needle again.\n\nHe sees the robot eventually being used to perform intricate medical operations like endovascular surgery, where a patient is operated on through their large blood vessels.\n\nRobot cleaner\n\nBut in the short-term Robonaut 2 faces a more mundane role as the space station's cleaner\n\n\"The robot has to earn its stripes,\"Robonaut project leader Ron Diftler tells the BBC.\n\nThe machine has already been given\"very boring tasks\"on the International Space Station such as monitoring air flow from vents, he adds.\n\nRobonaut 2 was shipped up to the space station as just a torso, head and arms. \n\nIt is still waiting for a pair of legs to arrive on a forthcoming supply mission, but afterwards the robot should be able to begin to clean handrails, wipe down interior surfaces and other basic jobs.\n\nThe next stage is for it to learn to walk in, then to go outside the station to do maintenance tasks.\n\nIts legs will have seven joints and cameras in the feet, so it will be able to\"see\"where it is going.\n\nEventually, the robot will perform\"dull, dirty, and dangerous\"jobs in inhospitable places, Mr Diftler says.\n\nRobot control\n\nRobonaut 2 can be remotely controlled by a ground crew member using a virtual-reality face mask and gloves.\n\nThe human controller can see what the robot sees, and manoeuvre it using gestures.\n\nHand and neck position data from the virtual reality kit are transmitted from the Houston command centre into space, and a video feed and data are beamed back.\n\nIt can also be controlled through keyboard commands on a laptop.\n\nThe robot has five eyes as part of its vision system, and can\"see\"the same wavelengths of light as a human, plus infrared light.\n\nIt has two high-resolution visible light cameras that transmit stereoscopic video to its operators, and two back-up cameras. It's\"mouth\"is actually an infrared camera to aid its depth perception.\n\nThere is no room in its head for a brain, so the aluminium and steel robot\"thinks\"with its stomach, which is packed with powerful processors.\n\nThe fingers have tendons that run into the forearm of the robot in a similar way to the human arm.\n\nWhen the robot touches an object, tiny sensors on the fingers measure the force the robot is applying, and allow for a soft touch.\n\nRobonaut 2 has not been designed to have super-human strength, but it's strong by human standards - it can lift and move a 20lb (9kg) weight around in Earth's gravity with one arm.\n\n Time lag\n\nOne of the main challenges in surgical telemedicine is the time lag between the surgeon's movements and what the robot does, according to telepresence expert Gordon Mair from the University of Strathclyde.\n\n\"If you were to make an incision, there would be a certain amount of time before the robot did it,\"he explains.\n\nThis could seriously affect an operation, as even a second's delay could mean the robot makes too deep or shallow an incision.\n\nThe signal takes time to transmit over long distances, with the time lag becoming longer as the distances get bigger. \n\nThe time lag for signals between Earth and the International Space Station can be up to a couple of seconds, and can cut out for much longer periods, Mr Diftler adds.\n\nFor missions to Mars, the lag could be 20 or 30 seconds, making the problem worse.\n\nOne possible way around the issue would be for astronauts inside the station to control the robot.\n\nIt could offer them an extra pair of hands, for example helping apply pressure on a wound during an operation.\n\nThe robot could also be programmed to act autonomously during parts of an operation, with a controller commanding it to go through a sequence of stages.\n\nRobonaut 2 already has some capabilities to act by itself in various tasks. \n\nFor example, Mission Control can tell it to pick something up, and it can use its vision system to locate the object, identify it, then reach out and grab it.\n\nThe automaton has a long road ahead of it before it can become an autonomous surgeon, but Nasa's big plans may see the robot go from space station toddler to medic on Mars.\nTL;DR: It won't panic in an emergency, its hands don't shake after too little sleep, it won't miss a family after months away from base - in fact it doesn't even need to breathe.\n\nArticle: By Ewan MurrieBBC Scotland news website\n\nKellyanne Conway, 32, from Glasgow, said dozens of Facebook users had confused her with a US namesake at Trump HQ.\n\nThe Glaswegian was forced to issue a disclaimer on her profile that warned she was the\"wrong Kellyanne Conway!\".\n\nShe said her family were\"howling\"with laughter at some of the messages.\n\nMs Conway told BBC Scotland she could see the funny side after she received an array of\"strange\"emails including one that thanked her for\"boarding the Trump train!\".\n\n'A right laugh'\n\nThe 32-year-old, an office administrator, said her family and co-workers had been amused at messages sent to her from people trying to contact a senior adviser at Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.\n\nShe said:\"It's been so funny - me and the girls at work have had a right laugh about it.\n\n\"My family are absolutely howling [with laughter] too.\"\n\nThe office worker, employed at JR Group in Paisley, said messages had been sent to her intermittently throughout the US presidential race, but she was inundated with dozens more after the US President-elect was announced.\n\nMs Conway said the disclaimer on her Facebook profile has not helped much, as she has continued receiving the messages.\n\nWhen asked if she was a fan of the US President-elect, the Scottish office worker said that while she does not have strong views on American politics, Mr Trump was\"not really her cup of tea\".\nTL;DR: A Scottish woman has been inundated with online messages from people who confused her with Donald Trump's campaign manager.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent\n\nA huge shadow cast by the Moon as it passed in front of the Sun swept across the nation, from Oregon in the west to South Carolina in the east.\n\nMillions of people moved to get into the path of darkness, putting on their protective glasses to gaze at the sky in wonder.\n\nIt was the first total solar eclipse visible from America's lower 48 states in 38 years, and the first since 1918 to track from coast to coast.\n\nThe spectacle got under way in earnest in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST).\n\nSkywatchers gathered at coastal beaches and towns witnessed the Sun's disc being completely obscured by the Moon for two minutes.\n\nBut just before and just after\"totality\", they also got to see some of the classic features of a full solar eclipse.\n\nThese included\"Baily's beads\"which arise as the last shafts of sunlight drive through valleys on the Moon; and the\"Diamond Ring\", which is the single brilliant point of light that signals the beginning and end of totality.\n\nFrom Oregon, the eclipse shadow raced on through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. It was a journey that took roughly 90 minutes.\n\nSmall towns along the path were inundated with visitors. So were the National Parks.\n\nIn Carbondale, Illinois, city authorities billed their locality as the\"Eclipse Crossroads of America\"because it would enjoy totality both on Monday and when the next US eclipse occurs in 2024.\n\nAs anticipated, Carbondale proved to be a huge magnet to skywatchers who made good use of the more than 60,000 extra car parking spaces organised for the day.\n\nThe area also had the privilege of enjoying the longest period of darkness anywhere in the country at just over two minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nThe Atlantic coastal city of Charleston was the place tasked with saying goodbye to the eclipse. Beachgoers experienced the full shadow at 14:48 local time (18:48 GMT; 19:48 BST).\n\nAlthough, the US had exclusive rights on totality, a partial eclipse was visible across all of North America, reaching beyond the Canadian Arctic; as well as across the north of South America down to Bolivia.\n\nIn Washington DC, President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, made sure they had protective glasses as they looked skyward.\n\nParts of western Europe were also set to see the Moon take a chunk out of the Sun at the end of the day just before the star dipped below the horizon.\n\nIt was just a small bite, but in parts of France and the Canary Islands where clouds were limited - it was no less of a spectacle.\n\nFor those outside the path of the Moon's shadow or smothered by poor weather, there was always the internet.\n\nThe US space agency (Nasa) streamed pictures from many vantage points including from a series of helium-filled balloons.\n\nSome of the most spectacular shots of the day came from orbit.\n\nItalian astronaut Paolo Nespoli looked down on the moving shadow from the International Space Station.\n\nAnd from their\"stationary\"positions some 36,000km above the planet, meteorological satellites also returned some stunning imagery.\n\nThe next total solar eclipse on Earth is on 2 July, 2019, over the South Pacific, Chile, Argentina.\n\n Try our solar eclipse calculator\n\nWhen is the next eclipse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Calculator\n\nNext Solar Eclipses\n\nRead more from Nasa\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: A total solar eclipse has wowed the US.\n\nArticle: Louise Porton killed Lexi Draper, three, and 17-month-old Scarlett Vaughan in Rugby in 2018. The 23-year-old had researched how long it took for body parts to go cold.\n\nThe part-time model denied responsibility for their deaths but was convicted at Birmingham Crown Court.  \n\nProsecutors said her daughters\"got in the way\"of Porton's sex life. \n\nJurors were told Lexi had been dead for some time on 15 January before her mother called for help. When the call handler asked if the girl was breathing, Porton replied\"no\".\n\nFewer than three weeks later on 1 February, her second daughter, Scarlett, was found\"completely lifeless\".  \n\nPorton, from Beechwood Court, Rugby, had called 111 because her daughter's condition\"did not seem urgent\". The toddler had died by the time paramedics arrived nine minutes later.\n\nBoth Lexi and Scarlett's deaths were consistent with deliberate airway obstruction. Doctors\"could not find any natural reason why either, let alone both, should have died\", prosecutors said.\n\nDuring her trial, jurors heard how Porton did not seem distressed by her daughters' deaths.\n\nShe admitted sending nude photographs to a photographer and offering sex acts in return for money while Lexi was in hospital in early January.\n\nThe girl had been admitted on 4 January with breathing problems. Her symptoms were consistent with deliberate airway obstruction, however doctors at the time were not suspicious and put her condition down to a chest infection. \n\nThe day after Lexi's death, on 16 January, Porton accepted 41 friend requests on the dating app Meet Me and was also messaging men on another app, Badoo.\n\n\"My little girl passed away yesterday,\"she said to a man named Dave, as they chatted about her leg tattoo, before replying\"its alrite [sic]\"to his condolences.\n\nShe also arranged a date with a man named Leon that night and was overheard laughing in a funeral parlour days after Lexi died.\n\nPorton denied that her online searches, including\"can you actually die if you have a blocked nose and cover your mouth with tape\"and\"how long after drowning can someone be resuscitated?\", had anything to do with Lexi and Scarlett's deaths.\n\nShe said she had loved her daughters who were\"always making me laugh\", but conceded to jurors that parenting was\"not one of the easiest things to do\".\n\nThe children\"got in the way of [Porton] doing what she wanted, when she wanted and with whom she wanted,\"Oliver Saxby QC, prosecuting, said.\n\nThe girls' father, Chris Draper, did not have contact with them and had never met Scarlett, something he said made their deaths\"all the more heartbreaking\"for him.\n\n\"The only comfort is that Lexi and Scarlett are together,\"he said.\n\nDet Supt Pete Hill, from Warwickshire Police, said:\"I will never be able to understand why Louise Porton murdered her children. \n\n\"She has lied repeatedly to friends, family and professionals to cover her tracks.

Detectives have arrested 210 people and interviewed others under caution. \n\nScotland Yard's investigations\n\nThe investigations began with Operation Weeting - examining hacking at the News of the World - and then branched out into Operation Elveden - looking at allegations of corrupt payments to public officials. Police then launched a third plank to look at computer hacking and misuse of data. \n\nOperation Pinetree is now looking at allegations of a second conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World. Then there is Operation Golding which is investigating Mirror Group Newspapers \n\nThere have been eight convictions relating to hacking since 2006, when private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and royal editor Clive Goodman were first jailed. \n\nAhead of the 2013-14 hacking trial, five people pleaded guilty: Glenn Mulcaire for a second time, reporters Dan Evans and Neville Thurlbeck, and news editors Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup. Andy Coulson was then found guilty. \n\nIn Operation Elveden there have been 14 convictions of public officials for taking or seeking payments - seven of them police officers. \n\nFuture cases and decisions\n\nIan Edmondson, a former News of the World news editor, will be tried at a later date for alleged conspiracy to hack. He was excused from the Coulson trial due to ill health. \n\nThere are 59 people from Elveden still to face trial - plus potentially a retrial of Andy Coulson and Clive Goodman after the jury at the hacking trial could not reach verdicts on the corruption allegations they faced.\n\nOne of the big trials in the pipeline concerns alleged activity at The Sun and involves Bettina Jordan-Barber, a former Ministry of Defence official who was paid close to \u00a3100,000 for stories. Trials are also due to continue throughout the autumn and well into the New Year. \n\nSome 31 people are on police bail waiting to find out whether they will be charged under Operation Elveden. A further 20 are waiting for decisions relating to the various hacking strands. \n\nSome of the journalists held under Elveden have waited for more than a year to find out whether they will have to answer criminal charges. One person arrested on allegations of computer hacking has been waiting for a decision since July 2012. \n\nCorporate prosecution? \n\nOn top of all that, the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service are looking at a possible corporate prosecution.\n\nA company can face trial if illegal acts were carried out by senior figures who acted as the controlling mind of the organisation. So prosecutors would have to prove that Andy Coulson's criminality, as editor, represented the will of the newspaper's parent company. \n\nNews International's former chief executive, Les Hinton, has been interviewed under caution. He worked for NI for almost 50 years and was Rupert Murdoch's right hand man. Scotland Yard also want to question Rupert Murdoch himself. \n\nRupert Murdoch's News Corp is also co-operating with parallel investigations by the US Department of Justice. \n\nThe costs \n\nSo far, News International/News UK has settled 718 claims for compensation for hacking  with the pay-outs plus legal costs topping $400m. Those pay-outs represent less than 15% of the suspected 5,500 victims of hacking. Scotland Yard has traced and alerted 3,500 of them and any of these people could apply to the formal compensation scheme the company is running to avoid more costly court action. \n\nHacking costs to News Corp\n\nApproximately 30 damages claims - as yet unproven - are also being prepared against Mirror Group Newspapers, including claims by football manager Sven Goran Erikson and David and Victoria Beckham's former nanny. \n\nThe police investigations have so far cost \u00a333m - and Scotland Yard said it had required an\"unprecedented level of resources\"to sift the evidence.\"The scale of the material that needed to be searched included millions of emails, tens of thousands of documents, complex communications data and trails of financial transactions that required painstaking analysis as evidence gradually emerged,\"it said. \n\nThe entire affair has cost Rupert Murdoch's News Corp more than \u00a3500m - including settlements, legal fees, loss of profits from closing the News of the World and a huge sum on restructuring the business to deal with the crisis. Those costs will rise further. \n\nThe hacking trial has cost the Crown Prosecution Service a further \u00a31.7m - most of that obviously relating to fees for a large team of barristers.\nTL;DR: What happens now? The conviction of Andy Coulson - and acquittal of Rebekah Brooks and others - is by no means the end of the road for the investigations into criminality - actual or alleged - inside newspapers.\n\nArticle: The\"foulards rouges\"are demanding an end to the violence witnessed at yellow-vest (gilets jaunes) rallies.\n\nThe gilets jaunes movement grew out of fuel tax protests in November.\n\nIt now embraces wider discontent with President Emmanuel Macron and has seen some of the most serious street violence in Paris since 1968.\n\nBut the weeks of TV footage showing clashes with riot police and damage to public monuments have triggered a counter-movement. The red scarves now have about 21,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nMore than 10,000 people took part in Sunday's march, Le Figaro reported.\n\n\"People are tired of the roadblocks. They are bad for business, and children are prevented from getting to school on time,\"red scarves spokesman Alex Brun told French broadcaster RFI.\n\nAhead of Sunday's rally in Paris, the red scarves put out a joint statement with similar-minded groups.\n\n\"We denounce the insurrectional climate installed by the yellow vests. We also reject the threats and constant verbal abuse (aimed at non-yellow vests),\"they announced in a joint manifesto. \n\nHowever, according to French media, a split has already emerged among the red scarves over whether or not to show support for President Macron.\n\nOne of the organisers of Sunday's march, Laurent Souli\u00e9, has rallied supporters on Facebook to back the president, RFI reported.\n\nMr Brun, on the other hand, said the\"foulards rouges\"were\"an apolitical citizens' movement\". He said the best way to resolve problems caused by the yellow vests was to take part in Mr Macron's\"Grand Debate\"rather than confronting protesters on the street.\n\nSome red-scarf leaders had urged members not to attend Sunday's rally.\n\nThe Grand Debate involves town-hall meetings nationwide to address protesters' concerns.\n\nAcross France, about 69,000 people took part in the 11th consecutive weekend of yellow-vest protests the interior ministry said.

but grappling with a pandemic means many of those pledges haven't progressed. \n\nBBC News NI assesses what has changed - and what hasn't - since devolution was restored.\n\nHealth\n\nThe deal came as health workers in Northern Ireland stood on picket lines demanding an end to an ongoing pay dispute and improved staffing levels.\n\nOne year on, with the health service on the frontline against Covid-19, pay has increased and the number of nursing students in Northern Ireland has also risen.\n\nThe deal included a commitment of an additional 900 places over three years.\n\nIn May, Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed funding would secure an extra 300 nursing and midwifery undergraduate places in 2020/21.\n\nThere has also been progress on a mental health action plan, published by the department in May and an interim mental health champion, Prof Siobhan O'Neill, was appointed in June.\n\nArguably the commitments regarding reform of the health service and action to reduce waiting lists have seen the least progress, with efforts still roundly focused on tackling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccination programme.\n\nThe executive's pledge to fund three cycles of IVF treatment remains outstanding, but Mr Swann said he would consider using the independent sector in order to provide more capacity for the extra treatments. \n\nLanguage and tradition\n\nOne of the key areas the parties disagreed on during the talks was over demands for a stand-alone Irish language act.\n\nNew Decade, New Approach committed the parties to establishing an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression, which would put in place provision for services in Irish and Ulster-Scots - but progress remains limited.\n\nThrough the office, new Irish and Ulster-Scots commissioners to enhance and develop the languages were to be appointed as well, but these processes have yet to take place.\n\nLast year, the Executive Office estimated that the bodies would be allocated about \u00a328m until 2022/23 but there remains no detail about how that funding will be broken down. \n\nThe Executive Office said\"preparatory work\"was ongoing to legislate for the core elements of the proposals.\n\n\"Legislation will be progressed as quickly as possible and the appointments of the director and commissioners will follow,\"it added.\n\nIt described the figure of \u00a328m as an\"early marker bid\"and actual costs would depend on decisions taken by the executive and assembly.\n\nEducation\n\nThe pandemic meant schools had to close for part of last year - but some areas still saw progress.\n\nA pay deal brought to an end the dispute with teaching unions over salary and workloads, but finding a way of resourcing school budgets sustainably still has yet to be delivered.\n\nOther commitments requiring action include a new special education needs framework.\n\nHowever, a long-standing pledge in the deal to open medical school in Londonderry saw the executive confirm funding in July, with recruitment for students beginning the following month.\n\nThe intention is to allow 70 graduate students to begin a four-year medical degree course this September.\n\nAccountability and transparency\n\nOne aim of New Decade, New Approach was to provide the parties with a basis to alter how Stormont operated day-to-day, after the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) public inquiry exposed failings in the system.\n\nSome of these proposals have made progress including the establishment of the Party Leaders' Forum, to\"improve collaboration and partnership\"between the executive parties on a monthly basis.\n\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy also published a strengthened code of conduct for special advisers (Spads) and further capped salaries available to Spads.\n\nHowever, similar proposals to improve the accountability of Stormont ministers have not been implemented.\n\nThe deal included a commitment to create three commissioners for ministerial standards to be appointed by the first and deputy first ministers.\n\nTraditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister has argued that the reforms do not go far enough, and is currently taking a private member's bill through the assembly that would legally tighten the rules on Spads.\n\nThe parties agreed to return to the executive on the basis of\"good faith, mutual respect and trust\"but events of the past year have both tested that pledge and led to accusations that a new approach is nowhere to be seen.\n\nFormer NI Secretary Julian Smith, who helped broker the deal, said his\"biggest concern\"was that a breakdown in trust would lead to more delay in taking important decisions before the assembly mandate ends next year.\n\nPolicing and legacy\n\nThe deal committed to increase police numbers in Northern Ireland to 7,500, a proposal first suggested as part of police reforms two decades ago and reaffirmed in New Decade, New Approach.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) currently has 6,900 officers.\n\nThe cost of 600 extra officers has been put at about \u00a340m a year, but some have questioned the affordability of the move and discussions have been continuing between the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and Department of Justice.\n\nBut wider plans to deal with the past remain a much harder conversation for the parties and governments.\n\nThe deal included a commitment by the British government to introduce legislation at Westminster within\"100 days\"to implement a legacy deal struck five years ago.\n\nIt included a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to look into Troubles killings.\n\nJust two months later, the government announced new plans that were a significant departure from the initial agreement - although these also have yet to be progressed through Parliament as the move divided the Stormont parties and angered some victims' groups.\n\nThe pledge by the British government to appoint Northern Ireland's first Veterans Commissioner was followed through in August, when former Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan took on the role.\n\nClimate change and environment\n\nFor years, Northern Ireland has been the only devolved administration without its own climate change legislation and targets for emissions cuts, though it does contribute to a wider UK target.\n\nNew Decade New Approach contained a number of pledges to tackle this.\n\nIt committed the parties to developing a climate change strategy and establishing an independent environmental protection agency, but they are still works in progress.\n\nAt the end of last year, the environment minister launched a public consultation on new climate change laws, ahead of bringing any legislation to the assembly.\n\nOther pledges \n\nThe deal included a range of outstanding issues for the parties to take action on, given the assembly had been stalled for three years - these were to be covered under a programme for government to be drawn up by the executive.\n\nHowever attention quickly turned to managing coronavirus which meant the target of three months to publish a\"comprehensive timetable\"for developing strategies such as anti-poverty, racial equality and childcare was missed.\n\nThe Department of Finance still has yet to set up an independent fiscal council for Northern Ireland, which would assess the sustainability of the executive's public finances. \n\nThe deal set a timeframe of July for this - but proposals have yet to be brought to the executive.\n\nAn ad-hoc assembly committee was set up to consider the creation of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland - that's currently out for public consultation.\n\nThe executive also issued the first payments to victims of Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA), opening the redress scheme in March after legislation passed by Westminster in 2019. \n\nHowever other recommendations from the inquiry, including a state apology for victims and survivors, have yet to be implemented.\nTL;DR: On 11 January 2020, the main political parties in Northern Ireland returned to power-sharing after three years of deadlock.\n\nArticle: The health ministry said data showed that more people had been discharged than new infections recorded.\n\nIndia has recorded a total of 276,583 infections, the fifth-highest number in the world. But with 8,102 deaths, it has a relatively low fatality rate.\n\nThe news is being cautiously welcomed in local media, but it comes amid concerns that picture is more bleak.\n\nA significant spike in infections in recent weeks has begun taking a toll on the healthcare system - and though India has ramped up testing, it is not uniform across the country, with some states testing much more than others.\n\nFor instance, the southern state of Tamil Nadu is testing more than 18,000 people per million, while the worst-affected state, Maharashtra, is only testing 4,688 per million. The national average is around 680 per million.\n\nInfections have been steadily climbing in the financial capital, Mumbai, and in the capital, Delhi, where officials have said that confirmed cases could top half a million by the end of July. \n\nThis has put a huge load on hospitals, with many alleging that patients with Covid-like symptoms are being turned away from private institutes due to a lack of space. \n\nThe issue is being compounded by the fact that not many people are willing to go to state hospitals despite them having some beds free. \n\nBoth Delhi and Mumbai are trying to free up more beds in private and state-run hospitals, but have warned people to take precautions and stay home as much as possible. \n\nMeanwhile, officials in the southern city of Chennai (formerly Madras) have launched an inquiry after it emerged that its death toll was underreported.\n\nA\"preliminary\"survey of the city's records have shown that at least 200 deaths have not been reflected in official data, although authorities say they do not believe the discrepancy is intentional.\nTL;DR: India says the number of total recoveries has outstripped active Covid infections for the first time.\n\nArticle: Brian TaylorPolitical editor, Scotland\n\nHowever, I was drawn by the reaction of the Kirk to this remarkable election.\n\nThe Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of the Church and Society, advocated\"prayerful reflection\"as a response to the uncertainty provoked by the events overnight.\n\nBoth Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon are now set to embark upon a period of introspection, from different motivations.\n\nI am unable to report whether prayer will be involved.\n\nBut their contemplation will be intense.\n\nMrs May, the vicar's daughter, will undoubtedly be pondering Macmillan-style events.  Her motivations for calling an early election were several and varied, mostly driven by partisan advantage.  \n\nThe notion of\"strengthening her hand\"in Brexit negotiations never seemed particularly credible to me.\n\nWere we really to believe that the other 27 EU nations would sideline their own national interests just because Mrs May won a bigger majority in the Commons? \n\nNevertheless, that was advanced as an objective. More, Mrs May envisaged a substantial Commons majority giving her a personal mandate and an opportunity to get her policies, Brexit included, past a potentially sceptical House.\n\nIn truth, she expected and anticipated a landslide over Jeremy Corbyn, who was supposed to play the role of pantomime villain, to be hissed and treated with contumely.\n\nShe has now failed in all three aims.\n\nOpen disbelief\n\nNot a single one has been achieved. From a standing start, in a self-imposed political contest, that is a simply stunning clean sweep.\n\nIn coping with this self-generated crisis, Mrs May said the nation needed\"certainty\".\n\nThat sound you heard in the distance was Tories guffawing in open disbelief.  \n\nDoes she really think, you can also hear them muttering, that she can get away with replaying a record, a single track from a failed campaign?\n\nSeldom has a political manoeuvre backfired so spectacularly.\n\nLet us not forget. Theresa May has thrown away a working Commons majority and is now dependent on Ulster's DUP, if she is to survive at all.\n\nA few home thoughts too for Nicola Sturgeon.  She promises to reflect upon the election - including the role which the prospect of indyref2 played in those lost SNP votes.\n\nYes, the SNP won the election in Scotland.  Arithmetic and every Nationalist will tell us so.\n\nPrime focus\n\nBut they lost votes, they lost 21 seats and they markedly lost momentum. \n\nAides say Ms Sturgeon is genuinely considering options, authentically rethinking - while urging others in Scotland to do the same. \n\nIn the immediate term, she is demanding a role in Brexit negotiations which she says must now be rescheduled and repeating her offer to oust Mrs May, if the parliamentary votes can be found.  Those issues are the prime focus. \n\nBut what about indyref2? She will certainly not abandon the aim of independence - nor the calculation that it would be brought about via a referendum.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view our results map\n\nI also think it unlikely that she will formally renounce the proposed timetable for indyref2 - which is at the end of the Brexit process.\n\nPerhaps, rather, she might seek to clarify the detail of that timetable.  \n\nIn practice, though, indyref2 is hobbled.  It may not be\"dead\", as Ruth Davidson declared. But it is certainly ailing. \n\nMomentum is not with the SNP.  It is with the advocates of Union - Labour, the Liberal Democrats and especially the Tories, who all made significant gains.  \n\nFor Labour, the result is a huge relief.  Many inside the party thought Jeremy Corbyn a loser in advance, Kezia Dugdale being among them.\n\nUpbeat and victorious\n\nNow they are on the rise. Although, never forget, they did not win, either in Scotland or across the UK. \n\nThe Liberal Democrats also recorded gains, winning seats where they were identified as the core contenders for toppling the SNP. \n\nAnd for the Tories, the spoils of victory in Scotland. Soured a little by the UK outcome - or, perhaps perversely, sweetened in contrast. \n\nAfter years of apology, Uriah Heep style, they are upbeat and victorious.  \n\nTruly, a remarkable night.\nTL;DR: Despite briefly studying theology at university, it is not often these days, in truth, that I contemplate the divine.\n\nArticle: Tommy Ferris, 28, from London, was found fatally injured off Smannell Road, Andover in Hampshire, at about 01:00 BST on 13 April.\n\nZandrae Smith, 21, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had denied murder, claiming he killed Mr Ferris in self-defence.\n\nHe was found guilty and ordered to serve at least 22 years in prison.\n\nThe trial at Winchester Crown Court was told drug users in the alleyway had heard Mr Ferris warn Smith not to deal drugs on his patch.\n\nAfter being robbed of money, drugs and his mobile phone, Smith initially walked away before running back to Mr Ferris and attacking him.\n\nHe died from four stab wounds to the upper body, including an 18cm-deep cut which pierced his lung.\n\nSimon Jones, prosecuting, said the attack was one of revenge and not self-defence.\n\nThe trial earlier heard how Smith tried to retrieve his stolen items from Mr Ferris's body while a police officer was performing CPR.\n\nThe defendant, of Octavia Court, was arrested three days later in Bradford and repeatedly answered\"no comment\"during two days of police interviews, the jury was told.\n\nAli Naseem Bajwa QC, defending, said there was no dispute that Smith had fatally stabbed Mr Ferris after being robbed at knifepoint, but claimed he had done so in self-defence.\nTL;DR: A drug dealer has been jailed for life for stabbing to death a rival who had just robbed him in an alleyway.\n\nArticle: Her comments came as a new study showed the carbon footprint of the NHS in Wales was 7% smaller in 2009, compared with 2005.\n\nThe study looked at energy use in buildings, emissions related to patient and staff travel, and emissions related to goods and services used.\n\nThe assembly government target is a 3% reduction year-on-year in emissions.\n\nMrs Hart said that while the figures show the assembly was\"tackling climate change\"in the NHS, more could be achieved.\n\n\"While we have done a great deal, we know we must do more,\"said Mrs Hart, speaking at the start of Climate Change Week.\n\n\"I am pleased about the 7% reduction in the carbon footprint of the NHS in Wales since 2005, but we need to go further, to contribute to the assembly government's target of a 3% reduction year-on-year in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Being more energy efficient is not only good for the environment, but also helps to reduce costs and save money.\"\n\nTravel and transport\n\nThe emissions related to the production of goods and services used by the NHS accounted for 38% of the total, with 34% coming from building energy use and 28% from travel and transport. \n\nNatural gas consumption accounted for the largest individual contribution to the carbon footprint - at 21% or 117,000 tonnes - followed by patients' travel at 12% or 96,000 tonnes, and electricity consumption at 11% or 91,000 tonnes.\n\nHowever, a separate annual report from Welsh Health Estates shows that for 2009-10 shows the total amount of electricity generated by combined heating and power units rose from 8.86% of total electricity requirements in 2008-9 to 15.7 % in 2009-10. \n\nThis was mainly due to the commissioning of new and larger capacity systems during the year. \n\nThere was also a 21% improvement in NHS energy efficiency since 1999-2000, with 4% less waste being sent to landfill in 2009-10 compared with 2008-09 which is a reduction of 14.5% below 1999-2000 base year.\n\nA \u00a33m assembly government fund has supported 123 NHS schemes, including installation of low energy external LED lighting and movement sensors.\nTL;DR: Health Minister Edwina Hart says more can be done in the Welsh NHS to cut emissions and raise energy efficiency.\n\nArticle: Five teenagers were taken to hospital and others injured on Saturday evening when the wave dragged them under the water, throwing them against rocks.\n\nGuernsey's harbourmaster said a report had been requested from Condor Ferries who had\"vessels in the vicinity\".\n\nThe company said it was treating the matter\"extremely seriously\".\n\nFor more on the wave, and other stories from across the Channel Islands.\n\nWitnesses to what happened at about 18:00 BST described the swell as a\"colossal wave\"throwing people at the pools against railings in a\"split second\".\n\nConcern has been raised by the public over safety at the pools and the speed at which boats pass by.\n\nHelen King, whose daughter was at the pool, said:\"I knew that there would be a swell and sometimes you do get a big wave, but why aren't there lifeguards there?\n\n\"Or some kind of siren to warn the children?

Freight companies are also acknowledging the cost advantages that will come from running robot ships.\n\nBut\"over-the-horizon\"control has to show it's practical and safe if it's to gain wide acceptance. Hence, the demonstration from Maxlimer. \n\nThe USV was despatched from Plymouth in late July and sent to a location some 460km (280 miles) to the south-west.\n\nWith a multi-beam echo-sounder attached to its hull, the boat mapped more than 1,000sq km of continental shelf area, down to about a kilometre in depth.\n\nThis was a segment of seafloor that had essentially no modern data registered with the UK Hydrographic Office.\n\nSEA-KIT had wanted to send the USV across the Atlantic to America for the demonstration, but the Covid-19 crisis made this impossible to organise.\n\n\"The project's overall aim was to demonstrate the capabilities of current technologies to survey unexplored or inadequately surveyed ocean frontiers and despite the planning challenges we faced due to Covid-19, I feel that we have done that. We have proven the true over-the-horizon capability of our USV design and the team are exhausted but elated,\"the company's director of technology, Peter Walker, said.\n\nThe USV Maxlimer was originally developed for - and won - the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE.\n\nThis was a competition to find the next-generation technologies that could be used to map the global ocean floor. Four-fifths of the sea bottom have yet to be surveyed to an acceptable resolution. Robotic solutions will be essential if we're to have any chance of closing the knowledge gap.\n\nMaxlimer makes use of a communications and control system known as Global Situational Awareness via Internet.\n\nThis allows an operator to remotely access CCTV footage, thermal imaging and radar through the vessel, as well as listen live to the USV's surroundings and even communicate with others in the vicinity.\n\nMaxlimer links to three independent satellite systems to stay in contact with the control room in Tollesbury.\n\nThe robot boat moves slowly, at up to 4 knots (7km/h; 5mph), but its hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system is highly efficient.\n\nSEA-KIT CEO and designer, Ben Simpson, told BBC News:\"We had a sweepstake on how much fuel would be left in the tank. We thought there was going to be 300-400 litres. It turned out there was 1,300 litres.\"In other words, Maxlimer returned to Plymouth with its fuel tank still around a third full.\n\nAs well as the European Space Agency, partners on the project included Global Marine Group, Map the Gaps, Teledyne CARIS, Woods Hole Group and the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. \n\nAnother partner was Fugro, one of the world's biggest marine geotechnical companies. The multinational recently announced a contract with SEA-KIT to purchase a fleet of USVs to use in survey work in the oil, gas and offshore wind sectors. \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: A UK boat has just provided an impressive demonstration of the future of robotic maritime operations.\n\nArticle: By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nSir Philip Green's retail empire - which owns Topshop, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge, and Wallis - is reportedly seeking a rescue deal that would allow it to cut rents and close stores.\n\nIt would be a big fall from grace for a business that not long ago was talking about cracking the US and China, and a blow for Sir Philip, who made his fortune in fashion retail. \n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nWhat is the history of Arcadia?\n\nThe Arcadia Group's origins date back to 1903 and the formation of the Burton menswear chain, which grew to acquire brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, and renamed itself Arcadia in 1998. \n\nIn 2002 Taveta Investments, owned by the Green family, bought Arcadia and delisted it from the stock exchange. Sir Philip, who had bought the now defunct BHS department store chain for \u00a3200m in 2000, installed himself as chief executive. \n\nThe entrepreneur swiftly set about\"cutting the fat\"out of the group, offloading failing brands and cutting jobs, says retail analyst Richard Hyman. \n\n\"He very successfully reduced the cost base, making brands like Dorothy Perkins more profitable. He is famous for running a no frills operation.\"\n\nWhat was behind the rise of the fashion empire?\n\nThe group seemed to be doing well, particularly the jewel in its crown, Topshop, which became known as a trend setter and attracted celebrity endorsements. \n\nKate Moss has twice worked with Sir Philip on Topshop lines, while Cara Delevingne, the model-turned-actress, became the face of the brand in 2014.\n\nSir Philip, who is reported to be worth almost \u00a34bn, also appeared to be doing well from his acquisition. \n\nIn recent years, he has been snapped partying with everyone from Bill Clinton to Simon Cowell, and reportedly spent \u00a320m on his 55th birthday party in the Maldives.\n\nHowever, Mr Hyman believes that behind the scenes, all was not well at Arcadia. \n\n\"Arcadia for many years has been a business with one very good brand - Topshop - and others that are somewhat past their best. \n\n\"In a growth market it is easy to paper over the cracks, and there was a growth market from the mid 90s up until the financial crisis in 2008.\"\n\nWhere are we now?\n\nToday Arcadia has 1,170 shops in 36 countries, although the majority are concessions or franchises. \n\nIt has also shut 200 of its UK stores over the past three years, and may be set to close more as it struggles with a challenging market. \n\nThe group now faces intense competition from a crop of more contemporary\"fast fashion\"retailers ranging from High Street behemoths like Zara and H&M to pure online players like Asos.\n\nIt's also faced the same problems as other High Street retailers, including rising business rates and labour costs, too many unprofitable stores, and inflexible leases that make it hard to close failing shops. \n\n\"We've had 10 years of austerity, people don't spend like they used to, and we're massively over shopped,\"believes Eric Musgrave, a fashion commentator and former editorial director of Drapers magazine.\n\n\"The speed at which the market is changing, and the number of new fashion rivals, has basically overwhelmed them.\"\n\nRichard Lim, an analyst at Retail Economics, says the rise of online shopping's been a big factor too.\"Not only are retailers facing fixed costs they face huge costs fulfilling online orders. That's a lot easier to handle if you are a smaller, nimbler operator.\"\n\nWas Green to blame? \n\nSome say that Sir Philip, who is reported to have run Arcadia with an iron fist, has been too slow to change.\n\nLord Stuart Rose, a former boss of M&S and retail rival, told the Financial Times in 2015:\"He's more of a yesterday's man than he is a tomorrow's man... Time has caught him up.\"\n\nIt is also unclear whether a spate of personal scandals has damaged the group's performance. \n\nThe tycoon received widespread criticism - and calls to strip his knighthood - after he sold BHS for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell in 2015.\n\nMPs accused him of stripping money out of the firm before the sale, leaving it with a pensions deficit of \u00a3571m, which Sir Philip eventually paid \u00a3363m into.\n\nMore recently Arcadia faced a consumer backlash after Sir Philip faced allegations of sexual harassment - claims he strongly denies. \n\nWhat next?\n\nReports suggest Arcadia will seek a Company Voluntary Arrangement  (CVA) - a solution that would enable it to avoid going bust by closing stores and cutting rents. \n\nHowever, while this has worked for other struggling retailers such as Byron Burger and New Look, some question whether landlords will be prepared to grant Sir Philip concessions given his reported personal wealth. \n\nThe tycoon could also seek to sell the business, but some say prospective buyers could be put off by its large pension liabilities. \n\nThe ailing retailer has two final salary plans with a combined deficit in 2018 of \u00a3537m.\nTL;DR: Arcadia Group has long dominated the British High Street, but are its glory days coming to an end?\n\nArticle: In June 2003, operators Bond warned Eurocopter about a fuel tank water contamination concern with the EC135.\n\nBut a fatal accident inquiry heard a service bulletin, designed to alert all operators of the aircraft, was not circulated until April 2014. \n\nTen people died in the tragedy in Glasgow city centre in November 2013.  \n\nDavid Price, director of engineering for Bond at the time of the crash, told the court he highlighted the issue, which related to a seal which sucked water into the fuel system. \n\nIn an email response, the manufacturers said:\"A solution has to be found.\"\n\nBut in March 2005, Mr Price sent another email about the seal. \n\nHe wrote:\"I am somewhat concerned that what was, and still is, a flight safety issue has not been prioritised in the manner I feel it should have and the manner we have come to expect.\"\n\nThe court, which is sitting at Hampden Park, heard Bond engineers corrected the problem at the time by disconnecting a drain line. \n\nBut Mr Price's email concluded there was a\"world wide fleet issue\"that needed to be addressed.\n\nThe witness was assured by Eurocopter - now known as Airbus - that a service bulletin had been delayed but one would be issued as soon as possible. \n\nDespite the email exchange a service bulletin about the matter was not issued until April 2014. \n\nIt ordered a new part to be be fitted.\n\nMr Price said this was implemented across Bond's fleet within a month. \n\nThe witness also told the court the modification stopped the original problem. \n\nThe court had previously heard that no evidence of water contamination was found in the fuel tanks of the Police Scotland helicopter after the crash. \n\nClutha inquiry: The evidence so far\n\nThe inquiry began last month with a minute's silence to honour the victims of the tragedy.\n\nOn the third day, a joint minute was read out which agreed the times and causes of death.\n\nPilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives in the crash along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street.\n\nThey were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44.\n\nThe inquiry, before Sheriff principal Craig Turnbull, continues.\nTL;DR: The manufacturers of the police helicopter that crashed into the Clutha pub took more than a decade to issue a global safety notice.\n\nArticle: There were 417 call-outs from 46 RNLI stations around Scotland between 1 June and 31 August, up 4% on the same period last year.\n\nThe charity said it was a busy summer for its crews, with sunny weather on the west coast meaning a rise in activity.\n\nTroon was the busiest station with 25 call-outs, three more than last summer.\n\nThe busiest inshore station was Queensferry where volunteers launched 21 times over the three months.\n\nThere were significant increases in call-outs from RNLI stations in Largs, Mallaig, Tobermory and Campbeltown which are all on the west coast.\n\nLaunches from Tobermory on Mull jumped from just two last summer to 15 this year.\n\nIn Kintyre, Campbeltown's total doubled from seven to 14, call-outs from RNLI Mallaig in Lochaber increased by six, from 11 to 17 and call-outs at RNLI Largs in Ayrshire rose from 13 to 18.\n\nThe charity's newest lifeboat station, at Leverburgh on Harris, had seven call-outs.\n\nStations in the far north of Scotland, at Wick, Thurso, Orkney and Shetland, were all quieter than last year.\n\nPaul Jennings, RNLI divisional inspector for Scotland, said:\"Once again our volunteer lifeboat crews in Scotland have shown that they are committed and courageous individuals, on stand-by to save lives at sea come rain or shine.\n\n\"Behind the crews are a huge team of volunteers, the station management volunteers, shore helpers and fundraisers, to whom we owe our thanks for ensuring that the RNLI can keep on saving lives at sea.\"\nTL;DR: More lifeboats were launched in Scottish waters over the summer months, new figures show.\n\nArticle: In 1991, the Children of the 90s Project recruited 14,500 pregnant women to chart their health and that of their children.\n\nProf Nic Timpson said the team wants to understand how the virus spreads from infected people who have no symptoms.\n\nThe Bristol-based project also aims to record the impact of staying at home on people's finances, fitness and health.\n\n'Subtle ways'\n\n\"It is important is to understand how it travels through the population -

the years of extreme austerity and blackouts.\n\nThat time - known as the Special Period - followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, a key donor of the Communist-run island.\n\nIn May, Cuba announced rationing of more products amid shortages it blamed on the US trade embargo and hoarders..\n\nIn 2017, US President Donald Trump reimposed some trade and travel restrictions lifted by his predecessor Barack Obama, although he kept the embassy open in Havana and did not end flights to the country.\n\nWhat did Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel say?\n\nIn an unexpected appearance on television on Wednesday, the Cuban president warned the government must implement emergency measures to stave off an acute fuel shortage.\n\nBut he admitted that\"there may be tense situations in the distribution of some products and the provision of services to the population in the coming days\".\n\nSpecifically, he guaranteed that there would be no blackouts before Sunday -

Using computer algorithms, the scientists transformed the electrical signals they emitted into an impulse that sensory nerves could interpret.    \n\nDuring an operation in Rome, four electrodes were implanted onto nerves in the patient's upper arm.   These were connected to the artificial sensors in the fingers of the prosthetic hand, so allowing touch and pressure feedback to be sent direct to the brain.\n\nMr Aabo, 36, a property developer, spent a month doing laboratory tests, firstly to check the electrodes were functioning, and then with these fully connected to the bionic hand.    \n\nHe said:\"The biggest difference was when I grabbed something I could feel what I was doing without having to look.  I could use the hand in the dark.  \n\n\"It was intuitive to use, and incredible to be able to feel whether objects were soft or hard, square or round.\"\n\nHero\n\nThe bionic hand is still a prototype, and due to safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials, Mr Aabo required a second operation to remove the sensors. \n\n\"He is a hero,\" said Professor Paolo Rossini, neurologist, University Hospital Agostino Gemelli, Rome.\n\n\"He gave a month of his life and had two operations to test this device.\n\n\"We are all very grateful to him.\"\n\nProf Rossini said a lot of pre-training was done involving surgery on pigs, and with human cadavers, to ensure they knew exactly how to attach electrodes to the tiny peripheral nerves in the upper arm.  \n\nAnother member of the team, Dr Stanisa Raspopovic said: \"It was a very exciting moment when after endless hours of testing....Dennis turned to us and said with disbelief,'This is magic! I can feel the closing of my missing hand!'\"\n\nThose working in the field in the UK were also enthusiastic.\n\n\"This is very interesting work, taking research in upper limb prosthetics into the next stage by adding sensory feedback,  said Dr Alastair Ritchie, Lecturer in Biomaterials and Bioengineering, University of Nottingham.\n\n\"This technology would enable the user to know how firmly they are gripping an object, which is vital for handling fragile objects - imagine picking up an egg without any feeling in your fingers.\"\n\nThe international team is now working on how to miniaturise the technology so that it could be used in the home.\n\n\"We must get rid of the external cables and make them fully implantable\"said Prof Thomas Stieglitz, University of Frieburg, Germany, whose laboratory created the ultra-thin implantable electrodes.\n\nRecently, scientists in Cleveland, Ohio released a video of a patient using the fingers of a prosthetic hand to pull the stalks from cherries while blindfolded.  But the research has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n\nThere is no precise timetable, but scientists think it could be a decade before a sensory feedback bionic hand is commercially available.  \n\nAnd they believe it may pave the way for more realistic prosthetic devices in the future which can detect texture and temperature.   \n\n'Bring it on'\n\nBut it will undoubtedly be very expensive, well beyond the means of most patients.  And artificial hands still lack the precision and dexterity of the real thing. \n\nThe super-functioning bionic hand of science fiction films remains the stuff of fiction.  \n\nNonetheless, Dennis Aabo, who now has his old prosthesis back,  is ready to swap it for the bionic hand in any future trial. \n\n\"If they offer it to me, I will say bring it on, I'm ready.\"\nTL;DR: Scientists have created a bionic hand which allows the amputee to feel lifelike sensations from their fingers.\n\nArticle: By Angie BrownBBC Scotland News\n\nRubbish had built up over decades along the grassy verges and laybys of the A70 from Edinburgh to Ayr, which is known locally as the Lang Whang.  \n\nSo the 52-year-old started arming himself with a litter picker when he left his home in Kirknewton, West Lothian, for his daily exercise. \n\nHe said:\"Often when you have an outsider's view you have a different perspective and it was obvious to me immediately how much litter there was blighting this beautiful part of the countryside.\n\n\"Under the lockdown I could litter pick in a socially distancing way without breaking any rules.\"\n\nThe management consultant - who had lived in Seattle for 20 years - was soon joined in the clean-up by his wife Teresa.\n\nLocal support then started to grow, so they named themselves the Lang Whang Wombles and started up a Facebook page to seek more help.\n\n\"The idea is to create a self-sustaining structure once we have cleared the road, where people opt in and take ownership of the litter,\"he said.  \n\nPart of the route has been divided up into 300m zones where local residents can clear their own area.\n\nPaul, an Agile coach, has made signs along the route in a bid to encourage others to get involved.\n\nHe said:\"Litter picking can get really addictive.

Did you read them all first time round?\n\nJanuary: Sued over'shrinking' storage'\n\nIt was a troubled start to the year for the world's highest-valued tech firm.\n\nApple was sued by two Americans who claimed that the latest version of its mobile operating system was so large that iPhones and iPads had less spare space for users' own data than had been advertised - a particular problem, they said, for bottom-of-the-range devices.\n\nAs a result, the plaintiffs alleged, device owners had to subscribe to the firm's fee-based iCloud storage system.\n\nApple sought to have the case dismissed, but it is still rattling around the US legal system with the most recent papers filed by both sides in November.\n\nFebruary: Eavesdropping TVs\n\nSamsung raised more than a few eyebrows when documentation for its smart TVs warned owners that they might transmit\"personal or other sensitive information\"spoken in front of them to a unnamed\"third party\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, many found the idea of the TVs spying on their private conversations more than a little unnerving.\n\nThe firm attempted to allay concerns by making it clear that it was only referring to speech captured by its TV remotes, and not its screens, and that the third-party in question was the voice recognition tech provider Nuance.\n\nBut those efforts were somewhat undone when it was later revealed that the voice uploads were being transmitted in an unencrypted form, potentially making it easier for hackers to listen in.\n\nMarch: Anticipating the Apple Watch\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that the experts were debating whether Apple's wearable tech would be it's next\"game-changing\"product.\n\nBack in March, there was speculation users would switch their attention away from their smartphone screens and focus more on their wrists. News that Apple was going to price its top-end models at $17,000 (\u00a311,500) without the possibility of an upgrade caused some company-watchers to wince.\n\nAs it turned out, the device appears to have sold in respectable numbers - better than any other smartwatch on the market, but significantly less than the firm's other flagship products, if analysts estimates are to be believed.\n\nThe jury's still out on the smartwatch category as a whole, but that hasn't prevented speculation about what features the Apple Watch 2 might include spreading in recent weeks.\n\nApril: Grounded by an app\n\nAmerican Airlines' efforts to make its cockpits\"paperless\"briefly backfired when the app providing its pilots with maps and other flight information refused to work.\n\nDozens of the firm's jets were grounded until the developers of FliteDeck came up with a fix.\n\nIt wasn't the only software fault to cause problems for the industry.\n\nIn both June and July, United had to ground flights because of other IT setbacks, and then in August a fault with the Federal Aviation Administration's systems caused hundreds more planes to take off late.\n\nMay: Battery-powered homes\n\nElon Musk is still best known for his electric cars, space rockets and warnings about artificial intelligence.\n\nBut if he gets his way, the most common way some of us will come into contact with his tech will be plugging a device into one of our plug sockets.\n\nThe entrepreneur announced in May that he plans to sell large lithium-ion batteries that store solar power-generated energy in order to provide an eco-friendlier way to power our homes.\n\nMr Musk suggested the Tesla Powerwall would help change the\"entire energy infrastructure of the world\". \n\nBut the batteries are not cheap. We'll get a better idea how they work when deliveries start next year.\n\nJune:'Baby yoga' backlash\n\nFacebook was criticised by a UK-based child protection charity after its moderators refused to remove a video showing a crying baby being repeatedly dunked in a bucket of water.\n\nThere were suggestions that the footage showed a form of\"baby yoga\". But the charity said the child was terrified and sobbing, and that the actions amounted to child abuse.\n\nThe case highlighted a clash of cultures between the social network, which wants to allow its users to post and comment about potentially distressing content, and those who think it has a responsibility to censor extreme examples.\n\nJuly: Reddit revolt\n\nIt's been a tough year for Reddit's ex-chief executive Ellen Pao.\n\nBack in March she lost a high-profile sexual discrimination case that she had brought against the Silicon Valley venture capital firm she had previously worked at.\n\nThen in June she faced a user-backlash when Reddit banned some of the more controversial topic threads on its social news site.\n\nBut it was not until July that matters came to a head when it emerged that one of the site's popular employees had been sacked.\n\nVolunteer moderators closed down large parts of the platform, which they controlled, in protest.\n\nA week later Ms Pao resigned. \n\nLater reports, however, suggested that Ms Pao had unfairly been blamed for the affair.\n\nAugust: Ashley Madison fallout\n\nEarlier in the year, the dating service for love-cheats had planned to cash in by floating on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nBut by August, it was fighting for its very existence after a data dump exposed details of more than 33 million of its users' accounts. \n\nThe hack caused the firm's founder to resign, but also had ramifications that reached far beyond the Canadian firm's offices.\n\nNews that police believed the leak had resulted in at least two suicides was the most read story on the BBC's Tech section this year, and highlighted the devastation the security breach had had on people's lives.\n\nBlackmailers continue to try to exploit the hack - whose perpetrator has never been caught - with a recent report of letters being posted to Ashley Madison users threatening to expose their identities.\n\nSeptember: Giant iPad\n\nOver recent years, Apple has organised two Autumn events to unveil its latest products. This year it packed all the news into one mammoth announcement.\n\nA new Apple TV set top box, a refreshed iPhone and new larger iPad Pro were all unveiled.\n\nBut the focus for many was the Apple Pencil. Critics made hay of the fact that when Steve Jobs was in charge, he had seemingly mocked the idea that Apple would make a stylus for one of its i-devices.\n\nBut when the reviews came in, the add-on was widely praised as a design tool.\n\nWhether or not it, and the larger tablet, will reverse a decline in iPad sales is still to be determined.\n\nOctober: Back to Back to the Future\n\nFew would rank the second Back to the Future film as the best in the series.\n\nBut such is the affection people hold for the trilogy that the date that Marty and Doc Brown travelled forward in time to - 21 October 2015 - proved to be a huge cultural phenomenon.\n\nWe picked through the movie to see what predictions it had got right and wrong when filmed in 1989.\n\nAnd, if you haven't already done so, it's worth seeing Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprise their roles for the Jimmy Kimmel show.\n\nNovember: Speed of light\n\nAs the European nights darkened, a Estonian start-up brought news that it had been able to use LED light bulbs to transmit data at speeds of one gigabits per second.\n\nIt wasn't the first time we'd reported about Li-fi - we first discussed the concept of transmitting data via the light shone from bulbs back in 2011.\n\nBut what made this significant was that the tech firm had got it working in a normal office, where it provided both light and internet access to staff.\n\nIn time, engineers believe they can boost speeds up to 224Gbps.\n\nDecember: AirBnB racism\n\nEnding the year on a somewhat downbeat note was evidence that people with African-American sounding names find it harder to book rooms on AirBnB than those with white-sounding ones.\n\nThe report was based on a survey of 6,000 hosts across five US cities carried out by researchers at Harvard University.\n\nAirBnB acknowledged that discrimination was an issue, but defended its policy of requiring travellers to use their real names to reserve rooms on the basis that this engendered trust between visitors and their hosts.\nTL;DR: Part of the fun in following the tech scene is that there's always so much new stuff to read about.\n\nArticle: Sir Keir Starmer said including another referendum in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill would\"break the impasse\".\n\nTalks between Labour and the government to find a compromise Brexit deal broke down on Friday without agreement.\n\nTheresa May has said she would consider putting different Brexit options to MPs to see which ones\"command a majority\".\n\nLabour's preferred plan is for changes to the government's Brexit deal or an election, but if neither of those are possible, it will support the option of a public vote.\n\nThere have been calls for giving the public another say on Brexit. One widely discussed option is for a\"confirmatory vote\"with the choice between accepting whatever deal the government agrees, or remaining in the EU. \n\nOthers argue any new referendum should include the option of leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Keir suggested the government should seek\"further changes to the political declaration\", which sets out the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. \n\nHe added:\"Or of course they could seek to break the impasse by putting a confirmatory vote on the face of a bill. \n\n\"But whatever happens they have to find a way of breaking the impasse. We've got five and a half months which seems like quite a long time but in reality, once we get to the summer recess, we've only got only two weeks in September and two weeks in October.\"\n\nBrexit had been due to take place on 29 March - but after MPs voted down the deal Mrs May had negotiated with the bloc three times, the EU gave the UK an extension until 31 October.\n\nMrs May announced this week that MPs will vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning 3 June.\n\nThis will be the second reading vote on the bill, which is the key piece of legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement - the legally binding part of the Brexit deal that covers exit terms - and take the UK out of the EU. \n\nThe second reading is the first opportunity for MPs to debate the bill. If it is not passed by Parliament, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October without a deal.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser\n\nYour guide to Brexit jargon\n\nUse the list below or select a button\n\nSir Keir said Labour would vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, accusing the government of attempting\"an experiment\"and bringing the UK to\"a cliff edge\". \n\n\"If that bill goes through second reading and then collapses at third reading we are then up against the cliff edge in October, which is why we've said we'll vote against that at second reading if there isn't an agreed deal before we start,\"he said. \n\nHe denied that would make a no-deal Brexit more likely.\"I don't accept that. What we can't do is keep on buying another week at a time which is what the prime minister has been doing for months.\"\n\nTalks'torpedoed'\n\nDiscussions between the Conservatives and Labour - to see if they could come to an agreement on Brexit despite differences over issues including membership of a customs union and a further referendum - lasted six weeks before ending on Friday.\n\nSir Keir blamed the collapse of talks with the government on the inability to\"future proof\"a deal against an\"incoming Tory leader\"and said although the two sides had conducted the talks\"in good faith\", they were\"a long way apart\"on substance.  \n\nHe said:\"During the talks, almost literally as we were sitting in the room talking, cabinet members and wannabe Tory leaders were torpedoing the talks with remarks about not being willing to accept the customs union.\n\n\"In terms of the team that we were negotiating with, I'm not blaming them. \n\n\"Circling around those that were in the room trying to negotiate were others who didn't want the negotiation to succeed because they had their eye on what was coming next.\"\n\nMrs May has previously blamed the collapse on the lack of a\"common position\"within Labour.\n\nIt comes as a poll of Conservative members for The Times suggest former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the favourite to succeed Mrs May.\n\nA YouGov poll commissioned by the Times suggests Mr Johnson is the first choice for 39% of those Tory party activists who responded.\n\nThe former London mayor, who announced his intention to run earlier this week, was three times as popular as the next closest choice, ex-Brexit secretary Dominic Raab (13%).\n\nOf the others, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Environment Secretary Michael Gove were both on 9%, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on 8% and Health Secretary Matt Hancock on 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph that Mrs May's successor as prime minister should not call a general election until Brexit is completed.\n\nHe said an early election risked losing to Labour and\"killing Brexit altogether\".\n\nHe added:\"We need to take responsibility for delivering on the referendum result.\"\nTL;DR: The government should add a public vote to the Brexit legislation which MPs will vote on next month, the shadow Brexit secretary has told the BBC.\n\nArticle: The un-named staff members worked at food supplier Cranswick, which is based in Wombwell, Barnsley.\n\nThey were part of the 1,200-strong workforce at the site\"maintaining vital supplies of fresh food into the supermarkets\", Cranswick said.\n\nIn a statement, the company said that health and safety of staff was its\"number one priority\".\n\nA company spokesman said their\"thoughts and condolences\"were with the workers' families, who were being provided with\"full support\".\n\nMore stories from across Yorkshire\n\nThe food supplier said that from the start of the pandemic it had implemented\"additional measures to protect both the physical and mental wellbeing\"of staff.\n\nThe statement said that\"additional cleaning and hygiene measures\"had been in place at the site.\n\nIt added:\"Cranswick employees are designated key workers and are at the forefront of maintaining vital supplies of fresh food into the supermarkets. \n\n\"We are doing everything we can to protect them while they carry out this critical role.\n\n\"All colleagues are also advised not to attend work if they have any symptoms.\" \n\nOn the company's website it says the site supplies fresh and cooked food products\"from farm to fork\".\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The prince had set about removing many senior officials seen as close to Prince Mohammed who had effectively run the ministry for his father Prince Nayef for several years.  That in itself was unsettling in a government department which is the largest and most important in the country.\n\n\"The people who lost their jobs were the modernisers,\"Mr Stephens adds.  And that would not have sat well with King Abdullah, who has very gradually moved this most strict and conservative of Gulf countries along a more open road.\n\nLegacy issue\n\nEqually there is growing concern that young Saudis are crossing the border to join the fight against the Assad regime in Syria.  \n\nKing Abdullah is highly mindful of the fact that jihadists who had gone to Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s had filtered back and created a homegrown militant network, using their military expertise to train a new generation who then went on to attack not just Westerners in the kingdom but the Saudi royal family itself.  \n\nA recreation of that jihadist scenario is something the royals cannot tolerate and Prince Ahmed was widely seen as not up to the task of coping with the challenge, nor with growing Shia dissent in the oil rich Eastern Province.\n\nBut perhaps the most intriguing aspect to emerge centres around the legacy that King Abdullah wishes to leave.\n\nAbdullah has moved to curb the power of hardline clerics by, amongst other things, limiting the fatwas they can issue.  \n\nHe ordered a reorganisation of the religious police, installing a moderate as chief in the wake of growing public resentment.  \n\nHe opened a coeducational university and has given women the right to vote, albeit in largely irrelevant municipal elections.  And he has pushed for  fiscal reform and  more meaningful economic diversification.\n\nBut the king is in his late 80s, with question marks surrounding his health, and his putative successor Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz is reportedly ailing.\n\nPowerful post\n\nThe Interior Ministry is by far the largest and most powerful in the country. \n\nMohsen Al Awajy, a Saudi cleric and lawyer with close ties to the Nayef family, says\"the ministry is the country, it is the government and the person who runs it is in the most sensitive position in the kingdom\".\n\nSo Prince Mohammed has been moved by the king into a dominant position on the chess board.  What makes the move remarkable in part is his age.  He is just 53\n\n\"King Abdullah is the first ruler to put qualifications and ability for the job ahead of age,\" says Mr Awajy.\n\nHe adds:\"There are some in the royal family who will not be happy but this is a move that is good for the country.  It opens a new channel for dialogue and change.\"\n\nIt also opens up the intriguing possibility that the next ruler of Saudi Arabia will jump a generation.  The possibility that Prince Mohammed would follow Abdullah is one that Washington would in all likelihood quietly favour.\n\n\"The Americans see him as a good operator. They like him,\" Michael Stephens says, adding:\"Mohammed bin Nayef would protect Abdullah's reforms and ensure that the gains are not undone.\"\n\nAmerica's quiet diplomacy in the Middle East and its push for a gradual transition to more open and accountable societies in a crucial region give Prince Mohammed a strong, if silent, ally.\n\nHowever, the myriad complexities, competing agendas and sheer size of the Saudi royal family - with more than a dozen princes with claims to Abdullah's throne - means that it is far too early to assume that Prince Mohammed will be the next Saudi king.\n\nBut his position on the chess board makes that possibility much stronger now than it ever was.\nTL;DR: The appointment of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as interior minister represents a significant move in the complex political chess game that is being played out in the Saudi royal family.\n\nArticle: By Jon KellyBBC News\n\nBy 3:01am, alone in a hospital room, Ann Fitzgerald reached for her phone. This would be her last chance to contact her husband of four decades, the man she'd raised two children with, her Tony - to Ann, he was always her Tony.\n\nThe couple had made a pact. So long as Ann was in hospital with Covid, Tony would spend his nights dozing upright in a chair at their bungalow in Pewfall, Merseyside. That way, he would wake up if there was a message alert. \n\nIt wasn't much of a sacrifice, Tony thought, not when the woman he'd loved for 47 years was all by herself and frightened. And besides, each time his phone bleeped Tony would know she was still alive, and silently he'd thank the stars.\n\nAnd so in the early hours of Tuesday 7 April, Ann's last message arrived. She'd summoned the energy to take a farewell selfie as she lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask.\"She must have thought:'Here's something so you won't forget me,'\"says Tony.\n\nTwo-and-a-half hours later, Ann was dead. She was 65, a mother, a wife, a neighbour, a colleague and a friend, and one of 999 people in the UK who died that day with the novel coronavirus.\n\nSoon after the hospital rang and told Tony of her death, he was at her bedside, dressed from head to toe in PPE. No visitors had been allowed to see her while she was alive, but now she was gone it was apparently fine - for reasons he didn't understand.\n\nTony wept as he apologised to his wife's lifeless body for letting her go like this, with no loved ones by her side. Then he turned and cursed the sterile white hospital ceiling and walls, because they'd been with her at the end and he hadn't.\n\nBack then, few could have imagined the UK's death toll would reach 100,000, or anything close to it.\n\nAt that point, the tally stood at 10,000; three weeks previously the UK government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance had said limiting the final figure to twice that sum would be a\"good outcome\".\n\nNow, 10 months on, the total number of people in the UK who have died within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis has increased tenfold, while UK excess deaths in 2020 were at their highest level since World War Two. The UK has had one of the highest rates of recorded coronavirus deaths in the world so far.\n\nBy any measure, 100,000 is a devastating amount, roughly equivalent to two Premier League football grounds, or the number of people who attend the Reading festival every year. For many people, the sheer scale of loss conveyed by the figure will be impossible to grasp.\n\n\"Numbers with lots of zeros are very difficult to interpret, and can be made to look large or small,\"says Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\"If I say that 100,000 deaths is two months' worth of normal mortality, then it may not look so bad.  If I say that it is more than all the [UK] civilian deaths in WW2, or as if everyone in a city the size of Durham got killed, then it sounds worse.  It is challenging to adequately convey such a large number of individual tragedies.\"\n\nBut while many may have become numb to the daily death figures, behind every statistic is a real life lost - a real life like Ann's.\"That is why this arbitrary numerical milestone is important,\"says Hetan Shah, chief executive of the British Academy and a former executive director of the Royal Statistical Society.\"It is a chance to reflect again on the terrible toll this pandemic has taken on so many British families.\"\n\nIn a Manchester nightclub one evening in 1973, 18-year-old Tony felt a tap on his arm. It was Ann, a year his senior, whom he knew by sight as a barmaid in one of the city-centre pubs he sometimes drank in. She'd always stood out to him, with her olive skin and striking good looks, but he'd never dared imagine she might be interested in him romantically. \n\n\"I'm here with that fella over there,\"she told him, gesturing towards across the room.\"But I don't like him and I don't know what to do.\"\n\nTony walked over to Ann's date and told him to clear off. Then Tony returned to Ann, and the two of them had a drink together, and then another. Before long they were a couple and Tony decided he was the luckiest man in the world.\n\nSoon he learned all about Ann's background. Her Lithuanian-born Jewish father had died when she was two years old, and with her mother unable to cope she'd been passed between relatives throughout her childhood. By 16 she was living in a bedsit, supporting herself with waitressing and bar work - she'd also been employed at the legendary art-deco Kardoma caf\u00e9 on Market Street and at George Best's nightclub, Oscar's.\n\n\"As a consequence of her upbringing she was really, really independent,\"says Tony.\"She was really good at talking to people, and she was sharp - the sharpest, wittiest person I've ever met.\"\n\nThey rented a flat in Fallowfield together and made it their home. After Ann was offered relief work running bars around Manchester, Tony quit his job as a sales rep to join her. Eventually, in 1981, they took on their own pub. It was in what was then a tough part of Salford, but Ann had grown up nearby and knew how to handle the local characters:\"She could have you in stitches, but she could throw you a look, and you knew you had to behave yourself,\"Tony says.\n\nThe couple were offered the chance to take on another pub in Sale Moor. They thought they were going upmarket, but it turned out to be quite the reverse; Tony would joke that he should take away all the tables and chairs and install a boxing ring instead. \n\nBut Ann wasn't intimidated by anyone. According to Tony, when a notorious local villain turned up and demanded a free drink, Ann stood her ground:\"My husband's name is above the front door, and he pays for his drinks, so you're going to pay for yours,\"she told him. Impressed, the villain ended up buying one for Ann instead.\n\nShe and Tony knew it was time to quit when burglars broke in one night while their baby daughter slept in her cot upstairs. Tony went back on the road as a salesman; Ann worked variously as a debt counsellor, an incident manager for the RAC, and a sales trainer at a cotton firm. Their children, Gary, and Rachel, never once heard them argue, Tony says.\n\nFor six years the couple had a stall at Altrincham Market selling women's clothes.\"People would come, not necessarily to buy something - they just wanted to see Ann,\"says Tony.\"And as a consequence, they'd buy something they didn't really want.\"Each time this happened, Ann would give Tony a wink.\n\nBy the start of 2020, Ann and Tony were looking forward to a long retirement together. Both their children had left home, and they'd recently moved to the bungalow. The news broadcasts had begun describing a deadly pandemic that had spread from China. But Ann wasn't leaving the house much while she recovered from an operation to replace both hips.  \n\nThen one Thursday in March she went for a haircut; she asked for the colour to be darkened slightly too, and when he first saw her afterwards Tony told her how much he loved it. Ann mentioned that the hairdresser had been coughing.\n\nThree days later, Ann began coughing too, and soon afterwards so did Tony. But with a fever, she felt worse, and within a few more days she was barely able to stand. She asked Tony to call 999. \n\nThe paramedics helped her to the ambulance. It haunts Tony now that he didn't hug or kiss her as they said goodbye.\"Neither of us thought for one moment that it would be the last day I would ever see her alive,\"he says. She told him they'd probably give her antibiotics and he could come and pick her up in a few hours.\n\nBut later that day she phoned him to say the doctors suspected Covid and they would be keeping her in. As in many hospitals during the first wave, no visiting was allowed.\n\nTony could only stay in touch with her by phone. When a doctor told him the next 24 hours were critical, he didn't tell Ann, because he knew how scared she was already by then. \n\nBut he did pass on something else the medic had said - that they were deeply impressed by her upbeat attitude and fighting spirit. Tony told her, too, that he believed she would be home soon:\"I had to say that to keep her fighting, and fight she did for 10 days.\"\n\nThe last time they spoke was Saturday 4 April. Ann told Tony she thought she'd turned a corner; she'd eaten a sandwich and some yoghurt. After that, talking became too difficult for her; she wasn't in intensive care but the mask she wore to help her breathe was getting in the way.\n\nThree days after their last conversation, Tony was sitting in a white hospital room beside Ann's body. He sat with her there for an hour. He didn't just apologise, he also promised he'd make sure she was remembered properly. When it was time to leave, a nurse gave him a booklet about bereavement and a black bag in which to put Ann's belongings. Tony carried them along a hospital corridor, wondering how he would tell Gary and Rachel their mum was dead. \n\nThere are eight photographs of Ann in Tony's living room. In each of them she looks full of joy.\"Every time I look around, there's a picture of Ann somewhere,\"Tony says.\"She's smiling and I'm thinking,'If only I could turn back the clock.' But I can't, you know, and nor can all those other families and relations, either.\"\n\nNearly 10 months after Ann's death, Tony finds himself resenting the home he's been left alone inside. If they hadn't moved there, he reasons, Ann wouldn't have gone to that hairdresser's that day and caught the virus - she'd still be alive, perhaps. \n\nHe feels robbed of the 20 additional years he hoped they'd spend together, as surely will thousands of other bereaved relatives. While the impact on the very oldest has been widely recognised, those who might have looked forward to a long retirement have been badly hit, too - during the pandemic, around 15% of all UK fatalities with Covid mentioned on the death certificate have been among those aged 65-74. \n\nTony desperately wishes his life would go back to how it was, but knows it won't.\n\nAnn's funeral didn't give him any closure. Tony would rather she had been buried, but the undertaker warned him to hurry - extra restrictions could be introduced any time - so he took the date that was offered by the crematorium. \n\nAs it was, under the rules that were already in force, only 10 mourners were permitted, spaced out around the chapel. No flowers or photographs on display, no hugging. \n\nTony understood why all this was necessary - but it wasn't the celebration of Ann's bright, gregarious, love-filled life that he thought she deserved. He'd have to plan another one when all this was over.\n\nAs the months went on, Tony joined online Covid support groups. It helped talking to others who understood how it felt to have lost someone. There was the family of a 19-year-old boy. A woman who was mourning both her mum and her dad. Another woman whose husband had died in the car as she drove him to hospital.\n\nHe thought of these stories each time he switched on the news and watched the Covid mortality figures climb higher and higher. Behind these cold statistics were human lives. And each was as unique as Ann, with a personality and backstory entirely of their own. \n\nIt would have been Ann and Tony's 41st wedding anniversary on 6 October, the day before the six-month anniversary of her death. The following month, a few days after the UK's Covid death toll reached 50,000, Tony once again felt Ann's absence bitterly on what would have been her 66th birthday.\n\n\"Christmas was a nightmare for me,\"he says. Under the rules for the festive season, Gary and Rachel and their partners were able to be there with him, and cooking lunch kept him busy most of the day. But afterwards, when he was on his own again, the reality hit that another celebration had gone by without Ann beside him, and Tony sat down and sobbed.\n\nFor millions the arrival of the Covid vaccines has brought hope, but it is a cold comfort for those who have lost someone. If every one of the 100,000 were loved by a dozen people,\"that's a million people in Britain who have been bereaved\", says the bioethicist and sociologist Prof Sir Tom Shakespeare.\"We need a national monument, some form of remembering.\"\n\nTony is not one of those who will find it hard to grasp the significance of this bleak milestone.\n\n\"To me it's 100,000 poor souls fighting for breath, and they've not had a hug from anyone in their family,\"he says.\"There's a name - there's a person behind that number. And then they've passed away, and the family goes through the grief that I've been through - the numbness, the shock, the anguish and the pain to come.\"\n\nFollow @mrjonkelly on Twitter\n\nPicture editor: Emma Lynch.

In hot weather, why not take a cooling dip in the sea, and leave lockdown constraints on the beach with your towel?  But apart from the crowds and infection risk, beware of the political and economic undercurrents.  \n\nBrexit is about to surface once more - a giant creature that's been lurking in the shallows while attention has been turned elsewhere. With each round of inconclusive talks, it is those waters, and specifically the fish and shellfish in them, that become more central to the outcome.\n\nIt features a trial of negotiating strength, guile and apparently quite a lot of self-delusion. A great deal more depends on the outcome than the fishery jobs.\n\nYes, it's four months since the UK left the European Union, and seven months until the transition is scheduled to end. This week is an important one for deciding the terms of the new relationship, and the early signs are that it's going badly.\n\nSo it's time for an update, with a reminder of what was going on last time you paid any attention. \n\nAussie-style\n\nAt the end of January, Boris Johnson was busy booking his place in history, or so he thought.  What he was doing rather less was heeding the warning klaxons about an infection spreading rapidly in China. It's the latter that seems more likely to define his term as prime minister.\n\nHowever, the way things are looking, we could be heading not only for the biggest recession at least since the 1930s, thanks to Covid-19, but also that Brexit cliff-edge we were talking about last year. \n\nThere's no sign of entente breaking out via the Microsoft Teams meetings that have had to become the diplomatic channels for UK and EU negotiating teams.\n\nSupporters of Brexit are determined there will not be a delay on the 31 December end to transition. That remains, firmly, the government's position. \n\nIt can't simply play for time, and kick the can down Theresa May Boulevard, because the transition deal states that any delay has to be for at least two years. To Brexiteer Tory MPs, that's an impossibly high price for accepting an extension.\n\nLater this month, in a summit meeting, the two sides are scheduled to reflect on their negotiations and make a judgement as to whether it is worth continuing the effort to get a deal.\n\nAnd if they conclude there is not, those Brexiteers say: so be it - the UK would be trading with the European Union on what we have learned to call World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. Mr Johnson calls them Australia-style terms. Either way, they are the WTO's least effective arrangements to ease trading.\n\n'Johnny Foreigner'\n\nFor now, there are two broad schools of thinking on this.  One embraces a future where Britain can shed Europe's environmental, social and labour rules, and become more competitive than the European Union. For them, sovereignty is all and compromise is for Johnny Foreigner.\n\nThe other is aghast - looking at the unprecedented calamity that has struck the British, European and global economies due to Covid-19, and wondering how anyone could consider this a good time to take a risk on a full break from Europe's single market and customs union.  \n\nBrexiteer outrider commentators are arguing that the Brexit pain won't feel so bad in the context of suffering something much worse. \n\nBut from the academic network known as UK in a Changing Europe, there's been a reminder that their modelling suggests an economy that will grow 8.1% less in the next 10 years than it might otherwise be expected to do, while UK government modelling suggests a 7.6% shortfall.\n\n(We're very unlikely to be able to measure the true impact of Brexit, because there will be other, very powerful factors at work in trying to repair the economy post-pandemic. The closest we're likely to get is by comparison with similar countries still inside the EU.)\n\n'Dispensable'\n\nIn this crunch week of talks, the negotiating gulf is around promises which the EU members thought they had secured in tying Britain to Europe's\"level playing field\"of common standards on environment, social and labour market standards. \n\nThere is a big gap also on their expectation of how disputes over such standards will be resolved. The EU wants that in its Court of Justice. The UK says\"no way, Jose\".\n\nAnd then there's fish.  How is it that fisheries have become the third track of disagreement and impasse? And why, when one considers the industry is tiny, relative to the British economy (0.1% of economic output) and population, and it's tinier by EU ones?\n\nOne part of the answer is that fishing occupies a totemic and political role more than an economically significant one.  This was the British industry that was hit hardest by entry into the European Common Market. Whitehall in the 1970s saw it as\"dispensable\", or so it was admitted in an internal memo.\n\nEverything since then - including increased efficiency of catch forcing a reduction in the number of boats and men, and the harsh counter-measures to over-fishing - has been implemented through European institutions, so it's been blamed on Brussels. It has come, therefore, to be a special focus for Brexiteers.\n\nWith well over half the tonnage of fish caught in UK waters landed by foreign-registered boats - roughly eight times the amount caught by British boats in EU countries' waters - it has also become commercially important to the fishing fleets of the UK's nearest neighbours.\n\nQuid pro quo\n\nThe EU negotiating mandate wants to retain what it calls\"relative stability\", which is an allocation of quota based on the shares back in the 1970s. If anyone thinks European capitals are ready to go soft on Michel Barnier's mandate, they should be aware that he was told to strengthen the mandate - that is, not to trade away those fishing rights. \n\nLook at it from President Emmanuel Macron's point of view: his re-election efforts will not be helped if there's uproar and port blockades in the politically-significant Pas de Calais region. We recently got a taste of what is a serious risk, with a skirmish between boats fishing around the Channel Islands.\n\nThe British want annual negotiations, based on sustainable quotas. In the jargon, at which fishery management excels, it's called\"zonal attachment\". This assumes that the British government will have control over UK waters, so its fleet will get a much bigger share. \n\nThis is important to the UK negotiating position, which is the other reason fishing is disproportionately important to these talks.  This is one industry on which the UK has leverage. It has a lot to gain from ending CFP quotas, and a lot it could give.\n\nBut it needs to avoid quid pro quo deals in which fish are traded with access to European markets where the UK badly needs concessions from Brussels, such as the finance sector's reach into European markets.\n\nParking the sharing of fish quotas, by saying they'll be decided each year on the evidence available, and that Britain can relate to the CFP in the same way as Norway, would avoid the pressure to give ground on quota specifics as part of an over-arching deal.\n\nThe EU is firmly saying that the whole deal has to be integrated, without such side deals.  It also has some leverage on fisheries, in that Britain sells a lot of fish into the European market, and there are more jobs in processing than in fishing.\n\nNot all fishing businesses or communities are as gung-ho for Brexit as in north-east Scotland or Cornwall. Neither Hebridean creelmen nor Grimsby gutters want the disadvantage of tariffs being levied on those export sales, or of delays at the Channel for delivery of fresh produce.\n\nCapitulation\n\nHow will this work out?  With difficulty. Negotiations often involve bluster, claiming to be digging in to\"red line\"negotiating positions and timetables. The British side has been big on that approach since the 2016 referendum, allied to a consistent misreading of where negotiating power lies. It hasn't worked well so far, instead leading to a series of embarrassing capitulations. But this week, it's still the tactic being used.\n\nThis month, Boris Johnson will have to choose whether he continues the talks or plays to hardliners in his party who prefer\"no deal\"to compromise.\n\nThrough his handling of lockdown and the Cummings affair, the prime minister has weakened his position within Tory ranks. Facing him in the Commons, he now has a Labour opponent, in Sir Keir Starmer, who can hound him over the choice he makes.\n\nThe current impasse may turn out to be bluff. There's no point in hinting at an extension until the point when you have to propose one. Compromises, when they eventually come, tend to be made quickly.\n\nBut surprises aren't always welcome. For both sides, there is the need to get the deal through the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments.  Westminster is one. \n\nAnother parliament, without a veto, is at Holyrood. It will have a say, however, and a noisy one, in the months leading up to the next election. \n\nIn Scotland, Brexit is a faultline that currently looks likely to suit the SNP better than Jackson Carlaw's Tories.\nTL;DR: Time for an update on Brexit, which hasn't gone away, and nor have the UK or EU edged any closer to a deal on their future relationship. Boris Johnson goes into a summit this month, where he decides whether to keep trying for an agreement, or walk away and pay the high economic cost of 'no deal'. Fisheries has become a totemic and a real obstacle to a deal, where compromise looks particularly difficult, and here's why.\n\nArticle: By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News\n\nThe western-style adventure is set in the aftermath of a failed train robbery and is actually the prequel to the original 2010 title.\n\nIt's the first major release for studio Rockstar Games since the launch of Grand Theft Auto V in 2013.\n\nReviewers have praised its advanced graphics and storytelling, but the studio has also faced criticism. \n\nHere are five things to know about it.\n\n1. The game files are enormous\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 requires 107 gigabytes of installation space on the Xbox One. \n\nOn the PlayStation 4 it's 99GB with an extra 50GB required for installation, the studio has said.\n\nAccording to the games site Games Radar that makes the game the heftiest PS4 download ever.\n\nSecond on its list was Battlefield 4 Premium Edition, weighing in at 71GB.\n\nThe game is so big because of its expansive world and attention to tiny details (more on that in a moment) - but it could prove an obstacle to fans with slow broadband and limited storage.\n\n2. Those little details...\n\nOne of the reasons why the game is so enormous is that there are a lot of exquisite little details.\n\nThe detail that has inevitably caught everybody's attention is that apparently when the weather is cold, a certain part of the horse's anatomy can be seen to shrink. \n\nLike in Grand Theft Auto, the weather conditions and even interactions between the 200 species of in-game wildlife are auto-generated, and each item held by the main character, Arthur Morgan, is individually rendered so it moves in its own right as he rides on his horse.\n\n3. RIP Horses\n\nSpeaking of horses - in Red Dead Redemption 2, if your horse dies, it stays dead. You won't see it again. People are very sad about this.\n\n4. Long working hours for studio staff\n\nIn a Vulture magazine interview, Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser praised staff for working 100-hour weeks to get Red Dead Redemption 2 finished. \n\nIt had already missed two previous launch dates - Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 - on the grounds that it wasn't ready.\n\nMr Houser has since clarified that he was referring only to himself and three other members of the senior writing team. \n\nHowever so-called\"crunch culture\"is a controversial area of games development, where developers can be asked or feel obliged to work long hours in the run-up to a title release.\n\n\"The problem is that most people in games get into games because they love them, and that lets companies take advantage of these,\"said Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings creator Mike Dailly.\n\n\"They push developers to work these stupid hours, yet they could easily release the game with a little less content, and it would still be a massive game.\"\n\n5. The gameplay takes 60 hours\n\nDan Houser told Vulture magazine that the 60-hour story mode was shortened from 65 hours in the edit by abandoning a love interest. \n\nFor context, experiencing everything Grand Theft Auto V has to offer would take more than 100 hours, Mr Houser told The Guardian in 2013 when it came out.\n\nHowever it's often said most gamers don't ever finish a game - CNN once put the figure at 90%.\nTL;DR: The hotly anticipated game Red Dead Redemption 2 is due for release on Friday.\n\nArticle: The chief inspector of prisons wants home detention curfews used more to cut the number of adults in jail. \n\nDavid Strang's first annual report said, while there had been a drop in young offenders detained, the rise in adult prisoners was\"disappointing\".\n\nHe called for more longer-sentence inmates to be moved to lower levels of supervision in preparation for release.\n\nThis would involve more home detention curfews or \"tagging\".\n\nMr Strang said tackling drug and alcohol problems was needed to break the vicious circle of reoffending and more effort should be put into rehabilitation programmes.\n\nHe said:\"Much more should be done to work with people on short-term sentences so that they are prepared for release and have something constructive to go to.\n\n\"I believe there should be fewer people in prisons and then what the prison service can do with them is more constructive and is more likely to lead to reducing reoffending.\"\nTL;DR: Scotland's prison population is still rising despite efforts to tackle over-crowding.\n\nArticle: \"I've seen a great doctor,\"the singer said in a statement, adding that he was\"happy and relieved that anything serious has been ruled out\".\n\nU2 fans were left disappointed when the Berlin show was cut short on Saturday.\n\nThe Irish band had played several songs before Bono apologised to the crowd, saying:\"I think we can't go on.\"\n\nThose at the Mercedes-Benz Arena were initially told there would be a short pause, but were later informed that the show was over. Bono then promised that another gig would be arranged.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, the singer said his\"relief\"at being able to return to performing was\"tempered by the knowledge that the Berlin audience were so inconvenienced\". \n\n\"There was an amazing atmosphere in the house, it was going to be one of those unforgettable nights but not for this reason\u2026 We can't wait to get back there on 13 November,\"the statement added. \n\nWhat happened on Saturday?\n\nIt was the second night of the European leg of U2's Experience + Innocence tour, which had kicked off at the same venue on Friday night. \n\nBono had been singing Red Flag Day when he lost his voice, according to those at the concert. \n\nU2 fan Paul Jones said:\"During the fourth song, Red Flag Day, Bono's voice deteriorated massively - he said it was something to do with the smoke that was set off.\"\n\nHe was trying to\"soldier on\"with the next song, Beautiful Day, when he called a stop to proceedings.\n\nIn a video posted by a fan of the Saturday night concert, Bono appeared to be coughing and told fans he was\"so sorry\". \n\n\"I'm sure this is not a big, big problem - but I'm going to have to do something.\"he said.\"If people want to go home, that's fine - we'll play another show for you another time.\"\n\nBono said he needed a short break\"to find out what's happening\"but then did not return. \n\n\"Bono was in great form and great voice prior to the show and we were all looking forward to the second night in Berlin, but after a few songs, he suffered a complete loss of voice,\"U2 later said in a statement.\n\nMany fans responded that they understood and wished Bono well. \n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It was absolutely superb and I'm proud of them all,\"she said.\n\nThe Guardian's Mark Lawson said:\"Everything seemed smooth, although the producers were clever in setting every scene among characters under stress or grief, so any flapping might have been taken as acting.\"\n\nIn The Independent Gerard Gilbert called the live show an\"exciting, well-crafted episode of a soap opera\", but suggested there were a few mistakes.\n\n\"Alison King as Carla seemed to lose the thread at one point, but it's hard to be sure in the circumstances, and William Roache was a bit indistinct at times, but then he was standing over his son's deathbed,\"he wrote. \n\nThe Metro's Rachel Tarley claimed there were a\"few camera-focus issues\"but it was\"actually nigh-on impossible to tell the hour-long special apart from a regular Corrie episode\".\n\nAlthough she added there was\"a lot of tearless crying as some of the actors struggled to turn on the waterworks on cue\".\n\nThere have been months of speculation about the identities of those who would be killed off in the catastrophe.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ashley Peacock - a Street regular for 14 years, played by Steven Arnold - was seen being crushed to death after the Joinery bar collapsed.\n\nOn Thursday, viewers saw Peter Barlow and Molly Dobbs seem to succumb to their injuries.\n\nThe storyline has been billed as\"four funerals and a wedding\".\n\nThe show's golden jubilee episode was its first live edition for a decade.\n\nThe show's last live broadcast was screened in 2000 to mark the soap's 40th anniversary.\n\nCoronation Street, created by scriptwriter Tony Warren, was originally commissioned for 13 episodes and first went out on 9 December 1960.\nTL;DR: The live 50th anniversary episode of Coronation Street attracted an average audience of 14 million people, according to overnight figures.\n\nArticle: Mendip School said the NASS Festival at the nearby Bath & West Showground meant it was unable to ensure an\"appropriate and protective\"environment for its pupils.\n\nThe showground society has apologised.\n\nEvent organiser Vision Nine has also apologised and has asked festival-goers\"to respect our neighbours\".\n\nA Vision Nine spokesman said:\"We are in touch directly with The Mendip School to offer any additional support required during NASS Festival. \n\n\"We were made aware yesterday of disruption to parents picking their children up from the school. \n\n\"We apologise to parents and the teachers for this inconvenience. \n\n\"We thank local residents for their patience and apologise to those affected by yesterday's slow moving traffic.

And her baby was taken away before she could say goodbye. \n\nHer family believes the baby was buried with someone else but they were never told where.\n\nCommunal plot \n\nAfter tracing a baby for a friend, Paula Jackson set up a website offering to help other families. \n\nIn the past 15 years, she has helped to trace nearly 800 babies through her charity Brief Lives Remembered.\n\nYvonne, one of the women Paula has helped, gave birth to a stillborn son 40 years ago.\n\n\"Why didn't I hold him? Why didn't I look at him? It was too late, he'd gone,\"Yvonne said.\n\n\"All I had was a priest come to see me and to say that he will have a proper burial. Next morning - ready to go home, that was it.\"\n\nPaula said families were effectively asked to carry on as though nothing had happened.\n\n\"Fathers were often advised to hide any baby products at home to help with the healing process,\"she said.\n\n\"In some cases, men were also asked for money for the burial - some dads kept their receipt as their only memento.\n\n\"The bodies of babies were either cremated, buried in a communal plot or placed in the coffin of a woman who had recently passed away. \n\n\"This information was not always shared with either family.\"\n\nPaula said the women were kept in maternity wards, surrounded by mothers and their new babies, and in some instances were asked to breastfeed when others needed help. \n\nLeft gravestones\n\nIn some military cemeteries, each baby was given their own burial plot. \n\nAnd in Aldershot Military Cemetery - where Paula traced the first\"lost\"baby - each plot was identifiable by a green marker. \n\nSome families have now traced their babies and left gravestones. Others are left nameless.\n\n\"When you look and you hear accounts of what happened in the past, it feels very cold, clinical and very disconnected,\"Melissa Whitten, a consultant obstetrician at University College London Hospitals, said.\n\n'Post-traumatic stress'\n\nNowadays, families are taken to a separate room to grieve and spend time with their child. \n\nMemory boxes are also provided, which include photos and hand prints.\n\nCarolyn Harris believes her mother suffered post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"My mother was the most wonderful woman but she put a wall up after she lost my sister,\"she said.\n\n\"She was afraid that if she showed too much emotion, something bad would happen.\"\n\nThe MP's own son, Martin, died at the age of eight. \n\n\"I went to the grave site and I sat there and I talked to him for days,\"she said.\n\n\"There's the guilt, there's the anger, there's the regret.

It's not acceptable. \n\n\"The aim is sound, but we can't have people suffering on the way. The idea that there's a cliff edge in April before the uptake in wages comes in is a real practical human problem and the government needs to look again at it.\"\n\nMs Davidson said on Have I Got News For You on Friday that she would like to see\"some movement\"on the issue by the autumn statement.\n\nWhat are tax credits and what are the changes?\n\nTax credits are a series of benefits introduced by the last Labour government to help low-paid families. There are two types: Working Tax Credit (WTC) for those in work, and Child Tax Credit (CTC) for those with children. \n\nUnder government proposals, the income threshold for Working Tax Credits - \u00a36,420 - will be cut to \u00a33,850 a year from April.\n\nIn other words, as soon as someone earns \u00a33,850, they will see their payments reduced. The income threshold for those only claiming CTCs will be cut from \u00a316,105 to \u00a312,125.\n\nThe rate at which those payments are cut is also going to get faster. Currently, for every \u00a31 claimants earn above the threshold, they lose 41p. This is known as the taper rate. But from April, the taper rate will accelerate to 48p. \n\nThere will be similar reductions for those who claim work allowances under the new Universal Credit.\n\nRead more about the changes\nTL;DR: The whole of the Scottish political establishment is against the UK government's tax credit changes, SNP MP Pete Wishart has claimed.\n\nArticle: By Judith BurnsEducation reporter, BBC News\n\nSome candidates, for example those with disabilities or medical conditions, are allowed adjustments to their exams.\n\nThese can include extra time, a reader or scribe, coloured exam papers or a sign-language interpreter. \n\nLast year saw a 10% rise in such requests from schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, says Ofqual. \n\n\"We will be asking exam boards to investigate, and we will be talking to schools to find out more\", said Michelle Meadows, Ofqual's executive director of strategy, risk and research. \n\nDuring the 2013-14 academic year there were 271,850 requests for access arrangements - up 10% on the year before, says Ofqual. \n\nTighter rules\n\nBut Ofqual says a tightening of the rules for access arrangements, particularly for extra time, had resulted in a fall in requests in 2012-13. \n\nThe numbers of requests have now increased so they are in line with previous levels, says the regulator.    \n\nThese requests were for 168,400 candidates - a rise of 9% on the previous year. Most requests (almost 92%) were approved, again a 9% increase. \n\nOfqual says the total number of requests is higher than the number of candidates as schools and colleges may request more than one type of access arrangement for a candidate. \n\n\"For example a candidate may require both a reader and a scribe.\"\n\nThe regulator puts the number of requests into context by pointing out that in 2014, there were more than 1.2 million GCSE candidates and almost 700,000  for AS or A-Levels.  \n\nOfqual says the most frequently granted access arrangement was the allowance of up to 25% extra time, for which 132,050 requests were approved last year, representing over half (53%) of all approved access arrangements. \n\nOther types of access arrangements include bilingual dictionaries or requests for modified exam papers, for example printing on coloured paper can help some dyslexic students, while visually impaired candidates can request papers in large print or in Braille.\nTL;DR: The exams regulator Ofqual is to investigate a rise in requests from schools for special arrangements for candidates at GCSE and A-level.\n\nArticle: The warship arrived at the Highlands port for a pre-planned stopover more than two weeks ago.\n\nWhile at Invergordon, precautionary checks were made of the vessel after debris had earlier become caught around one of its propeller shafts.\n\nThe item of debris cleared by itself and the propeller shaft was examined by divers.\n\nWhile in Invergordon, the crew added some personal touches to the multi-billion pound vessel.\n\nThese included a piece of kit being given a tongue-in-cheek paint job and being turned into a Minion, a character from the Despicable Me movies.\n\nHMS Queen Elizabeth is being put through sea trials after leaving Rosyth dockyard in Fife where it was built.\n\nAfter leaving the Cromarty Firth and entering the nearby Moray Firth, the ship was visited by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.\n\nHe was flown to HMS Queen Elizabeth from RAF Lossiemouth on a military Merlin helicopter.\n\nAll images are copyrighted.\nTL;DR: The new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has left Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth to continue sea trials.\n\nArticle: Russia says at least 62 Syrian troops were killed in the Deir al-Zour strikes on Saturday.\n\nThe US has expressed\"regret\"for the\"unintentional loss of life\".\n\nSyria says it has lost a warplane in the area, which so-called Islamic State (IS) said it had shot down.\n\nThe BBC's Lina Sinjab, reporting from Beirut, says it is rare for the Syrian government to acknowledge losses caused by IS, and the announcement may be intended to draw attention to the consequences of the US-led air strike. \n\nA Syrian army source said the attack had allowed IS to gain ground in the area around the Syrian airbase, but that Syrian forces had regained most positions on the hilltop nearby with the help of Syrian and Russian air support.\n\nThe attack put\"a very big question mark\"over the truce's future, said Russia's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin.\n\nA ceasefire deal agreed by the US and Russia went into effect in Syria on Monday, but important terms of the deal, such as the safe passage of aid, have still not been fulfilled.\n\nMonitors on Sunday reported the first air strikes in Aleppo since the truce took effect.\n\nSeveral people were injured in the air raids, said the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, but it could not identify who carried them out.\n\n'American heavy-handedness'\n\nThe air attack caused a bitter row between the US and Russia at the United Nations Security Council on Saturday night, with each country's representatives walking out while the other was speaking.\n\nUS envoy Samantha Power criticised Russia for calling an emergency meeting of the council, which she said was\"cynical and hypocritical\".\n\n\"Russia really needs to stop the cheap points-scoring and the grandstanding and the stunts and focus on what matters, which is implementation of something we negotiated in good faith with them,\"she told reporters.\n\nBut Mr Churkin said he had never seen\"such an extraordinary display of American heavy-handedness\"as shown by Ms Power.\n\nHe implied the future of the Syria deal could rest on how Washington reacts to the incident.\n\n\"If what Ambassador Power has done today is any indication of their possible reaction then we are in serious trouble,\"Mr Churkin said.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities brokered jointly by the US and Russia does not include attacks on IS or other jihadist groups.\n\nAnalysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus\n\nWashington's mistaken air strikes on Syrian government forces raise several questions; not least why American aircraft were hitting what they thought were IS positions in an area where IS was engaged with Syrian forces.\n\nThe US role is clearly not directly to assist Mr Assad's troops against IS fighters.  \n\nThe strikes, belatedly called off after the Russians notified the Americans, have made a delicate situation even more complex.\n\nThey have put at risk a ceasefire that so far, is only partial, and that has not yet provided the promised access for aid deliveries to begin in earnest.  \n\nThe error - admitted by the Pentagon - is bound to erode what limited trust, if any, exists between Washington and Moscow. If the ceasefire does survive, that is going to make implementing any plans for a coordinated US-Russian air campaign against IS that much harder. \n\nHow the Americans explained the attack\n\nUS Central Command said the coalition believed it was attacking IS positions and the raids were\"halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military\".\n\nIt said the\"Combined Air Operations Center had earlier informed Russian counterparts of the upcoming strike\".\n\nThe strike and circumstances surrounding it will be reviewed it said,\"to see if any lessons can be learned\".\n\nAustralian aircraft also took part in the bombing. Its Department of Defence offered its condolences to the families of government soldiers killed or wounded.\n\nResponse to the US account\n\nRussia's foreign ministry spokeswoman has been quoted as saying that the attack showed\"that the White House is defending Islamic State\".\n\nSyria's foreign ministry said it was\"planned and deliberate\"and suggested\"pre-coordination between IS and the US forces\".\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported the strikes had killed at least 90 soldiers.\n\nOnly if the current ceasefire - which began on Monday - holds for seven days, will the US and Russia begin co-ordinated action against the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham group, which was previously known as the al-Nusra Front, and IS.\n\nThere have been no previous confirmed cases of US air strikes targeting Syrian troops. Last December, Syria accused the coalition of attacking a government army camp in Deir al-Zour but the US denied it.\n\nRussia's military had already expressed fears for the ceasefire. It said rebel groups had increased attacks and it urged the US to act or be responsible for the collapse of the truce.\n\nGeneral Viktor Poznikhir said:\"Our repeated messages to the American side are left without a response. There is doubt that the US is able to influence the moderate opposition they control.\"\n\nThe terms require moderate rebel groups to separate themselves from jihadists.\n\nA US National Security Council spokesman later said the cessation was\"broadly holding\"despite\"challenges on both sides\".\n\nThe deal was meant to allow the safe passage of aid to besieged areas of Syria, but some 20 trucks have been waiting in Turkey since Monday, unable to travel to rebel-held east Aleppo.\n\nThe Syrian truce\n\nHow will the new Syria truce work?\nTL;DR: A US-led air attack in eastern Syria that killed dozens of government troops fighting so-called Islamic State has endangered an already shaky ceasefire deal, Russia says.\n\nArticle: \"Upland\"will see students and staff from Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) take over Cultybraggan Camp at Comrie.\n\nThe old prisoners' cells, guard-houses and surrounding hills are being filled with sound, installations, performance art, photography and film.\n\nGuided tours are also being offered around the camp, includes a nuclear fall-out bunker and firing range.\n\nUpland will run through the day on Saturday, when dozens of artists will display and take part in installations and performances.\n\nThose exhibiting work in the camp include Zoe Walker, Susan Mowatt, and Turner Prize nominee Marvin Gaye Chetwynd.\n\nOne artist plans to spend up to 96 hours in solitary confinement in a cell, surrounded by letters from her grandfather who during WW2 was captured and interned by German forces in Greece, Austria and Germany.\n\nOther installations will see a guard's hut converted into a hotdog stand and a tent filled with the sound of nearby rivers.\n\nTours offered\n\nCultybraggan is one of three preserved World War Two PoW camps in the UK.\n\nIt housed German and Italian prisoners of war between 1941 and 1946, including many high-ranking SS officers.\n\nMany of the site's Nissen Huts are A and B-listed, and tours are offered around them and the site's nuclear bunker as part of Upland.\n\nSusan Mowatt, artist and tutor at ECA, said:\"This has been a fantastic opportunity for staff and students from the Intermedia Art programme to make work away from the studios in Edinburgh and beyond the gallery context, engaging directly with this incredible site and its evolving uses as well as connecting with local organisations and people.\"\n\nBlair Urquhart, a trustee of Comrie Development Trust, said:\"This has been a great chance to bring artists and historians, local business and local clubs together to appreciate all the things that Cultybraggan Camp has been and will be. \n\n\"We are looking forward to a splendid event and from what I've seen so far, Edinburgh College of Art are bringing a new dimension to the cultural life of the prison camp and to the village. \n\n\"It will be thought provoking, challenging and funny and a great day out for everyone.\"\nTL;DR: A former prisoner of war camp in Perthshire is being taken over by artists for a day.\n\nArticle: Cuadrilla's plans for fracking at its Preston New Road site at Little Plumpton were approved in October.\n\nThe firm says it will put Lancashire first for creating jobs, new skills, investment, and community initiatives.\n\nOpponents said they were surprised by the news since a legal challenge to the government's decision is outstanding.\n\nPreston New Road Action Group issued formal legal proceedings at the High Court in November.\n\nCuadrilla's commitments\n\nCuadrilla said an\"independently audited tracker\"will monitor its pledges to Lancashire.\n\nChief executive Francis Egan said the shale gas industry would be good for the county's economy.\n\n\"We expect that in the exploration phase alone we will spend in the order of \u00a350m -

\n\nAnd what would happen if a deal was agreed only at the very last minute? \n\nCould the transition period be extended?\n\nThe transition period was designed to preserve current arrangements temporarily and avoid disruption, to allow for negotiations.\n\nBut there is no legal basis for extending it.\n\nIt's part of an international treaty, the Brexit withdrawal agreement, that said any extension would have to be agreed before 1 July 2020. \n\nAnd the UK decided not to ask for an extension.\n\nCould there be another sort of extension?\n\nIf they wanted to, EU governments and the UK could, in theory, come up with an international agreement outside EU law to give them a temporary extension. \n\nSome international lawyers have also suggested it might be possible to reuse Article 50, the legal basis for the UK's exit from the EU. \n\nBut EU lawyers have rejected that.\n\nAny plan for a further brief extension would probably be challenged in the courts.\n\nBut it could buy a few extra weeks before that challenge was heard. \n\nAgain in theory, that could allow the two sides to complete negotiations not quite finished or give more time for parliaments on both sides to examine a deal properly. \n\nThe UK has said in the past it will not consider any kind of extension. \n\nBut it wouldn't be the first time the impossible suddenly becomes possible in negotiations involving the EU, once creative lawyers sit down at the table. \n\n\"It's legally tricky,\"Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law, at the University of Cambridge, says.\n\n\"But you should never underestimate the ingenuity of lawyers, particularly when their backs are up against the wall.\"\n\nIs a last-minute deal possible?\n\nAny agreement would need to be vetted by lawyers on both sides - they call it\"legal scrubbing\"- and translated.\n\nMost of that has probably already been done - there are only a few areas of disagreement left. \n\nBut the deal would still have to be scrutinised and approved - or ratified - by parliamentarians.\n\nAnd the time to go through hundreds of pages of dense legal text with any degree of thoroughness is fast running out. \n\nIf there were to be awkward compromises hidden within the text - and there would be - there are politicians who would like to find them. \n\nAn agreement would, after all, form the basis of EU-UK relations for years to come. \n\nIn the UK, that scrutiny would happen at Westminster, where the government has a big majority in the House of Commons. \n\nThe devolved parliaments and assemblies would not have a separate vote. \n\nNormally, a treaty can be ratified only at least 21 sitting - or working - days after it has first been presented to Parliament. \n\nBut in exceptional circumstances, the government has the power to push ratification through in a single day.\n\nWhat about EU parliaments? \n\nThe process on the EU side would be more complicated because 27 countries are involved. \n\nAgreements are described as either\"EU only\", which means they involve changing things which are the exclusive responsibility of the EU as a whole, or\"mixed\", which means they also include things which are the exclusive responsibility of individual member states.\n\nMixed agreements usually need to be ratified by national and in some cases regional parliaments - but not always.  \n\nThe recent EU-Japan free trade agreement, for example, contained some mixed provisions but it was decided ratification was necessary at EU level only. \n\nAnd it is widely assumed the same thing would happen with an EU-UK deal. \n\nIn those circumstances a deal would need the written agreement of the Council of the European Union, which could be signed off by government ministers or even ambassadors from each of the member states, and the consent of members of the European Parliament (MEPs). \n\n\"Both could give their approval as late as 31 December,\"Georgina Wright, an associate at the Institute for Government, says. \n\n\"Though ideally MEPs would schedule their vote a few days before then.\n\nThe second option would be to provisionally apply the agreement, either in part or in full.\"\n\nCould the agreement be applied anyway?\n\nEU law (Article 218 paragraph 5 of the EU treaty) allows the council to give the go-ahead for an agreement to be signed and applied provisionally, without formally consulting the European Parliament. \n\nThat means things such as tariff-free trade - with no taxes to pay on imports - could continue without parliamentary consent.\n\nBut that's never happened with an EU trade deal before.\n\nAnd it would be very controversial with some MEPs. \n\nBut plenty of MEPs say they need more time to examine an agreement properly.\n\nAnd this would be another way to give them that time. \n\nThe alternative would be to have a brief no-deal period in January before a delayed agreement came into force.\n\nBut that would mean added disruption.\n\nA provisional arrangement would also be in line with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), a piece of international trade law that allows countries to reach\"interim\"agreements, so they can offer preferential trade terms to each other before they have signed off a full trade deal. \n\nWe've talked about Article XXIV before. \n\nEarlier in the Brexit process, it was incorrectly put forward as a solution to allow free trade even if no agreement was in place. \n\nSo it's a race against time?\n\nFor now, everything rests on intense negotiations behind the scenes. \n\n\"The clock puts us all in a very difficult situation,\"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told MEPs on 16 December,\"not least this parliament and its right to exercise democratic scrutiny and ratification.\" \n\nThe process is unlikely to be straightforward over the next few weeks, partly because this is all uncharted territory. \n\nBut if no-deal is the end result, it won't be the process that is responsible. \n\nIt will be politics.  \n\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

He had signed up to fight in the war and was on leave from the trenches.\n\n\"He was the most important man in the world to me, I loved every inch of him, and we were the apples of his eye; I really do think he worshipped us,\"she said.\n\n\"My brother and I were in school and when we came home we had such a shock - daddy was there.  He held the pair of us in his arms, hugged us, and ruffled our hair. I think he was excited to see how much we'd grown.\n\n\"We didn't want to know anything about the war, we just wanted to have him home forever, but of course, that wasn't to be.\"\n\nIt was not to be because just a month after his final visit home, Mrs Barron's father was killed in action at the battle of Cambrai in France.\n\nBreakdown fears\n\nUnable to cope alone with her four children, Mrs Barron's mother split up the family.\n\nMrs Barron never lived at home again. \n\nIn 2010, as well as returning to the family home in Blackwood, Mrs Barron was able to visit Bourlon Wood where her father was killed.  She herself died four months later. \n\nAccording to WW1 historian Dr Gerry Oram, Mrs Barron's experience represented wider fears about a breakdown in society.\n\n\"Even at the time the government was extremely worried about the loss of so many fathers,\"he said.\n\n\"But unfortunately their primary concern was about the wider sociological consequences, rather than the impact it had on individual children and families.\n\n\"There was a hue and cry about the lack of disciplinarian father-figures and what was perceived as the resultant rise in juvenile delinquency.  \n\n\"Whether these fears were founded or just a response to the increased press and police attention of WW1, what is termed a moral panic, is still a huge debate in history and criminology.\"\n\nBut while so many needs were left unaddressed, Dr Oram argues the experience of WW1 did bring some tangible benefits for young people.\n\n\"Even in 1914 the guidelines were that children should receive education until they were 14, but in practice there were so many exemptions to this that it was meaningless,\"he said.\n\n\"And with the shortage of labour brought about by war the situation became even worse.\n\n\"When he brought the 1918 Education Act before parliament, chairman of the board of education, H.A.L. Fisher, noted'between the start of the war and 1917, 600,000 children had been put prematurely - yet legally - to work'.  \n\n\"In areas like Wales, with labour-intensive industries, doubtless the situation was even worse. \n\n\"As a result of the act, after 1918 there is a focus on not only education, but also on improving nutrition and health-care through the school system.  \n\n\"But even this was borne of the experience of needing a healthy workforce in order to wage total war, rather than through concern for the individual child.\"\n\nDr Amy Brown, director of child and public health at Swansea University, believes modern examples prove how different life could have been for the children of WW1.\n\n\"The only comparable disasters you can point to in modern times are 9/11 and the tsunami, and for both of those, studies show that the enormous counselling effort which was put in place has enabled the child victims to address their grief and go on to develop as well as could have been expected under the circumstances,\"she said.\n\n\"It would have been a mixed blessing to grow up in somewhere like Wales during WW1.\n\n\"The close-knit community spirit would certainly have helped, but the'stiff upper lip' attitude, along with the fact that so many people were in the same boat, would have discouraged children from talking about it and resolving their feelings.\n\n\"In particular very small children have a tendency to blame themselves, and wrongly associate unrelated events, so unless they're told otherwise they'll feel as though their father died because they were naughty.\"\n\nShe argues that the failure to address individual emotional needs could have had incalculable consequences in the decades which followed.\n\n\"You'd have seen two distinct waves; firstly the older children, whose grief would have struck immediately, and then several years later the children who'd been very young at the time, and whose anger and loss only developed as they grew older.\n\n\"Under those circumstances it would be entirely predictable to see a spike in alcoholism, domestic violence and other crime amongst the cohort in the years that followed.\"\n\n'Lost generation'\n\nDr Oram agrees that, whilst more study is needed in the area, there could indeed be historical evidence to bear this out.\n\n\"We talk of a lost generation in terms of the men who were killed, but it's equally true to think of the next generation having also been lost,\"he said.\n\n\"A generation from broken families, with incomplete educations, tried to grieve as they had the additional responsibility of becoming the bread-winners thrust upon them.\n\n\"There's been little serious research done on the matter, but I'd say it's entirely reasonable to make a case that many of the social ills of the 1920s and 30s which have been blamed on the depression, could also be attributed in part to the aftermath of the unbelievable trauma that generation had lived through as children.\"\nTL;DR: About 35,000 Welshmen gave their lives in battle during World War One, but while they are commemorated each year, the estimated 80,000 children in Wales who were left without

traditional and less traditional types\".\n\nIt adds:\"The applicant seeks to provide both a religious and an ecumenical space in which he, his family and these different people (his guests) can retreat for contemplation or worship in peace and safety from disturbance.\"\n\nSuffolk Coastal District Council is expected to make a decision on the planning application in April.\n\nSheeran was

Conversation, Sir David Bell said Mr Gove should not surround himself with\"yes men\".\n\nMr Gove became embroiled in a row after deciding to replace the chair of Ofsted, Labour's Baroness Sally Morgan.\n\nHe says he wants to\"refresh\"the leadership of the schools' watchdog and denies his intention to remove the Labour peer was politically motivated.\n\nPrivate schools\n\nIn a speech in east London on Monday, Mr Gove is expected to set out his own ambitions for state schools, saying they should be more like independent schools.\n\nHe will call for more testing, in particular encouraging state schools to adopt the common entrance exam - an exam sat by some private school pupils.\n\nMr Gove will also back plans for individual secondary schools to be able to take the OECD's international Pisa tests.\n\nState schools will be able to stay open longer and the education secretary will repeat calls for tougher discipline.\n\nMr Gove will also say that he wants private and state schools to become indistinguishable.\n\n\"For decades, the dominant consensus has been that state education in England was barely satisfactory,\"Mr Gove will say, but that such a\"pessimistic view is no longer tenable\"as state schools have improved.\n\nBut the row over the change at the top of England's schools watchdog has intensified further with the intervention of Sir David, who as well as having served as Ofsted's chief inspector later worked alongside Mr Gove as his most senior civil servant at the Department for Education.\n\n'Cut off'\n\nIn the article for The Conversation academic website, Sir David warns the education secretary of the risk of becoming isolated by listening only to supporters.\n\n\"The day-to-day grind of policy battles, firefighting and political ding-dong can start to cut you off from outside ideas and thinking.\n\n\"The row over Ofsted's leadership shows the importance of retaining and being seen to retain independent voices near the top - not simply'yes men',\"writes Sir David, who is now the vice chancellor of the University of Reading.\n\nSir David said Mr Gove should not dismiss all critics of his education policy but should engage with those offering an\"intelligent critique\".\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Gove said he had appointed Baroness Morgan, and despite the fact he felt she had done a\"fantastic job\"the position needed a\"fresh perspective\".\n\nBaroness Morgan, who has not had her term in office renewed, told the BBC she was the victim of a\"determined effort from Number 10\"to appoint more Tories.\n\nUnions criticised\n\nThe decision has been criticised by the Liberal Democrats and by Labour's shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, who said the\"disappointing\"move was politically motivated.\n\nThe director of the Institute for Government, Peter Riddell, said the decision not to reappoint Baroness Morgan had\"raised some eyebrows\"but there was nothing new about ministerial involvement.\n\nAnother former Ofsted chairwoman, Zenna Atkins, has backed Mr Gove over Baroness Morgan's departure, saying she has\"seen nothing that suggest it's a political move\".\n\nSir David also had tough words about teachers' unions, saying their\"political naivety has been astonishing\".\n\n\"Their barrage of industrial action and knee-jerk opposition to any change has allowed the education secretary and his supporters to characterise them as cartoon-like bogeymen,\"he writes.\n\nSir David was part of a group of business leaders and academics who published a report last week calling for a more independent, non-political approach to education policy.\n\nThe row over Baroness Morgan comes a week after the chief inspector of schools in England, Sir Michael Wilshaw, accused staff at the Department for Education of briefing against his organisation. \n\nSir Michael Wilshaw had said he was\"spitting blood\"after the Times reported two right-leaning think tanks were to criticise Ofsted. \n\nMr Gove denied claims his team briefed against the inspectorate which in turn was welcomed by Sir Michael who said he would defend his team against\"unfair criticism\".\nTL;DR: A former Ofsted chief inspector has warned Education Secretary Michael Gove not \"to believe his own hype\".\n\nArticle: China's foreign ministry said earlier that Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig had been\"indicted and tried\".\n\nHowever, Ottawa said it had since spoken to Beijing, and confirmed the pair's case had not yet gone to court.\n\nThe confusion was caused by\"an inaccurate characterisation\"by China's spokeswoman, they added. \n\nThere has been no public comment from Beijing on the latest development. \n\nMr Spavor and Mr Kovrig were arrested two years ago and formally indicted in June.\n\nTheir detention came shortly after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei, following a request by the US.\n\nMs Meng has been under house arrest in her two Vancouver homes, and is fighting extradition to America. She is charged with lying to American banks about Huawei's alleged dealings with Iran, in violation of US sanctions.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Kovrig - a former diplomat - and businessman Mr Spavor have been held with no access to outside lawyers. They have also had limited opportunities to speak with consular officials or their families.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the two men had been\"arrested, indicted and tried\". This appeared to be confirmation that the two men had been put on trial - and sparked several media reports.\n\nHowever, Canadian diplomats in China indicated they had not been able to confirm with court authorities that a trial had taken place - and several hours later, Canada's foreign ministry told the BBC that it had spoken directly with the foreign ministry and confirmed that\"there has been no development in the cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor\".\n\nIt is not the first time a foreign ministry briefing has sparked confusion. On 1 December, Ms Hua also said that the two men had been\"put... on trial\"- but again, Chinese courts later confirmed that their trials had not taken place, Canadian sources said. \n\nIt is not clear why this confusion appears to have happened twice. A Canadian official told Global News Thursday's confusion sprung from\"a comment that was misinterpreted in a translation error\".\n\nA reminder that Beijing calls the shots\n\nBy Celia Hatton, Asia-Pacific editor, BBC World Service\n\nIn Chinese, the words of the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, were far from clear. But in English, her words appeared unmistakeable: The\"Two Michaels\", as they're commonly known, had been tried. China's state media then widely repeated the claims in both languages. \n\nBut this had already happened. One mistake? That is human. But eyebrows will surely be raised after China's foreign ministry needlessly raised anxieties for a second time. Foreign ministry workers are well educated and the translators there speak flawless English. In my own dealings with Hua Chunying, I've observed that she usually chooses her words very carefully. \n\nSo, could Beijing be up to anything? As the Canadians begin their third year in detention, it's been widely reported that US prosecutors are negotiating a plea deal with the lawyers for Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Perhaps the repeated use of murky language will ratchet up the pressure in Ottawa and Washington, pushing all three sides toward a conclusion. \n\nAt the very least, it reminds us that Beijing can easily put the two men on trial when desired, leaving Canadian diplomats to scramble for clarification. The Michaels have been charged under murky state secrets laws, so any potential prosecution will be behind closed doors. If they do go before a Chinese court, we've all been given a reminder that the outside world might not get any advance notice. \n\nAnother case of cloudy language? Maybe. However, it's painfully clear in these two cases, Beijing calls the shots.\n\nBoth Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor were arrested on 10 December 2018 and interrogated for months before being taken to formal detention facilities. Neither were formally charged until June this year, but could face lengthy prison terms if found guilty.\n\nOn Tuesday Ottawa's ambassador to Beijing, Dominic Barton, said both men were in good physical and mental condition, despite their hardship.\n\nMr Kovrig's employer, Crisis Group, released a statement earlier this week to mark the two-year anniversary of his arrest. The thinktank said it was perplexed by his detention\"since it came after a decade of good and productive engagement with the Chinese authorities.\"\n\nAccording to Crisis Group, Mr Kovrig had frequently met Chinese officials, spoke at conferences and appeared on Chinese media to comment on regional issues.\n\nOver $28,000 has been raised by a crowdfunding campaign in support of Mr Spavor, who has deep ties with North Korea.\n\nHe is a founding member of the Paektu Cultural Exchange, an organisation which facilitates international business and cultural ties with the secretive communist country.\n\nMr Spavor is only one of a handful of Westerners to have met Kim Jong-un, and helped to arrange a meeting between the North Korean leader and former basketball star Dennis Rodman in 2013.\n\nChina has previously denied that their cases are connected to Ms Meng's detention, but it has consistently linked them to its demands that she be released.\nTL;DR: Two Canadians charged with spying in China have not been put on trial, despite earlier reports, Canada's foreign ministry has told the BBC.\n\nArticle: The case has been raised by four of his constituents in Orkney and Shetland.\n\nThey argue he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister.\n\nThe case is due in court next month with more than \u00a360,000 already raised but now more is being sought.\n\nMr Carmichael had initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe said that the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.\n\nThe MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted that the\"details of the account are not correct\".\n\nThe official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo found that Mr Carmichael had given permission to his former special adviser Euan Roddin to hand details of the memo to the newspaper. \n\nCampaigners raised \u00a360,000 in crowd-funding to lodge the legal challenge to his election under the Representation of the People Act 1983.\nTL;DR: The team behind the campaign to overturn the election of Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael has launched a second appeal for funding.\n\nArticle: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor\n\nThe\"premium\"facilities strip ads from the platform's content and allow it to be downloaded rather than just streamed.\n\nThe music service is priced at the same rate as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal's basic service.\n\nHowever, the wider video content - which supersedes YouTube Red - is available only at an additional cost.\n\nIt includes about 65 series - including several exclusives featuring popular YouTube video-creators - with the promise of a new addition on roughly a weekly basis.\n\nHowever, it costs \u00a311.99 a month for individuals or \u00a317.99 for a family plan, which is significantly more than either Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThis may make it a challenging sell to users attracted by the exclusive video content but who are already satisfied with a rival music-streaming service.\n\nOne company executive, however, suggested that what made the proposition compelling was the fact that videos could be played without ads, offline and/or in the background while apps were in use.\n\n\"I'm trying to say to people that it's not a new music subscription or a new Svod [subscription video-on-demand]. It's really YouTube done better, with those additional things thrown in,\"Luke Hyams, European chief of YouTube Originals, told the BBC.\n\nCanada, Ireland, France, Russia and Germany are among the other countries gaining the services.\n\n'It's all here'\n\nYouTube Music Premium works on Android and iOS phones and tablets, as well as Google's Home smart speakers, but not Amazon's Echo devices.\n\nIn time, the plan is for it to replace the existing Google Play Music app.\n\nYouTube's pitch is that\"it's all here\"- a reference to the fact that it hosts live recordings, remixes, covers and mash-ups that are unavailable elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, the company claims to have a superior search facility to those of its rivals, allowing users to find songs even if they provide muddled-up versions of the lyrics.\n\nHowever, none of this is exclusive to the subscription service, so its appeal will in large part rest on users' desire to be able to listen to the songs without an internet connection.\n\nThe Verge review site described YouTube Music Premium as a\"legitimate challenger\"to Apple and Spotify's offerings, when it was launched in the US last month.\n\nHowever, it noted that the lack of a desktop app and the use of location data to provide recommendations might deter some.\n\nYouTube stars\n\nThe video package - called YouTube Premium -  is based on a library of original content produced for the YouTube Red service over the past two years.\n\nUntil now, it had been limited to the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Mexico.\n\nTwo new shows are being launched to coincide with the wider rollout:\n\nYouTube Premium also contains more traditional content, including a follow-up TV series to the 1980s' Karate Kid films, and a spin-off show to 2008's sci-fi movie Jumper.\n\nBut one expert said YouTube's fastest route to building up an exclusive deep library of content would be to call on its homegrown stars.\n\n\"YouTube already has a great network of people producing material for it, and it won't be short of pitches from them,\"said Hannah Bowler, from the trade magazine Broadcast.\n\n\"If it ramps up its commissioning, it could build up a slate of content quite quickly.\"\n\nThe risk, however, is that many of YouTube's most popular creators end up spending most of their time making content for a section of the service unavailable to most of its users, which in turn could make the wider platform less appealing.\nTL;DR: YouTube is expanding its subscription-based music and video services to the UK and a further 11 countries.\n\nArticle: By Angie BrownBBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter\n\nStuart McKenzie has tried a few ingenious solutions to keep his crops on track this year.\n\nHe has taken down gutters to plant seeds and is using the heat from his fridge to grow some of his herbs and vegetables.\n\nStuart is president of the Federation of Edinburgh and District Allotments and Gardens Association.\n\nThe Scottish government's guidance says that councils and allotment owners have the power to decide whether they should remain open.\n\nGardeners have been allowed to work in their allotments in Edinburgh so far, as long as they follow the social distancing advice. But fears that this could change prompted Stuart to rush to his plot a few weeks ago.\n\n'We can't get any more seeds'\n\nNew potatoes are normally planted at Easter, when the soil is warmer, but he said:\"I was worried there would be a lockdown and I would have no crop, so I planted them early.\n\n\"Now I'm worried they will all rot because the ground is too cold.\"\n\nStuart has taken some steps at home in an effort to minimise other potential problems.\n\n\"Mice love it when pea seeds start to swell as they are very sweet, so they sniff them out and dig them up,\"he said.\n\n\"I especially can't let this happen this year because we can't get any more seeds during the lockdown.\n\n\"So I've taken the gutters off my shed to grow them in. I can keep them safely in my shed, away from mice.\"\n\nWhen the time is right, the gutter makes the right shape so he can slide the plants into a furrow in the ground.\n\nStuart has also been growing basil, parsley, swedes, brussels sprouts and cabbage on top of his fridge, where it is warm.\n\nHe has combined this with a grow lamp which provides light to start the plants germinating earlier. He then plans to plant them outside his house, where he can keep an eye on them regardless of any further restrictions.\n\nSeona Robinson, who has a plot at Inverleith Allotments in Edinburgh, said she cried when she discovered mice had eaten all her seeds - and she has been unable to buy any more due to the lockdown.\n\nShe said:\"I'm very organised and only grow what I need, so when this happened I had no more seeds. I wailed, it was grief, it was very tough.\n\n\"I produce all the fruit and vegetables that I eat all summer so I completely rely on having a crop from my allotment.\n\n\"Allotments are challenging, but this lockdown has added an extra difficulty.\"\n\nStewart Dickson, 63, is also a plot holder at Inverleith Allotments.\n\nHe said he had tackled the threat of further restrictions in a different way.\n\nHe said:\"I've been really worried that they are going to say we can't go to our allotments, so I've planted everything into the ground in a week.\n\n\"I've also planted everything 14 days early so I have no idea what will happen.

or are continuing to rise - in some of the 22 areas that are currently in level three.\n\nLevel four restrictions would see the closure of a wide range of premises including non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers, gyms and leisure centres, although schools would remain open. \n\nMs Sturgeon has said that moving to the highest level\"for a limited period in some areas\"could help protect the NHS and pave the way for some easing of restrictions at Christmas.\n\nWhat are the level 4 restrictions?\n\nLevel four is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March.\n\nSocialising would not be allowed in people's homes, but six people from two households could still meet outdoors and there would be no limit on outdoor exercise.\n\nHowever, people would be advised to minimise the number of meetings with people from other households, and to follow social distancing guidance.\n\nThose living under level four restrictions would be advised to avoid any unnecessary travel out of the area, and to keep journeys within the area to an absolute minimum.\n\nThe premises which would close include:\n\nHowever, schools would remain open full-time.\n\nThe Scottish Retail Consortium has warned of the impact that the highest tier of restrictions would have on shops.\n\nDirector David Lonsdale said:\"The scientific evidence indicates retail is a safe environment and closing stores will do little to suppress the virus.\n\n\"However, the economic impacts of forced closure during the Christmas trading period are severe, which is why it should only be a last resort.\"\n\nIn neighbouring East and West Dunbartonshire, council leaders are split over whether a move to level four is now the right thing to do.\n\nAndrew Polson, the Conservative leader of East Dunbartonshire, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme the Scottish government must show\"extreme caution\"because of the impact on businesses and people's mental health.\n\nHe said:\"I know the people of East Dunbartonshire are looking for some relaxation of the restrictions.\n\n\"We should be continuing with the tier system we've got.

This includes \u00a3600,000 of public grants set aside for free mailshots and TV broadcasts. \n\nKatie Ghose, of the Electoral Reform Society, said\"rushing\"to spend \u00a39.3m on the mail drop before stricter rules kicked in could make people feel the government was\"playing fast and loose with the situation\".\n\n'Higher prices' \n\nA similar leaflet to that being issued was sent out by the government during the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence and in the 1975 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Community. \n\nBut in 1975 the leaflet contained a picture and a signed introduction by the then prime minister, Harold Wilson. The latest leaflet does not include any images of David Cameron.\n\nInstead, the leaflet is plain and official-looking, containing pictures of workers, shoppers and families, and concentrating overwhelmingly on what the government sees as the economic case for staying in the EU. \n\nIt claims that\"over three million UK jobs are linked to exports to the EU\"and that\"if the UK voted to leave the EU, the resulting economic shock would risk higher prices of some household goods\".\n\nOfficials described the document as\"a straightforward, sober representation of the government case\", designed both to change voters' minds and encourage others to register to vote. \n\n'Propaganda'\n\nThey said internal opinion polls suggested 85% of people wanted the government to provide more information so they could make an informed decision on 23 June. \n\nEnvironment Secretary Liz Truss said the leaflets would help voters do so. She also emphasised the government's view that EU membership\"brings economic security, peace and stability\". \n\nThe government said the leaflets had cost \u00a3458,500 to produce and \u00a35.94m to print and deliver across the UK. An additional \u00a32.89m had been spent on the accompanying website and\"digital promotion\".\n\nBut the move was met with thinly disguised anger by groups campaigning for EU exit.\n\n\"I think it is deeply disappointing that the government is going to spend taxpayers' money in a bid to distract the media headlines away from the allegations of offshore banks that have dogged the prime minister,\"Robert Oxley, a Vote Leave spokesman, said.\n\n\"Our money should not be used on propaganda, trying to buy votes. We already send \u00a3350m to Brussels each week. We should spend our money on our priorities like the NHS.\"\n\nLondon Mayor Mr Johnson, one of the most senior Conservative politicians to back leaving the EU, said the move was a\"crazy waste of money\". \n\nBoth sides needed to be able to put across their arguments fairly to guarantee an\"informed\"debate, he said.\n\nConservative MP Bernard Jenkin, a prominent supporter of Vote Leave,  said it was\"an outrageous abuse of taxpayers' money\"which\"flies in the face of the government's claim that they want a fair referendum\".\n\n\"In this one act, the government will spend more on their Remain campaign than the official Leave group will be able to spend between now and polling day,\"he said.\n\n'Error of judgement'\n\nConservative MP Peter Bone, from Grassroots Out, said the move was a\"major error of judgement\"by Mr Cameron.\n\n\"The prime minister promised Parliament that no taxpayers' money would be spent promoting Remain or Leave,\"he said. \n\n\"What is being done is immoral, undemocratic and against what the government has promised. If this is not reversed it will seriously damage the prime minister's reputation.\"\n\nBut former immigration minister Damian Green, a Britain Stronger In Europe campaign group board member, said ministers were giving people the information they had been asking for.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight:\"People have been crying out for facts. The government has produced a factual leaflet. Both sides will get a leaflet funded by the Electoral Commission during the actual period itself. That's what's fair.\"\n\nOfficials said it was entirely legitimate for the government to make its case and said there was no legal reason why it could not do so. \n\nThe decision to send the leaflet was agreed by the Cabinet sub-committee on the EU and was signed off by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood. \n\nSpeaking in Parliament last June, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond ruled out sending mail shots during the so-called\"purdah period\"- the last 28 days before the vote when any official government role in the campaign will be banned. \n\nThe government faced a backlash from Conservative MPs last autumn when they sought to relax the rules limiting ministerial activity in the immediate run-up to the poll, only backing down after losing a parliamentary vote.\nTL;DR: The government is spending more than \u00a39m on sending a leaflet to every UK household setting out the case for remaining in the European Union.\n\nArticle: By Greg DunlopBBC News, Sydney\n\nThe animal, also known as a thylacine, was declared extinct 80 years ago.\n\nBut over the decades various people have offered hazy eyewitness accounts and undocumented physical evidence as proof that some are still out there.\n\nThis week, images circulated by a group of amateur enthusiasts was met with both excitement and scepticism.\n\nThe grainy video footage, posted online by the Thylacine Awareness Group, purports to show an animal with a long tail moving through a backyard.\n\nAmateur researcher Neil Waters claims it shows a small thylacine, alive and well in South Australia's Adelaide Hills.\n\nHe has a theory that the carnivorous marsupial may have survived undiscovered on mainland Australia because it is an migratory apex predator which may burrow dens. \n\n\"I first saw it in a book when I was a lad in primary school and it said'presumed extinct' and it sparked something in my mind way back then that's never really gone away,\"he told the BBC.\n\nMr Waters also dismisses the suggestion that the search for the creature enters the realm of cryptozoology.\n\n\"There's plenty of specimens in museums around the world that proves this animal really did exist,\"he said.\n\n\"I guess that gives us one advantage over someone that's looking for Big Foot or a UFO.\"\n\nExperts have roundly debunked the footage, arguing the blurry video does nothing to prove the continuing existence of the thylacine\n\nThey point out that evidence of dead prey should also have been found.\n\nDr Karl Kruszelnicki, a science commentator based at the University of Sydney, said the most surprising thing about the footage was its terrible quality.\n\n\"It's remarkable that it is out of focus in a time that we have autofocus cameras,\"he said. \n\nHis explanation for the perpetuation of the belief unexplained phenomenon is simple.\n\n\"For some people the world around them, they don't understand it, so they have to make stuff up.\"\n\nThe last known Tasmanian tiger died at Hobart zoo in 1936. The species was deliberately hunted to extinction by farmers incensed at the number of sheep killed by the carnivores.\n\nHowever, thousands of sighting have been reported in Tasmania and mainland Australian in the decades since.\n\nIn 2005, The Bulletin magazine offered a A$1.25m (\u00a3700,000; $1m) reward for the capture of a live thylacine. \n\nScientists have even spoken about resurrecting the species through cloning schemes reminiscent of Jurassic Park.\n\nDr Cath Temper, a mammals expert from the South Australian museum, said the latest footage\"could really be anything\".\n\nWhile there is a remote possibility there could be a few survivors in Tasmania, she says, this is unlikely to be the real thing, as\"there's never been a thylacine specimen from the mainland\".\n\n\"But you never know,\"she said.\"It would be arrogant if I said there was no chance.\"\nTL;DR: In the striped and hairy history of the Tasmanian tiger, those who believe the extinct animal has quietly survived have offered up all kinds of evidence.\n\nArticle: By Martin AsserBBC News\n\nHis rule saw him go from revolutionary hero to international pariah, to valued strategic partner and back to pariah again. \n\nGaddafi developed his own political philosophy, writing a book so influential - in the eyes of its author, at least - that it eclipsed anything dreamt up by Plato, Locke or Marx. \n\nHe made countless show-stopping appearances at Arab and international gatherings, standing out not just with his outlandish clothing, but also his blunt speeches and unconventional behaviour.\n\nHe spent his life reinventing himself and his revolution:  one Arab commentator called him the\"Picasso of Middle East politics\", although instead of Blue, Rose or Cubist periods, he had his pan-Arab period, his Islamist period, his pan-African period, and so on. \n\nBut even Gaddafi was not able to withstand the tide of popular feeling that had already swept away his two authoritarian neighbours in a momentous year for the Arab world.\n\nEarly promise\n\nIn the heady days of 1969 - when he seized power in a bloodless military coup - and the early 1970s, Muammar Gaddafi was a handsome and charismatic young army officer. \n\nAn eager disciple of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt (he even adopted the same military rank, promoting himself from captain to colonel after the coup), Gaddafi first set about tackling the unfair economic legacy of foreign domination. \n\nFor Nasser, it was the Suez Canal. For Gaddafi, it was oil. \n\nSignificant reserves had been discovered in Libya in the late 1950s, but the extraction was controlled by foreign petroleum companies, which set prices to the advantage of their own domestic consumers and benefited from a half share in the revenue. \n\nGaddafi demanded renegotiation of the contracts, threatening to shut off production if the oil companies refused. \n\nHe memorably challenged foreign oil executives by telling them\"people who have lived without oil for 5,000 years can live without it again for a few years in order to attain their legitimate rights\".\n\nThe gambit succeeded and Libya became the first developing country to secure a majority share of the revenues from its own oil production. Other nations soon followed this precedent and the 1970s Arab petro-boom began. \n\nLibya was in a prime position to reap the benefits. With production levels matching the Gulf states, and one of the smallest populations in Africa (less than 3m at the time), the black gold made it rich quickly. \n\nPolitical theorist\n\nRather than persevering with the doctrines of Arab Nationalism, or following the glittering excesses of Gulf consumerism,  Gaddafi's innately mercurial character led him and Libya on a new path. \n\nBorn to nomadic Bedouin parents in 1942, Muammar Gaddafi was certainly an intelligent, resourceful man, but he did not receive a thorough education, apart from learning to read the Koran and his military training. \n\nNevertheless, in the early 1970s he set out to prove himself a leading political philosopher, developing something called the third universal theory, outlined in his famous Green Book.\n\nThe theory claims to solve the contradictions inherent in capitalism and communism (the first and second theories), in order to put the world on a path of political, economic and social revolution and set oppressed peoples free everywhere.\n\nIn fact, it is little more than a series of fatuous diatribes, and it is bitterly ironic that a text whose professed objective is to break the shackles imposed by the vested interests dominating political systems was used instead to subjugate an entire population. \n\nThe result of Gaddafi's theory, underlined with absolute intolerance of dissent or alternative voices, was the hollowing out of Libyan society, with all vestiges of constitutionality, civil society and authentic political participation eradicated. \n\nThe solution to society's woes, the book maintains, is not electoral representation - described by Gaddafi as\"dictatorship\"by the biggest party - or any other existing political system, but the establishment of people's committees to run all aspects of existence. \n\nThis new system is presented diagrammatically in the Green Book as an elegant wagon wheel, with basic popular congresses around the rim electing people's committees that send influence along the spokes to a responsive and truly democratic people's general secretariat at the centre.\n\nThe model that was created in reality was an ultra-hierarchical pyramid - with the Gaddafi family and close allies at the top wielding power unchecked, protected by a brutal security apparatus. \n\nIn the parallel world of the Green Book, the system is called a Jamahiriyya - a neologism that plays on the Arabic word for a republic, Jumhuriyya, implying\"rule by the masses\".\n\nSo the long-suffering Libyan masses were dragooned into attending popular congresses vested with no power, authority or budgets, with the knowledge that anyone who spoke out of turn and criticised the regime could be carted off to prison. \n\nA set of draconian laws was enacted in the name of upholding security, further undermining the colonel's claim to a champion of freedom from oppression and dictatorship.\n\nLegal penalties included collective punishment, death for anyone who spread theories aiming to change the constitution and life imprisonment for disseminating information that tarnished the country's reputation.\n\nTales abounded of torture, lengthy jail terms without a fair trial, executions and disappearances. Many of Libya's most educated and qualified citizens chose exile, rather than pay lip service to the lunacy. \n\nAdventures abroad\n\nUnchecked by any of the normal restraints of governance, Gaddafi was able to take his anti-imperialist campaign around the world, funding and supporting militant groups and resistance movements wherever he found them. \n\nHe also targeted Libyan exiles, dozens of whom were killed by assassins believed to belong to a global Libyan intelligence network. \n\nIf governments were prepared to shrug off Gaddafi's human rights violations in Libya, and persecution of dissidents abroad, it was a different matter when it came to him supporting groups that used terrorism on their own patches. \n\nA bombing of a nightclub used by US soldiers in Berlin in 1986, blamed on Libyan agents, proved a decisive moment. \n\nUS President Ronald Reagan ordered air strikes against Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for the two soldiers and one civilian killed and the dozens of wounded, although there was no conclusive proof beyond intelligence\"chatter\"that Libya had ordered the attack. \n\nThe US retaliation was intended to kill the\"mad dog of the Middle East\", as Mr Reagan branded him, but although there was extensive damage and an unknown number of Libyan fatalities - including, it was claimed, Gaddafi's adopted daughter - the colonel emerged unscathed. \n\nHis reputation may even have been enhanced among opponents of Washington's heavy-handed foreign policy. \n\nThe bombing of Pan-Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988 was the next significant escalation, causing the deaths of 270 people in the air and on the ground, the worst single act of terrorism ever witnessed in the UK.\n\nGaddafi's initial refusal to hand over the two Libyan suspects to Scottish jurisdiction resulted in a protracted period of negotiations and UN sanctions, finally ending in 1999 with their surrender and trial. One of the men, Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, was jailed for life, but the other was found not guilty. \n\nA new detente\n\nThe resolution of the Lockerbie case, along with Gaddafi's subsequent admission and renunciation of a covert nuclear and chemical weapons programme, paved the way for a significant warming of relations between Tripoli and western powers in the 21st century. \n\nThe domestication of the erstwhile\"mad dog\"was held up as one of the few positive results of US President George W Bush's military invasion of Iraq in 2003. \n\nThe argument went that Gaddafi had watched the fate of fellow miscreant Saddam Hussein, hanged by Iraqis after a US-instigated legal process, and had learnt a sobering lesson.\n\nIt is perhaps more plausible to argue that the Libyan leader played his WMD card when he saw the benefits of forging strategic partnerships with the US and European powers.\n\nHe certainly paid little heed to Mr Bush's so-called\"freedom agenda\", which held that the US no longer held common cause with dictators and despots and that democracy and human rights were just around the corner.\n\nIt was after all more or less business as usual between Washington and the other authoritarian Arab rulers whom the US called friends and allies. \n\nWith international sanctions lifted, Tripoli was back on the international political itinerary, allowing British Prime Minister Tony Blair, among other luminaries, to drop in at Gaddafi's famously luxurious Bedouin tent erected in his palace grounds. \n\nIn true nomadic style, the tent also went with the colonel on trips to Europe and the US, although in New York state it fell foul of stringent zoning regulations on the estate of tycoon Donald Trump and had to be hastily dismantled.\n\nDistaste about the alleged architect of Lockerbie's readmission into the world leaders' club lingered in many circles, not least among the US victims' families and their supporters. \n\nBut that did not stop business deals being struck with a succession of western defence manufacturers and oil firms.\n\nIronically, it was on the Arab front that Gaddafi kept his black sheep status alive. \n\nThroughout the 2000s, the normally staid proceedings of annual summits of the Arab League were almost guaranteed to be disrupted by the Libyan leader's antics, whether it was lighting up a cigarette and blowing smoke into the face of his neighbour, or tossing insults at Gulf rulers and the Palestinians, or declaring himself\"king of kings of Africa\". \n\nThe UN has also witnessed the colonel's eccentricity. At the 2009 General Assembly, he gave a rambling speech more than an hour-and-a-quarter longer than his allocated 10-minute time slot, tearing out and screwing up pages from the UN Charter as he spoke. \n\nRebellion\n\nWhen the winds of revolt started to blow through the Arab world from Tunisia in December 2010, Libya was not at the top of most people's list of\"who's next\". \n\nGaddafi fitted the bill as an authoritarian ruler who had endured for more years than the vast majority of his citizens could remember. But he was not so widely perceived as a western lackey as other Arab leaders, accused of putting outside interests before the interests of their own people.\n\nHe had redistributed wealth - although the enrichment of his own family from oil revenues and other deals was hard to ignore and redistribution was undertaken more in the spirit of buying loyalty than promoting equality. \n\nHe sponsored grand public works, such as the improbable Great Man-Made River project, a massive endeavour inspired, perhaps, by ancient Bedouin water procurement techniques, that brought sweet, fresh water from aquifers in the south to the arid north of his country. \n\nThere was even something of a Tripoli Spring, with long-term exiles given to understand that they could return without facing persecution or jail. \n\nWhen the first calls for a Libyan\"day of rage\"were circulated, Gaddafi pledged - apparently in all seriousness - to protest with the people, in keeping with his myth of being the\"brother leader of the revolution\"who had long ago relinquished power to the people.\n\nAs it turned out, the scent of freedom and the draw of possibly toppling the colonel, just as Egypt's Mubarak and Tunisia's Ben Ali had been toppled, was too strong to resist among parts of the Libyan population, especially in the east. \n\nSome of the first footage of rebellion to come out of Benghazi showed incensed young Libyans outside an official building smashing up a green monolith representing the spurious liberation doctrine that had kept them enslaved since the 1970s - the Green Book. \n\nAs the uprising spread, and the seriousness of the threat to his rule became apparent, Gaddafi showed he had lost none of the ruthlessness directed against dissidents and exiles in the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nThis time it was turned on whole towns and cities where people had dared to tear down his posters and call for his downfall. Regular troops and mercenaries nearly overwhelmed the rag-tag rebels, consisting of military deserters and ill-trained militiamen brought together under the banner of the National Transitional Council (NTC). The colonel could afford to dismiss them as wayward 17-year-olds,\"given pills at night, hallucinatory pills in their drinks, their milk, their coffee, their Nescafe\".\n\nThe intervention of Nato on the rebels' side in March, authorised by a UN resolution calling for the protection of civilians, prevented their seemingly imminent annihilation - but it was months before they could turn the situation to their advantage. \n\nThen came the fall of Tripoli and Gaddafi went into hiding, still claiming his people were behind him and promising success against the\"occupiers\"and\"collaborators\". His dictatorial regime had finally crumbled, but many feared that he might remain at large to orchestrate an insurgency. \n\nHe met his ignominious and grisly end, when NTC forces found him hiding in a tunnel following a Nato air strike on his convoy as he tried to make a break from his last stronghold, the city of Sirte, where it had all begun.\n\nThe exact circumstances of his death remain in dispute, either\"killed in crossfire\", summarily executed, or lynched and dragged through the streets by jubilant, battle-hardened fighters.  \n\nThough it meant the Libyan people - and other victims around the world - were robbed of proper justice, the news sparked wild celebrations across his former domain that nearly 42 years of rule and misrule had truly come to a close.\nTL;DR: How can you adequately describe someone like Col Muammar Gaddafi? During a period that spanned six decades, the Libyan leader paraded on the world stage with a style so unique and unpredictable that the words \"maverick\" or \"eccentric\" scarcely did him justice.\n\nArticle: The Supreme Court found that parts of the legislation relating to information sharing breached human rights rules.\n\nEducation Secretary John Swinney said the policy will still be implemented once changes have been made.\n\nOpponents of the scheme have called for a complete re-think of the plans.\n\nA panel of five judges at the Supreme Court upheld a legal challenge to the legislation, part of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, from the No to Named Persons campaign group.\n\nThey argue that the system, which would provide a named person for every child in Scotland, usually a teacher or health visitor, intrudes on privacy and family life.\n\nThe court ruled that while the aim of the scheme was\"unquestionably legitimate and benign\", the data-sharing practices currently legislated for made it\"perfectly possible\"for confidential information about a young person to be shared with\"a wide range of public authorities without either the child or her parents being aware\". \n\nJudges said this is\"incompatible with the rights of children, young persons and parents\"under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe scheme was meant to be rolled out across Scotland on 31 August, but the Scottish government is\"urgently\"drafting an order to cancel this, to provide time for changes to be made to the legislation after Holyrood returns from recess in September.\n\nThe Lib Dems had called for parliament to be recalled over the matter, but this was rejected by Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh, who said the most pressing matter - the government's order postponing the implementation of the policy - did not need parliament to be sitting.\n\nMr Swinney said he had already held talks with\"senior figures from the public and third sectors\", including the NHS, councils and Police Scotland.\n\nThe Deputy First Minister said:\"Our aim has always been for the named person to provide timely support for children and families. We have always said that as part of that role, we expect that any sharing of personal information should be proportionate and relevant.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's ruling makes clear that while the principle of providing a named person for each child does not breach human rights, we need to do further work to ensure those performing the role have greater clarity about sharing information, as required by the court.\"\n\nA number of Scottish councils are currently running pilot versions of the Named Person scheme.\n\nOpponents have claimed this could leave these councils open to legal challenges from parents about the data-sharing practices used, but Mr Swinney insisted in a letter to Holyrood's education committee that existing procedures are not affected by the ruling.\n\n'Utterly negligent'\n\nThe No to Named Persons group said the government would now have to come up with a\"much more limited scheme\"which\"actually respects the rights of children and parents\".\n\nAnd spokesman Simon Calvert said he hoped the system was scrapped entirely.\n\nHe said:\"The decision by the judges is a devastating critique of this fatally flawed flagship legislation. It is holed below the water line - let us hope it sinks without trace.\"\n\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the government needed to\"go right back to the starting block\"with the legislation, saying they had\"lost the support of the majority of parents across Scotland\".\n\nShe said the government would\"face a heavy reckoning from Scottish parents who rightly want to be able to raise their children without state interference\"if it went ahead with the plans as they stand.\n\nAnd Tory education spokeswoman Liz Smith said it was clear that the scheme was\"unworkable and unnecessary\".\n\nShe said:\"The Supreme Court has blown the named persons scheme out of the water and it's time that the SNP realised that it's time to stop pursuing it.\n\n\"Instead of arrogantly trying to push ahead, they should listen to the many voices who are saying that this policy is unworkable and unnecessary.

The bilingual school in Zehlendorf teaches German and American children.\n\nReports say one bully blew e-cigarette smoke in the boy's face, saying\"that should remind you of your forefathers\"- a sarcastic reference to the Holocaust. \n\nBullies also reportedly drew swastikas on post-it notes and stuck them on the boy's back. \n\nRead more on this topic:\n\nBefore 1989, Germany's Jewish minority numbered below 30,000. But an influx of Jews, mainly from the former Soviet Union, has raised the number to more than 200,000.\n\nHow bad is anti-Semitism in Germany?\n\nBerlin's Anti-Semitism Research and Information Office (RIAS) says anti-Semitism is expressed on various levels, and not only by neo-Nazis, or by Muslim extremists who hate Israel.\n\n\"There is overall a worrying development of anti-Semitism becoming more socially acceptable. It has grown over the last couple of years and many cases go unreported,\"researcher Alexander Rasumny at RIAS told the BBC.\n\nRIAS documented 947 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, including 18 physical attacks, compared with 590 in 2016. The watchdog's annual report (in German) said the increase was partly a result of more Germans reporting such incidents to RIAS, having learnt of its work. \n\nIn an interview (in German) with the daily Der Tagesspiegel, the German government's new anti-Semitism tsar, Felix Klein, spoke of\"a brutalised climate now, in which more people feel emboldened to say anti-Semitic things on the internet and in the street\".\"Previously that was unthinkable, but the threshold has dropped.\"\n\nWhat other incidents have hit the headlines?\n\nIn April two young men wearing traditional Jewish skullcaps (kippahs) were assaulted in Berlin. The attacker, a 19-year-old migrant from Syria, was filmed shouting anti-Semitic abuse. \n\nLater Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, advised Jews to avoid wearing kippahs. But in solidarity, thousands of Berliners wore kippahs on 29 April, declared an\"action day\"against anti-Semitism. \n\nTwo German rappers, Kollegah and Farid Bang, were investigated recently over their gangsta rap lyrics which referred insultingly to Auschwitz victims and the Holocaust.\n\nThey were not prosecuted, but were taken on an educational visit to Auschwitz, where the Nazis murdered an estimated 1.1m Jews during World War Two.\n\nRhetoric from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has fuelled concern about anti-Semitism. An AfD leader, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, drew strong criticism after he condemned Berlin's Holocaust memorial.\n\nWhy this focus now on schools?\n\nMr Schuster says schools must take anti-Semitism seriously and not sweep it under the carpet.\n\n\"Such incidents happen in all types of school and all over Germany,\"he warned.\n\nOne boy subjected to anti-Semitic taunts at a Berlin school was given a separate room to use during breaks, as well as a separate entrance, RIAS reported.\n\nAnother Jewish boy was removed from a school by his parents after a gang had tormented him for months and threatened him with a realistic-looking toy pistol.\n\nMr Rasumny told the BBC that anti-bullying action had to involve awareness training for teachers, because\"they don't always recognise current forms of anti-Semitism, or know when and how they should intervene\".\n\nThere have been cases of anti-Semitism even among kindergarten children.\n\nThere is much under-reporting of incidents in schools, Mr Rasumny said.\"There is pressure to conform to the rules, not to be different, and often kids report bullying only if they can't stand it any more,\"he said.\n\nIn one case, he said, a Jewish music teacher had left a school after being told by a pupil there that\"God wants Jews to die\". It emerged that another teacher had said something similar to the child's mother. \n\nGerman schools should teach children about Jewish history and culture as a whole, Mr Rasumny said, in order to tackle anti-Semitism.\"It's very important to educate about the Holocaust, but German Jewish history did not just start in 1933 and end in 1945,\"he said.\nTL;DR: The German government plans to send 170 anti-bullying experts into schools after the summer break to tackle anti-Semitism among children.\n\nArticle: Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter\n\nOne of the absolutely core issues in assessing the government's early performance in combating the pandemic, is whether it left it too late to impose the lockdown. \n\nScientists involved in pandemic planning have pinpointed a specific error - that it was too reliant on existing mathematic modelling of the pandemic based on influenza. They say it had not accounted for the fact that coronavirus was a different virus.\n\nThis had two principal vital differences. \n\nCoronavirus is far more contagious than the influenza models, and, unlike flu, there are no approved existing vaccines or treatments. \n\nThis rendered the available pandemic stockpiles of treatments and pre-purchase of tens of millions of vaccines unusable. So only testing, tracing, or forms of social distancing and lockdown were going to work.\n\nSo for the PM's chief adviser to claim, in the middle of his defence,\"only last year I wrote explicitly about the danger of coronaviruses\"is worthy of some inspection. Such prescience would indeed have been impressive and helpful, and he does have a long-standing and well-known interest in mathematical modelling and big data.\n\nLooking at his blog, there is one reference to coronavirus, and it was indeed in a blog written in March last year. But it wasn't quite as billed. It is a blog about the risk of a pandemic starting from a leak from a biological lab. \n\nThe point of it is that governments should pay money to\"Red Teams\"to try to break security at such institutions, including \u00a31m to\"honey trap\"the security bosses. \n\nIf this is the writing that\"explicitly\"warned of the danger of coronaviruses, then it rather suggests that a key No 10 figure believes that biolab security is the relevant issue.\n\nBut then things get even stranger.\n\nMystery\n\nThe internet archive Wayback Machine, which tracks the changing versions of publicly available websites, shows that the blog was edited some time between 9 April and 3 May this year (after the pandemic started) to insert the reference to coronavirus and Chinese labs. This was first pointed out by a data scientist Jens Wiechers on social media, and can be seen here. \n\nIt is in the form of a new quote from an article already linked to in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. It was not in the original blog.\n\nAnd the sitemap of Mr Cumming's blog corroborates this, showing that this post was indeed edited at 20:55:20 on the evening of 14 April this year, still available here. This happens to be the day Mr Cummings returned to work from his Durham trip.\n\nIt is a mystery why he felt the need to burnish his credentials as a coronavirus sage so much that he pointed to having explicitly warned about something that was only added to his blog after the event. \n\nThere is no other reference to coronavirus or Sars or Mers on his blog. There is a page on the mathematics of pandemic modelling and\"herd immunity\"in a long essay written on the education system in 2013, but no references to coronaviruses.\n\nIt is difficult to see why editing a year-old personal blog would have been on any list of priorities for any No 10 official on a day like that - in the middle of the period where hospital deaths had peaked the previous week, but care home deaths were still mounting. \n\nBut Mr Cummings clearly felt the need on Monday to point to examples of prescience on this specific issue. \n\nThe context of his quote on coronavirus was to help disprove the allegation, first made in the Sunday Times, that he had backed a so-called\"herd immunity\"strategy.\n\nI've asked No 10 for a response on the change to his blog, the reference to Chinese biolabs, and whether he stands by the idea he explicitly wrote about the dangers of coronaviruses. \n\nA source acknowledged that the blog was updated and pointed to the fact that the original blog from last year linked to the separate article [in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists] which did discuss coronaviruses.\nTL;DR: Of the many details about travel plans, eye tests, and drives made at Dominic Cummings's Rose Garden press conference on Monday, one thing stood out to me that does matter, and will matter well beyond the future of one adviser.\n\nArticle: By Andrew PickenBBC Scotland News\n\nPentland Medical Centre near Edinburgh was among the first GP practices to start vaccinating the over-80s with a wider rollout starting on 11 January.\n\nBy the end of the programme everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will have been offered a Covid vaccination.\n\nMore than 1,100 locations will be used for the unprecedented NHS initiative.  \n\n GP surgeries\n\nThe majority of people are likely to get their Covid jab at their local medical practice, although acute and community hospitals also appear on the Scottish government's list of vaccination locations. \n\nThis includes the Louisa Jordan coronavirus hospital in Glasgow.\n\nThe Scottish government has modelled a\"likely workforce requirement\"of about 1,400 vaccinators with 600 support staff for the programme but those administering the vaccines will not just be GPs or nurses. \n\nHundreds of other NHS workers, including dentists and optometrists, have signed up to help out. \n\nScores of community centres and village halls across the country have also been earmarked as vaccination hubs. \n\nBut more unconventional locations are also on the NHS list, including a former Topps Tiles shop in Elgin as well as a warehouse and two churches in Orkney.\n\nTwo events spaces, Motherwell Concert Hall and The Event Complex Aberdeen, are also being considered for use as vaccine centres.  \n\nSports centres\n\nA number of popular sports centres are also on the Scottish government's list of vaccination centres to be used once the programme is fully up and running. \n\nIn the south west of the country this includes Lockerbie Ice Rink and the Palmerston Park stadium belonging to Scottish Championship club Queen of the South. \n\nElsewhere, Dunfermline Athletic's East End Park and the Dewars ice rink centre in Perth are also on the vaccination centre list. \n\nIn addition, the Time Capsule in Coatbridge is one of the leisure centres being used.\nTL;DR: The much anticipated community rollout of coronavirus vaccines is under way with an army of  vaccinators ready to issue jabs.\n\nArticle: By De'Graft MensahNewsbeat reporter\n\nThe image is of a man eating a burrito in what is quite possibly the least conventional way to eat a rice-filled Mexican wrap.\n\nAnd no doubt adding to the confusion is one big question: is that Justin Bieber? \n\nThe stranger in question looks scarily like the singer, but has his face somewhat hidden. \n\nWhether it's Bieber or not is a debate lots of people are having.\n\nBut what there's less argument about is this alternative way to eat a burrito. \n\nPeople compared the mystery man's technique to that of an instrument.\n\nAlthough maybe he's on to something - maybe this is the future?\n\nIf you've got this far and are wondering what all the fuss is about, we're worried for you: burritos are obviously eaten upright, right?\n\nThis isn't a one-off case. \n\nWe all have our own special ways to eat certain foods apparently.

Surely they're not controversial? Oh how wrong you are.\n\nIn a 2010 interview Radio 1's Matt Edmondson got into a debate with grime artist Skepta over what the correct way to eat a banana is. \n\nSkepta was convinced that the proper way is to hold the fruit at the bottom and peel from there.\n\nBut Matt was trying to convince the rapper that he probably wasn't eating it in the most efficient of ways.\n\nAlthough there is no official way to eat a banana, Skepta's way is definitely less conventional.\n\nChocolates \n\nIt's not just the celebs with what some would call\"different\"ways of eating. \n\nHow would you eat a Kit Kat? Most people would snap each finger off one at a time. \n\nBut one Twitter user's boyfriend took things to a level they did not need to be taken to.\n\nStringed cheese\n\nBiting straight into things seems to be a regular theme.\n\nThe easiest - and most fun - way to eat cheese strings is surely to peel off the strands of cheese? Isn't the clue in the name?\n\nOnce again, it seems like you are wrong.\n\nPizza\n\nOh, the age old debate. Do you eat pizza with a knife and fork, or do you stick with your hands?\n\nEating with your hands is definitely easier, but you also avoid crumbs with a knife and fork.\n\nBut this Twitter user has introduced a new question to the debate: sliced or whole?\n\nLook, the most important way to eat your food is to just eat it. We get it. \n\nBut there are definitely some unwritten rules around food - which following the burrito incident somebody has actually written - and with these rules there are two types of people.\n\nThose who abide by the rules and those who really, really break them.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.\nTL;DR: A picture of a burrito has gone viral.

By Douglas FraserBusiness and economy editor, Scotland\n\nPhoenix Group, which last year took over much of Standard Life, has announced a tie-up with a software, technology and outsourcing company.\n\nThe deal will see many of its workers transfer to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).\n\nTCS is a global company based in Mumbai.\n\nIt already has a presence in Edinburgh and will drive much of the change in selling and handling workplace pensions for Phoenix.\n\nThe company did not say how many staff will transfer, except to say that the majority of the 3,000 jobs in the city will be retained.\n\nThose transferring from Phoenix to TCS will do so on existing pay and employment terms, and will be part of the TCS subsidiary Diligenta.\n\nHowever, when pressed, a spokeswoman said the reduction in payroll could be\"around the mid-hundreds\"over the next three years, while the company will try to minimise compulsory redundancies. \n\nWhile much of that reduction could be achieved by not replacing departing workers, it would still be a blow to the Edinburgh economy.

The condition affects the way people communicate with others and how they experience the world around them. \n\nAccording to the National Autistic Society, more than one in 100 people are autistic and about 90,000 people in London are on the autism spectrum. \n\nIt is known as a spectrum disorder because it affects people in different ways. There is no known cure. \n\nThe researcher used the false name Jordan.\n\nIn the first of Jordan's sessions, he was ordered to make prolonged eye contact with Mr Kanta, something many autistic people struggle with. \n\nMr Kanta then began to taunt Jordan by telling him repeatedly his mother did not love him.\n\nAs the sessions went on the treatment became more confrontational with shouting.\n\nJordan said afterwards:\"His hands were getting closer to my face, his body was getting closer to me, his face was getting closer to my face.\"\n\nMr Kanta was recorded as saying to him:\"I'll go and slap you\u2026 you want I slap you?... or you want I punch you? Which one do you want?\"\n\nRichard Mills, research director at the Research Autism charity, analysed the BBC's footage.\n\nHe said:\"It has no place under the heading of therapy of any kind.\"\n\nMr Mills said people with autism were likely to find such interaction extremely stressful.\n\n\"To be confronted by someone who is so threatening is horrifying, it's terrifying. \n\n\"And to someone prone to stress and anxiety, the effects are likely to be catastrophic,\"he said.\n\nThe danger of unregulated treatment was the lack of safeguards, Mr Mills added.\n\nZoltan Toth of Stabil Pont Technologia claims to have pioneered the training system in Hungary.\n\nWhen the BBC first approached Mr Toth, posing as a parent with an autistic child, he said:\"I can kill autism, the first that did.\" \n\nMr Toth put the BBC in contact with Mr Kanta who he said was Stabil Pont Technologia's trainer in London.\n\nMr Kanta originally said he was in contact with other families with autism in the UK who were seeking treatment.\n\nHowever, he later denied offering the training to anyone in the UK. \n\nWhen the BBC approached Mr Kanta, he said the techniques used in Hungary, were\"not a treatment or cure. It is training. We do not train or cure anybody.\"\n\nHe also said the firm had experienced\"plenty of results\"and the system was based on science.\n\nWhen asked to explain the abuse shown in the BBC's recording, he said he had been playing\"a joke\". \n\nWhen the BBC later approached Mr Toth for an explanation he said the technique\"helps autistic people to become fully independent, normal people\". \n\nMore than 51,000 people have signed a petition calling for the government to legislate against unproven treatments being marketed as autism cures.\n\nFiona O'Leary, of the campaign group Autistic Rights Together, who has autism herself, said:\"Leading government bodies seem to have little appetite for tackling unregulated and abusive autism'treatments'. \n\n\"Effective legislation is desperately needed to protect autistic people from an industry that allows them to be experimented on with bogus therapies.\"\n\nThe Department of Health said laws already existed in this area and people should report concerns to Trading Standards via Citizens Advice. \n\nA spokesman told the BBC:\"We are determined to help people with autism live full and independent lives and have set out a clear, cross-government programme of action, developed with people with autism, their families and carers, to help achieve this.\"\n\nBBC Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One in the London region on Monday 26 September at 19:30 BST and nationwide on iPlayer for seven days following transmission.\nTL;DR: \"Horrifying\" practices have been exposed that purport to cure people with autism, during which clients are subjected to shouting and intimidation.\n\nArticle: By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter\n\nAlongside the likes of Little Simz and Lady Leshurr, she's part of a groundswell of female voices in the male-dominated world of UK hip-hop and grime.\n\nTwo years ago, the 23-year-old was studying for a degree while working 12-hour shifts in a betting shop to make ends meet.\n\nShe would scribble down lyrics in her spare time as her male contemporaries - Section Boyz, Bonkaz and her cousin Stormzy - were starting to break through. Realising the job was holding her back, she packed it in and started to make her name with her savage, witty lyrics and sense of fun.\n\nHer breakthrough video, Station, was shot, without permission, at a local railway station, with Nadia dancing nonchalantly on the tracks as a train pulled in.\n\nMore recently, the colourful, funky single Skwod saw the rapper take over the streets of London with a girl gang, complete with body-popping Beyonce choreography and all.\n\nShe spoke to the BBC about her upbringing in Croydon, the rappers she looks up to, and why she read the dictionary as a child.\n\nBBC Sound of 2017: The Top Five\n\n5.Nadia Rose\n\n4.Jorja Smith\n\n3. Raye\n\n2. Rag'N' Bone Man\n\n1. Ray BLK\n\nFor people who haven't heard you, describe what they're missing.\n\nMy sound is just really bassy, hard-hitting, dancehall, hip-hop infused fun. I call it magic.\n\nAnd funny, too. Your lyrics have proper punchlines.\n\nYeah, quite a few!\n\nDo you work hard on them?\n\nIt varies, depending on what it is I'm creating. A lot of the time I don't even write the bars. It's all in my head, really. \n\nApparently you used to read the dictionary as a child?\n\nThat is true, yeah! \n\nWhat's your favourite word?\n\nAntidisestablishmentarianism. It's one of the longest words in the English language.\n\nHave you ever tried to get it into a song?\n\nI've been asked and I'm definitely working on it! It might not fit on a single cover, but it could definitely fit in a lyric.\n\nWhat triggered your interest in words?\n\nIt was learning about synonyms that did it for me. I was like,\"Wow, you can use another word to mean the same thing as this word?\"It just went crazy from there. \n\nWhen did you first perform in public?\n\nOoh\u2026 The first time I performed in public? To be fair, growing up I was always performing. It didn't have to be on a stage. It could be a family event and I would just make it about me, somehow. I would perform anywhere. Going up in a lift, on the side of a road, wherever. \n\nOne of your teachers said you were the most entertaining pupil she ever had.\n\nYeah, that was touching\u2026 And actually, I do agree.\n\nThere's a fine line between\"entertaining\"and\"troublemaker\". How often did you end up on the wrong side?\n\nHa ha! Some days it did tip over into what some teachers would call\"disruptive\". But I thought it was creative.\n\nWhat did you study at university?\n\nMusic and music management. It was very helpful when signing my deal - because there were things I definitely wouldn't have had a clue about prior to taking that course. \n\nAt the same time as studying, you were working at a betting shop and making music in your spare time. Did you get any sleep?\n\nNah, barely. All my free time was up in the studio. I just had a feeling I was giving music my spare time, rather than my time. It got to a point where it felt very weird and I thought,\"This is all the wrong way round. I'm getting too comfortable at work and keeping music as a little side thing.\"\n\nI needed to give it my all to actually get the results that I wanted.\n\nYour dad was an MC too. How instrumental was he in your musical education?\n\nHe played a huge part in all of this. He had quite an eclectic music taste, but there was loads of Sizzla, Buju Banton, a lot of the old-school reggae guys. That's where that part of my musical personality comes from.\n\nWho were the MCs you listened to growing up?\n\nIn terms of MCs and rappers, it was definitely a lot of the hip-hop legends, like Busta, Eminem, Missy, Lil Kim. But I wasn't just inspired by MCs. I was a huge Spice Girls fan, too.\n\nWhich one were you?\n\nThey called me Wavey Spice! [Wavey is London slang for cool/good.]\n\nThere weren't many female MCs in the UK to look up to.\n\nWell, there was Ms Dynamite. Seeing what she was able to achieve was inspiring.\n\nHow do you feel about the current wave of female MCs? \n\nIt's a good time and hopefully it'll continue to build.\n\nWhy do you think it's happening now?\n\nProbably me! I bringing them with me!\n\nI saw a freestyle you recorded for SB:TV where you said you'd been told to\"get naked and wear thongs\"to sell records. Was that based on real experience?\n\nIt's from personal experience as well as people that have told me stories. As women in this male-dominated field, we've all been approached with something along those lines at one point. It happens, but we have to be able to overcome it.\n\nI need to ask about the video to Station... I was worried you might die on the train tracks.\n\nA few people were, including my mum.\n\nHow dangerous was it?\n\nIt was literally by chance that we survived. There was no real planning. We didn't even get permission. \n\nRecently I found out we got the train times wrong. The train that would have been coming on the other side was actually due at the time we got off the tracks\u2026 We thought we had a good five minutes spare, but we had seconds.\n\nNetwork Rail has asked the BBC to point out that, while they applaud Nadia Rose on her success, they were concerned to see her music video set on the working railway. \n\nA spokesperson said:\"Trespassing on the railway is highly dangerous and can maim or kill you. As the operator of the railway, Network Rail has a responsibility for keeping passengers and visitors safe and we take these responsibilities very seriously. No one wants to stop people from having innocent fun but they should do so safely without putting their lives at risk.\"\n\nThe other notable thing about that video, and Skwod too, is how much charisma you have. Were you always a natural in front of the camera?\n\nYeah, basically. I'm in my element. I'm doing the thing I love and I'm being able to share that with people.\n\nThis summer, you got to go to Rio for a grime showcase at the British embassy. What was that like? \n\nThat was amazing. I loved Rio. Just to be part of the Olympics was extra-special, again with my squad. I look forward to going again.\n\nYou'd expect the British embassy to choose something more boring, like Sting...\n\nWell, I'm actually a huge Sting fan. I wouldn't call him boring, but I get what you mean. It was definitely good to bring my sound over there. \n\nSo what's your plan for 2017?\n\nIt's going to be filled with a lot of music, a lot of visuals. If you thought this year was the Nadia Rose takeover, you have no idea!\n\nWhat's your biggest ambition?\n\nI definitely need a Grammy under me belt. One at least. At the very least.

The critics wagged their heads. \n\n\"But Robert Newman said we'd make a public and we did. It was a bold venture in 1895 [but] it worked.\"\n\nThis year's Proms season - the 123rd - has seen 80 orchestras and ensembles performing more than 400 pieces of music, including 30 premieres, over eight weeks.\n\nHighlights included Nicola Benedetti's dramatic performance of Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No 1; the Aurora orchestra playing Beethoven's Eroica from memory; and French orchestra Les Siecles breaking into Daft Punk's Get Lucky for their encore.\n\nSaturday's Last Night wrapped up the season in traditional good spirits, with Swedish soprano Nina Stemme dressing up as a Valkyrie to deliver Rule Britannia.\n\nThe concert opened with a premiere of Flounce, a spritely new work by Finnish composer Lotta Wennakoski, whose staccato strings and sweeping crescendos resembled one of Bernard Hermann's soundtracks for Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nStemme later brought the audience to tears with a sublime performance of the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.\n\nAcross the UK, fans joined in the fun with Proms in the Park concerts in Enniskillen, Swansea, Glasgow and London's Hyde Park.\n\nMica Paris braved the Welsh rain to deliver an impassioned tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, while the London audience were treated to Bryn Terfel lugging around milk churns as he performed If I Were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Dame Evelyn Glennie delivered an eye-wateringly brisk performance of Flight of the Bumblebee; while Hyde Park was headlined by Kinks legend Sir Ray Davies.\n\n\"I don't know anywhere else in the world where you have something like this,\"marvelled Nina Stemme ahead of her performance.\n\n\"I think we should do more concerts with this kind of participation, in various forms, from the audience.\"\n\nThe 2017 Proms welcomed nearly 300,000 concert-goers through the doors of the Royal Albert Hall, with one in five purchasing standing tickets which are sold on the day for \u00a36.  \n\nMore than 35,500 tickets were bought by people attending the Proms for the first time and 10,000 under-18s attended concerts across the season. \n\nThe BBC Proms will return on 13 July, 2018.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But in return Mr Kim wanted all sanctions on North Korea lifted, something the US was not prepared to offer. \n\nThere was also a question over the network of facilities that extend beyond Yongbyon. Last month, Stephen Biegun, the US state department special representative for North Korea, said North Korea had committed in pre-summit talks to destroy all of the nation's plutonium- and uranium-enrichment facilities, dependent on unspecified US measures in return. \n\nYongbyon is North Korea's only known source of plutonium but the country is believed to have at least two other facilities where uranium is enriched.\n\nThose unspecified US measures appear now to have been complete sanctions relief, which Mr Trump would not offer. The US president also suggested in his news conference that Mr Kim had offered only the destruction of Yongbyon and not North Korea's entire nuclear apparatus.\n\nThe president said that when he raised the issue of a second enrichment facility apart from Yongbyon, the North Korean delegation was\"surprised\"by what the US knew.\n\nNorth Korea's foreign minister later said that Pyongyang had been seeking partial sanctions relief, not a complete lifting.\n\nThe North had offered to permanently stop nuclear and long-range rocket testing, the minister added.\n\nIs this a setback for Trump?\n\nThe first summit between the two leaders, which took place in Singapore in June 2018, was criticised for having produced little in terms of substance, leading to anticipation that Mr Trump would push at the summit in Hanoi to produce an agreement on denuclearisation.\n\nThe failure will be viewed as a setback for self-styled deal-maker Mr Trump, who has talked up his historic rapprochement with Mr Kim as a significant policy achievement.\n\nSome saw the president's decision to not agree a deal as a good move.\n\n\"From Mr Trump's perspective it will be a loss he can weather,\"Andray Abrahamian, a North Korea expert at Stanford University, wrote in a column for the BBC.\"A'bad deal' in which he gave away a lot would inspire years of debate and pushback from US foreign-policy elites. With this, he's spun it as saveable through working-level talks.\"\n\nThe summit came as Mr Trump was facing increased scrutiny at home in the US over his business dealings and alleged ties to Russia, after his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen testified before Congress on Wednesday.\n\nInternational reaction\n\nA statement from South Korea's presidential office called the breakdown of talks\"regrettable\"but said the US and North Korean leaders had made\"more meaningful progress than at any time prior\".\n\nSouth Korean leader Moon Jae-in has worked to improve bilateral relations between the two Koreas, and played a role in arranging the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore.\n\nA later statement from President Moon said he had held a 25-minute phone conversation with Mr Trump and\"looked forward to productive results at follow-up consultations between the US and North Korean leaders\".\n\nChina, North Korea's main ally, said it hoped both sides would keep talking. \n\n\"Solving this problem is definitely not something that can be achieved overnight,\"foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said. \n\nWhat was said about Otto Warmbier?\n\nUS media extensively covered remarks by Mr Trump about an American student, Otto Warmbier, who died from extensive injuries shortly after he was released from North Korean detention in 2017.\n\nThe president said he had raised the Warmbier case with Mr Kim and believed the North Korean leader's assurances that he knew nothing of the student's treatment.\n\n\"Some really bad things happened to Otto - some really really bad things. But he tells me that he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word,\"Mr Trump said.\n\nWarmbier, who was 22, was arrested for taking a propaganda poster from a hotel while on a visit to Pyongyang in January 2016. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. \n\nMr Trump is not thought to have pressed Mr Kim during their talks on North Korea's wider human rights record. \n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the United Nations and international powers, the North Korean regime is among the world's worst human rights abusers, with an estimated 80,000 - 120,000 political prisoners and a history of murder, torture, and sexual violence perpetrated against its citizens.\n\nWhat does denuclearisation mean?\n\nThere is uncertainty about what exactly both sides mean by denuclearisation. Washington has previously said North Korea must unilaterally give up its all of its nuclear weapons and destroy all of its nuclear facilities before there can be any sanctions relief, but that condition is known to be a sticking point for the North Koreans. \n\nIt is thought Mr Kim views denuclearisation as a mutual arrangement in which the US withdraws its military presence on the Korean peninsula.\n\nAsked at the news conference on Thursday what he meant by denuclearisation, Mr Trump said:\"To me it's pretty obvious, we have to get rid of the nukes.\"\n\nMr Trump said the US delegation\"had some options and this time we decided not to do any of the options\". \n\nWhere does this leave the relationship?\n\nThe pair seemed to get along at the Hanoi summit, as they did at the previous summit in Singapore. They took a poolside stroll for the cameras, although neither appeared to say much.\n\nSpeaking after the talks in Hanoi, Mr Trump said Mr Kim was\"quite a guy and quite a character\"and described their relationship as\"very strong\".\n\nDespite the lack of an agreement, the second summit would appear to build on a significant shift in the tenor of the relationship between the two nations. \n\nIn late 2017, they were exchanging vitriolic threats, with Mr Trump calling Mr Kim\"little rocket man\"and Mr Kim calling Mr Trump a\"mentally deranged dotard\".\n\nAn end to war?\n\nBefore the summit, there was talk of a possible political declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War, which finished with an armistice rather than a full peace treaty.\n\nWith the abrupt end of the talks, that peripheral goal seemed to have been kicked into the long grass.\nTL;DR: A summit between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief, the US president has said.\n\nArticle: Josie Clacher died on Tuesday morning in the town of Alaro where she was staying with friends and family.\n\nShe was the daughter of Rachel Clacher, co-founder of Wrexham-based telephone answering firm Moneypenny.\n\nThe company said:\"We are all extremely devastated by this tragic news and our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this tragic time.\"\n\nThe firm provides a telephone reception service for UK businesses and employs more than 400 staff in Wales, New Zealand and the United States.\nTL;DR: An 18-year-old woman has been found dead in a swimming pool at her family's villa in Majorca.\n\nArticle: Short-haired Milagros\"Mili\"Hernandez has been praised on social media by Olympians Mia Hamm and Abby Wambach.\n\nMili's club team was booted from Sunday's final tournament in Omaha, Nebraska, even after her father showed identity documents proving her gender.\n\nTournament officials cite an error on team forms for the disqualification.\n\nTheir attention was drawn to the issue because someone on a rival team complained, based on her appearance.\n\nOfficials then checked the forms and contacted the Azzurri Soccer club, where Mili plays for the Achurros team, to say she was listed as a boy.\n\nBefore her team could take the field, they were summarily disqualified.\n\nHer father, Gerardo Hernandez, had brought her insurance card and other documentation to Sunday's game, but said that tournament officials were not interested in speaking to him.\n\n\"They told us the thing was decided,\"he told the Washington Post, adding that\"that wasn't the right way to treat people\". \n\n\"Just because I look like a boy doesn't mean I am a boy. They don't have a reason to kick the whole club out,\"Mili told local station WOWT-TV.\n\nTwo-time gold medallist and World Cup winner Hamm made an offer to Mili to play at the Team First Soccer Academy camp, which she hosts.\n\nWambach published an Instagram video with the message:\"Mili, don't EVER let anyone tell you that you aren't perfect just as you are.

It is clear to see that officers are increasingly expected to plug the gaps created as the service is stripped back to the bare bones.\"\n\nHe said policing was not a\"nine to five\"job and officers could not\"just down tools and clock off the moment their shift is due to end\".\n\n\"As such overtime is sometimes inevitable and often compulsory but it should not be used as a crutch to prop up the service enabling it to meet ordinary day to day demand\", Mr Apter said.\n\nHe said the money spent on overtime in 2017-18 could have paid for 10,000 new constables in England and Wales for a year and that many officers would prefer an additional colleague to the extra pay.\n\nThe Police Federation said the average officer's annual salary was \u00a334,000.\n\nActively recruiting\n\nDuring the 2017-18 financial year, the Met dealt with three terror attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire and a spike in violent crime - resulting in\"significant overtime expenditure\"of \u00a3107.3m - almost \u00a315m more than 2016-17.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Sir Craig Mackey said:\"It should be noted, however, that we are now actively recruiting and plan to be back to 30,750 officers by late next year. \n\n\"Police officers have had to work on rest days, sometimes at short notice and indeed on bank holidays in order to get the job done. \n\n\"Therefore, it is only right they are paid the correct overtime for their hard work.\"\n\nSir Craig added that the overall \u00a3490.8m payout in overtime was a fraction of the Met's \u00a316.2bn budget over the same five-year period.\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council's (NPCC) Chief Constable Francis Habgood said overtime could be an\"effective way\"of managing unexpected incidents including terror attacks or missing people, but that officers numbers were down to the same level as in 1985.\n\nHe added:\"We know our officers are under increased strain and that excessive overtime can be a source of stress and will affect personal lives.\"\n\nForty out of 49 UK police forces were able to provide five years' worth of data.\n\nAlthough Police Scotland spent the third highest amount on overtime (\u00a3106.8m), the force had the lowest average overtime spend per officer (\u00a31,033.13) out of all forces in the last full financial year.\n\nHowever, in 2017-18 one Police Scotland officer received a payment of \u00a3109,854.60. The force said this was a result of back dated'held in reserve' payments following a judicial review, rather than payment for hours clocked up that year.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Angela McLaren said Police Scotland monitored officers' additional hours in order to keep\"overtime to a minimum\".\n\n\"However, major events and incidents, both planned and unplanned, do occur - for example, planned events such as the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and unplanned incidents such as the UK threat level being raised to critical in 2017,\"she added.\n\n\"These events and incidents must be policed sufficiently to ensure we meet our first priority, which is public safety.\"\n\nIn a year that saw a suicide bomber kill 22 people in the Manchester Arena attack, Greater Manchester Police paid out the most, on average, to its officers.\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the additional hours were also needed to cover for vacancies and for\"policing special events\", which included football.\n\nHe said the force was facing\"the really difficult challenge of losing 2,000 officers in the last five years\".\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable David Hartley said his force - which had 295 fewer officers than it did in 2013 - had a\"heavy reliance\"upon overtime to cover events such as protests and\"high risk local derbies\".\n\n\"The reduction of front line resource has a clear and obvious impact on the reliance on overtime to continue to offer the outstanding level of service to which we aspire.\n\nBedfordshire Police's Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said his force was facing a\"significant funding shortfall\".\n\nHe said:\"Most recently, a request was made for \u00a310m of increased funding by Bedfordshire Police, but we received a settlement of \u00a33m.  \n\n\"Until Bedfordshire Police is adequately funded, there will continue to be times where the use of overtime is essential in order to meet the demand.\"\n\nThe Home Office said it was investing \u00a3460m into the policing service and had a Police Special Grant scheme, through which forces could apply for extra funding when resources were likely to be stretched.\n\nA spokesman added that any decisions around recruitment and resourcing were for chief constables and police crime commissioners.\nTL;DR: Police officers worked on average more than 97 hours overtime each in one year, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nArticle: Since I came back to the BBC I hope I've made two things clear.\n\nFirst that the BBC is living with a licence fee that for five years will have been flat - it will not have gone up at all. And, at the same time, we are absorbing extra costs that we were asked to take on - for the World Service, S4C and the roll-out of broadband. \n\nThat's why the organisation has had to look for savings - so that we, like everyone else in these difficult economic times, can live within our means. My concern - along with that of everybody I meet inside and outside the BBC - is to ensure that the quality of what we do is not compromised along the way. \n\nWe are here to produce exceptional and distinctive programmes and services for Britain and the world. But I do believe, as I said only last week, that the BBC has taken incremental change as far as it can. Something has to give. And that means hard choices. But there is one choice I will never make - and that's to sacrifice quality. And I believe that's what the British public thinks too.\n\nThe second point I've made is that the BBC is, by its nature and history, an organisation that constantly reinvents itself, an organisation that takes the idea of public service broadcasting - to inform, educate and entertain - and makes it relevant for each generation in our nearly one hundred year history. \n\nI remember myself the launch of BBC News Online when I was running BBC News. There was a great deal of scepticism, to put it mildly. But we were doing what the BBC and its staff have always done - using our innate creativity to lead the way. That's why now - for this generation - I believe the iPlayer is a key part of the future for public service broadcasting. It's the gateway for people who increasingly want to watch and listen to what they want, when they want it - on tablets, on mobiles as well as other screens. I am sure that this is going to be increasingly important for our younger audiences. And reaching those audiences is vital for the BBC.\n\nReconciling these two aims - financial and strategic - has led us to this difficult conclusion. We should close BBC Three as a broadcast or linear channel and ask Danny and his team to reinvent it as a channel online and on the iPlayer. We propose making this change in the autumn of next year. \n\nI believe it's the right thing to do: Young audiences - the BBC Three audience - are the most mobile and ready to move to an online world. 25% of viewing by 16-24 year olds is to catch-up or other screens and over the next few years we expect that to reach 40%. We recognise that, for now, most of this audience still do their viewing on television, and that is why we plan to show BBC Three's long-form content on either BBC One or BBC Two.\n\nI'm convinced that the BBC as a creative organisation will be able to reinvent a space for young people on the iPlayer that will be bold, innovative and distinctive. It will not just be a TV channel distributed online - it will be an opportunity to look at new forms, formats, different durations, and more individualised and interactive content. It will play to BBC Three's strengths, offer something distinctive and new, and enhance the BBC's reputation with young audiences. And I will challenge everyone in the BBC to spend much more time focusing on programming for young audiences. We will lead the way.\n\nLet me just say to Zai [Bennett, BBC Three's controller] and the BBC Three team: You produce, and will continue to produce, amazing programmes - bringing new ideas, new stories and new talent to our screens. BBC Three has an extraordinary track record - it's been home to Gavin and Stacey, Little Britain, Bad Education and, right now, Bluestone 42. \n\nI've also been seriously impressed by the current affairs I've seen - from Blood, Sweat and T-Shirts and Our War, to Reggie Yates's outstanding reports from South Africa, ending just this week. You can be rightly proud of what you have achieved so far. I want you to carry on making programmes for young audiences that continue to break new ground.\n\nThis is the first time in the BBC's history that we are proposing to close a television channel. I can't rule out it being the last change to our programmes or services. It will save the BBC over \u00a350 million a year. \u00a330 million of that will go into drama on BBC One. And it also means we will extend Children's programmes by an hour a night and provide a BBC One +1 channel. I must stress - all of this is what we are proposing to the BBC Trust. They will have the final say.\n\nI am certain that this decision is strategically right - but it's also financially necessary too. Delivering the savings programme following the last licence fee negotiation means these changes are happening earlier than they might in a better financial environment. And I don't simply want to keep salami slicing the budgets in a way that means our frontline staff are always asked to keep doing more with less. \n\nI am sure that we will have to face up to further difficult challenges as we build the BBC for the future. But in making those changes, I am determined to ensure we embrace the new opportunities technology gives us - and match that with programming of the highest quality that is simply the best in the world.\nTL;DR: BBC Director General Tony Hall has confirmed he plans to close BBC Three from autumn 2015 and move its content online. \n\nIn an  email to BBC staff , he explained the reasons behind the move.\n\nArticle: By Thomas MackintoshBBC News, London\n\nUnder the new \u00a31.4bn project, up to 967 new homes will be built - as it stands only 20% will be affordable.\n\nIt falls short of Sadiq Khan's pledge for 35% for developments on public land, though he accepts it is a\"starting point.\"\n\nA charity has urged him to\"claw back\"as much affordable housing as possible.\n\nMr Khan expects the amount of affordable housing in the Croydon project\"to rise over time\", something which Brian Robson, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, backs.\n\nMr Robson said:\"I'm sure there are reasons as to why the deal was struck this way, but the mayor has been really strong in getting developers to stick to these affordable housing targets since coming into office.\"\n\nSince his 2016 election win, the Mayor of London, has used\"planning powers\"to intervene in four separate developments across London and raise the amount of affordable homes in each of those schemes to his required 35%.\n\nMr Khan and his team can assert influence on large proposals to make sure plans meet three\"policy tests\".\n\nThese include a project having a significant impact on more than one London borough, the London Plan and for\"sound planning reasons for intervention\".\n\nIn October, Mr Khan scrutinised plans to build 348 homes on the site of a Wandsworth Homebase store on Swandon Way as it emerged that only 23% of those homes would be cheaper.\n\nHe said he used his\"full range of planning powers\"to bring the level of lower-priced housing to his required minimum of 35%.\n\nSince becoming mayor, Mr Khan has intervened with three other developments - in Wealdstone, Tottenham Hale and Mill Hill - in order to raise the amount of affordable housing in. \n\nAlthough the Westfield project was referred to the mayor, rather than\"called in\", Mr Robson has urged Mr Khan to take a similar approach with the Croydon development - which will see the existing Whitgift Centre, on private land, be demolished.\n\nHe said:\"We are in a housing crisis at the moment. \n\n\"It is vitally important he continues to squeeze as much affordable housing out of the developer.\"\n\nSpeaking about public land, James Murray, deputy mayor for housing, said:\"People in London rightly expect there to be a high level of affordable housing given the land is in public ownership.\n\n\"Yet it is sold off to the highest bidder for a one-off land receipt and the homes built are affordable to very few people.\"\n\nCity Hall said, in terms of the Westfield project, the mayor\"accepted a starting point of 20% affordable housing to get this major regeneration scheme for Croydon under way as soon as possible\".\nTL;DR: Croydon could miss out on 145 new affordable homes as part of recently approved plans to build a huge shopping centre in south London.\n\nArticle: 9th century -  Founding of\u00a0Kievan Rus, the first major Eastern Slavonic state.

But, in keeping with French rules, there were no scallops until the end of the breeding season at the start of October.\n\nLike many fishermen here, he is adamant that British boats should abide by those same French rules when it comes to fishing for scallops - even though the UK government has in the past imposed no similar restrictions on its vessels.\n\nTheir refusal to do so justified the attack last week, he argues. \n\n\"Whatever happens,\"he told me,\"I don't think the British will come back, because if they do another confrontation is inevitable. We'll defend our livelihood. I can't just stand by and watch.\"\n\nWhy the scallops skirmish began\n\nFor the past few years, a carefully constructed truce has kept the peace over this watery battlefield. The British agreed to ban their larger fishing vessels from the area until October, in return for extra fishing rights, and on the understanding that smaller British boats could fish there all year round.\n\nBut the number of smaller boats coming across the Channel has been growing and this year the French asked that all British boats stay away from the scallop fishing grounds until the catch could be shared.\n\nSmaller British fishermen are already feeling hard done by because the vast majority of their EU fishing quotas go to larger British industrial fishing fleets, and many struggle to make a profit. \n\nBut scallops are not restricted by standard EU quotas. \n\nLarger vessels have limits on the number of days they can fish for them but smaller boats do not - an important symbolic advantage.\n\nUnder the deal sketched out in London on Wednesday, the limits on bigger boats will remain. But the smaller British boats under 15m (50ft) will be subjected to the same rules and be given compensation for losses. \n\nThe terms still have to be finalised in Paris on Friday. But the two governments said that under a voluntary agreement all UK vessels would\"respect the French closure period in the Baie de Seine\".\n\nMr Quesnel said the conflict was the fault of the leaders, not the fishermen from either side. \n\nThe idea behind the French rule, he said, was\"to let the scallops reproduce, not to fish it all out in three weeks and leave nothing behind. I believe the British boats all came this year to catch as much scallop as possible, because they know they won't have access to these after waters after [Brexit]\".\n\nA few kilometres away, in a tiny shed at Dives-sur-Mer, fish and mussels are being emptied straight from the boats on to a handful of well-scrubbed counters.\n\nOne of the fishermen here, Frank Tousch, remembers the clashes last week as\"frightening\". His tiny boat, Le Sachal'eo, was crushed between La Rose Des Vents and a 30m Scottish vessel, after he joined the demonstration at sea. \n\nHe shows us the cracks still running along the top of the wooden hull which he says will take him two weeks to repair.\n\n\"It pushed me from behind, up against La Rose Des Vents. Then pulled alongside to crush me,\"he said.\"I was very scared; it was such a big boat. We were lucky that our hull was plastic so it bounced back into shape. Had it been all made of wood, it would have been crushed.\"\n\nFrank agrees that the only way to solve the stand-off is for all British boats to observe the same restrictions as French fishermen.\n\nThe owner of La Rose Des Vents, Fabrice Huout, joins us at the market.

They cause the hair follicles to shrink, eventually becoming so small that they are invisible, leading to the appearance of baldness.\n\nReverse balding?\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have analysed which genes are switched on when men start to go bald.\n\nThey found levels of a key protein called prostaglandin D synthase are elevated in the cells of hair follicles located in bald patches on the scalp, but not in hairy areas.\n\nMice bred to have high levels of the protein went completely bald, while transplanted human hairs stopped growing when given the protein.\n\nProf George Cotsarelis, of the department of dermatology, who led the research, said:\"Essentially we showed that prostaglandin protein was elevated in the bald scalp of men and that it inhibited hair growth. So we identified a target for treating male-pattern baldness.\n\n\"The next step would be to screen for compounds that affect this receptor and to also find out whether blocking that receptor would reverse balding or just prevent balding - a question that would take a while to figure out.\"\n\nThe inhibition of hair growth is triggered when the protein binds to a receptor on the cells of hair follicles, said Prof Cotsarelis.\n\nSeveral known drugs that target this pathway have already been identified, he added, including some that are in clinical trials.\n\nThe researchers say there is potential for developing a treatment that can be applied to the scalp to prevent baldness and possibly help hair regrow.\nTL;DR: A biological clue to male baldness has been discovered, raising the prospect of a treatment to stop or even reverse thinning hair.\n\nArticle: Mission Mars, which runs Deaf Institute and Gorilla, announced the\"difficult decision\"to close them on Thursday.\n\nSacha Lord said it had been a\"dark day\"for the city but he had\"received interest from potential buyers\".\n\nMusicians shared their distress at the news, including The Charlatans' singer Tim Burgess, who said it was\"awful\".\n\nIn an announcement on Thursday, Mission Mars chief executive Roy Ellis said the decision had been made\"against the backdrop of Covid-19 and the enforced closure of all of our sites and with continued restrictions upon opening of live music venues\".\n\nMr Lord, who works with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham to support the area's entertainment sector, said at the time the announcement was\"not the end of it\".\n\nHe said he had been contacted by seven\"solid operators\"interested in the venues and he is\"confident they will reopen\"and had written to Mission Mars\"asking them to share with me the sale details\".\n\nMission Mars has been approached for comment.\n\nBurgess, who has played both venues, was one of a number of musicians to post on social media about the closures.\n\nHis tweet was echoed by singer-songwriters Frank Turner and Lucy Spraggan, and New Order bass player Tom Chapman.\n\nMusic fans also contacted the BBC to share their upset at the closures.\n\nDouglas Paul Rainwater said losing the Deaf Institute was\"heartbreaking and an utter blow to smaller, new and emerging bands and artists\", while Steve Scrivener said Gorilla's intimacy created\"spiritual experiences\"and was\"a vital platform for the music industry's eco-system\".\n\nKate Blaszczyk said in a tweet:\"Two brilliant venues, what a loss for the city\", while Paul Robinson said it was\"absolutely shocking news\".\n\nMelissa Buckler Smith said she felt like she'd\"lost two old friends\"and said:\"My heart breaks for the staff and for music fans.\"\n\nThe Deaf Institute and Gorilla\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

He broke in through a side door and threatened the pensioner with a knife. \n\nMcCann was said by his barrister to be\"thoroughly ashamed\"of what he'd done. According to a newspaper report of the court case, his\"goal\"was to live a crime-free life and provide for his family legitimately. He'd missed the birth of his partner's first child because he was in prison and would be locked up when she gave birth again.\n\nBut because the judge considered him to be dangerous, McCann was ordered to serve a sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP), which meant that after a minimum term of two-and-a-half years he'd be freed only when the Parole Board decided it was safe to do so.\n\nThese sentences, designed to protect the public from dangerous prisoners, were scrapped in 2012. They formed part of the recent row between political parties over the release of London Bridge attacker Usman Khan. \n\nIt's an indication of how entrenched McCann's offending behaviour was that the board rejected his applications for parole three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2014.\n\nHowever, while in prison, in an effort to convince the authorities he could be safely let out, McCann completed a wide range of rehabilitation programmes, among them courses on thinking skills, victim awareness and building healthy relationships. \n\nHe was moved to a unit at Wymott Prison, Lancashire, for inmates with complex offending needs, including those with a personality disorder. He was also sent to Warren Hill jail, in Suffolk, which specialises in helping prisoners show they are suitable for release through a programme of\"risk reduction\". \n\nBy the time of his fourth parole hearing probation and prison officials said McCann's behaviour had improved, and he was freed in March 2017 on condition that he stay initially at an approved premises, also known as a bail or probation hostel, abide by a curfew, undergo drug testing and inform the authorities of any new relationship he entered into.\n\nBut within months McCann was back in trouble. He was arrested and charged with burglary and, in August, remanded in custody.\n\nCrucially, however, the authorities had not followed the correct procedures. \n\nBecause McCann had been on licence from prison when he was arrested, he should have been recalled to jail - a process that would have ensured the Parole Board was informed by the Probation Service about his case. But that didn't happen.\n\nThe failure to do so was hugely significant - it meant the board had no control over decisions about his future release. \n\n\"There were shocking consequences, life-changing consequences,\"said Prof Nick Hardwick, who was chair of the Parole Board at the time.\n\n\"If the case had been referred back to the Parole Board, as it should have been, he wouldn't have been re-released and those awful events wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nIn January 2018, after being found guilty of burglary, McCann was sentenced.\n\nLuton Crown Court heard that he'd broken into a house, stolen car keys and, along with an accomplice, driven off in two BMWs.\n\nJudge Richard Foster said McCann had told the jury a\"pack of lies\"and described his record as\"appalling\". \n\nHe noted the offences had been committed while on licence, telling him:\"You're pulling the wool over the eyes of your supervising officers.\"\n\nJudge Foster acknowledged that McCann's case should have been referred to the Parole Board.\"You certainly should have been recalled,\"he said, suggesting it was not too late to do so.\n\n\"You will serve three years in custody... to run concurrently with your current sentence if you are recalled,\"he said, adding that his jail term should not be reduced because of\"time served\"in prison while on remand.\n\nBut in spite of being given such a heavy hint by the judge, the recall process was not applied, the Parole Board was not informed about the case and time served on remand was counted as part of his sentence.\n\nAs a result McCann was dealt with as any offender given a fixed-term, or determinate, sentence would be. He was released at the halfway point, after 18 months, in February 2019.\n\nTwo months later, he began his devastating spree of offending.\n\nHad McCann been referred to the Parole Board, it would not have considered his release until the summer. A panel would have assessed his case in great detail and the expectation is that he would not have been let out at that stage.\n\nQuestions about the failure to notify the board centre on the National Probation Service - and in particular, its office at Watford, Hertfordshire, where McCann's case was being handled.\n\nIan Lawrence, general secretary of the probation union NAPO, said there was a variety of problems there, including a number of senior staff changes.\n\n\"It was pretty much chaos in the office in terms of the supervisory system,\"he told BBC News.\"It was not a happy place.\"\n\nIn September 2019, an inspection report found that performance in the wider region was undermined by workloads that were\"too high\", with officers having to manage an average of 42 cases each. \n\nThe report said there were\"significant staff shortages\", with gaps filled by agency workers, and identified problems assessing the threat posed by offenders.\n\n\"Staff did not sufficiently analyse the risk of serious harm or consider victims and potential victims,\"it added.\n\nAs a result of the failings, four probation officers from the Watford office faced disciplinary proceedings, one of whom was found guilty of gross misconduct and has since been demoted. \n\nTwo other workers were investigated for poor performance, including their handling of the McCann case. One employee was sacked and the contract of the other individual, who was from an agency, was terminated. \n\nBut Nick Hardwick believes individual members of staff should not be made scapegoats for more fundamental weaknesses within a system that has had to contend with budget cuts and a controversial re-structuring in 2014.\n\n\"What we don't know is whether the context of the pressures and resource shortages the probation service are under were contributory factors,\"he said. \n\n\"So, it's no good just looking at the person on the front line who made the decision - we need to look at the wider system failures here to see where the buck should stop.\"\n\nDr Jo Farrar, chief executive of HM Prisons and Probation Service, offered sympathy to McCann's victims for his\"appalling crimes\".\n\n\"We recognise that there were failings and we apologise unreservedly for our part in this,\"she said. \n\n\"We are committed to doing everything we possibly can to learn from this terrible case.\"\n\nIn addition to action against those who managed McCann's case, she said the organisation was taking\"significant steps to improve intelligence-sharing between agencies\".\n\nNew mandatory training on recall is being developed for all probation officers, and guidance on when prisoners should be recalled has been updated, added Dr Farrar.\nTL;DR: The crimes of serial rapist Joseph McCann shocked the country and sparked a nationwide manhunt. But he was a violent offender out on licence from prison. How did justice system failures leave him free to start his spree?\n\nArticle: By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News\n\nThere is a premier league of leading subsidised theatre companies that can take their hit shows to the West End, to Broadway and into cinemas, attract private funding and lure top talent.\n\nAnd the gap between that top tier and other publicly-funded theatres is growing.\n\nThat is one conclusion that can be drawn from BBC research comparing production levels in 2009 and 2014.\n\nThis research analysed 20 theatres that each get more than \u00a31m per year in government grants, plus a further 42 venues and touring production companies that get between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a31m per year.\n\nI compared production levels in 2009 and 2014 because 2009 was before the latest cuts began, and five years is a nice number.\n\nI was expecting to find a story about theatres cutting production numbers and cutting new writing.\n\nWhat has emerged is a different story - one of most theatres finding ways to deal with the cuts while maintaining, or increasing, production levels and new writing.\n\nThey have become more efficient, more resourceful and more entrepreneurial, without simply playing it safe.\n\nAt the 20 best-funded theatres, which each get more than \u00a31m per year, there were 23% more full professional productions in 2014 compared with five years earlier.\n\nThat is despite a total government funding cut of 2.1% to those theatres between 2009/10 and 2014/15 (not seismic - but around 19% once inflation is taken into account).\n\nThe 42 smaller companies have had their government grants cut by 0.25% over those five years - or 17% in real terms.\n\nAt these 42 lesser-funded venues and touring companies, the numbers of shows have not gone up, but nor have they dropped significantly.\n\nAnd despite the received wisdom that new plays get cut when times are tough because they are more difficult to sell, there has in fact been a rise in new writing.\n\nWho is in the premier league?\n\nThe National Theatre gets the biggest government grant, at \u00a317.6m. But that is down by \u00a31.6m, or 9%, since 2009.\n\nHowever, box office takings from the National's hit shows have shot up in that time.\n\nWar Horse, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and One Man Two Guvnors have all been to the West End and Broadway as well as on tour.\n\nSome 492,000 people bought tickets for National shows in the West End and on tour in 2009/10. That quadrupled to two million in 2013/14.\n\nSo when the National needed \u00a31.7m to build The Shed, a temporary theatre specialising in new writing while one of its auditoria was being refurbished in 2013 and'14, the money came from War Horse's Broadway profits.\n\nTherefore, War Horse paid for a new play about gender politics inspired by the controversial single Blurred Lines, a drama set in a homeless hostel and a thriller about a family holiday gone wrong.\n\nIt is an example of how a major subsidised theatre has become more commercial - and used its new income to pay for riskier new work that may go on to be the next hit.\n\n'Staggering' fundraising\n\nThe National Theatre is top of this theatrical league.\n\nAlso up there is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which balanced its Bardic staples with West End and Broadway runs of its adaptation of Roald Dahl's Matilda and a festival of new plays by women last year.\n\nThe National Theatre of Scotland had a West End transfer of Let The Right One In, as well as staging new musicals about eccentric poet Ivor Cutler and teenage girls who fought a friend's deportation.\n\nAt the Young Vic in London, new works tackled topics from Syria to synesthesia, while the venue took its crowd-pleasing productions of The Scottsboro Boys and A Doll's House to the West End.\n\nThe Young Vic's latest annual accounts also revealed a\"staggering\"\u00a31.3m in fundraising from trusts, individuals and corporate sponsors in 2013/14. There has also been an\"increase in major donations\"at London's Royal Court.\n\nThe 20 best-funded theatres also include the Birmingham Rep, which gained an extra auditorium when it moved into a refurbished building in 2013. Chichester Festival Theatre remains the regional theatre with the best track record for London transfers.\n\nAt the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, annual audience figures were up 16% in 2013/14 and there has been a\"step change\"in fundraising, while the Theatre Royal Plymouth is increasing its production levels, including a\"major increase\"in new writing.\n\nThese venues will point out that any progress is down to much hard work and ingenuity, and that they are still buffeted by the prevailing economic winds.\n\nThe Bristol Old Vic, another member of the \u00a31m+ club, said it\"fell considerably short\"of box office targets in 2013/14, the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse says the economic climate poses a\"significant threat\", while the Birmingham Rep says this year is a\"tipping point\"where none of its shows can afford to lose money.\n\nBeyond the top 20, the lesser-funded theatres and touring companies have been required to work hard and come up with equally ingenious ideas to maintain production levels and standards.\n\nIt is just that they, on the whole, have fewer options - especially outside London.\n\n'A miracle'\n\nDo these production numbers tell the whole story?\n\n\"Absolutely it's a sign of good health and resourcefulness,\"says Rachel Tackley, president of trade body UK Theatre and director of English Touring Theatre.\n\n\"It seems like a bit of a miracle really that we've managed to produce more with less, and more new work as well.\"\n\nBut others see it differently. Actors' union Equity says actors are working for fewer weeks in total at the best-subsidised theatres.\n\nIt has figures for\"actor weeks\"at 16 of the 20 leading theatres examined for the BBC research. They show that actors worked for 15% fewer weeks in 2013/14 compared with 2009/10.\n\nSmaller casts\n\n\"What I think that shows is that while the number of productions has gone up, the level of production hasn't,\"says Alistair Smith, editor of The Stage newspaper.\n\n\"What that would seem to indicate is that it's a change in the business model, moving away from the more traditional producing theatre model of having shows sit down for quite a long time and run for a month or so, to a model where you have more shows doing shorter runs, possibly with smaller casts as well.\"\n\nThe future outlook for the economic climate is still stormy, and the strong fear in the world of theatre is that we ain't seen nothing yet.\n\nCentral government will need to make more big cuts, while local authorities, which also fund many arts organisations, will also come under more financial pressure.\n\nMany of the best-funded theatres have put themselves in a relatively strong position. Other companies may struggle more.\n\nBut if there is one rule in theatreland, it is that the show must go on.\nTL;DR: A few years ago, the theatre establishment mobilised stars from  Danny Boyle  to  Dame Helen Mirren  to warn about funding cuts.  New figures  suggest theatres have actually increased production levels in recent years. So what is the story behind the stats?\n\nArticle: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we do experiments which sometimes throw up genuinely new science.

The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis.

And if so, when?\n\nShould schools close or enact remote learning? What about mass public gatherings, sporting and music events, transport and travel plans? \n\nThere are no certainties yet, but government officials say they will be guided by expert advice and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nStormont has set up its own contingency planning group in the event that the assembly could be temporarily closed, or that some MLAs are unable to get to Parliament Buildings for work, with video-conferencing just one option being discussed.\n\nMoney, money, money\n\nWednesday sees Chancellor Rishi Sunak's debut at the despatch box, delivering the first of two Budgets this year.\n\nExtra funding to tackle coronavirus is bound to dominate, with finance ministers from the devolved nations keen to see how that will affect their pots of money.\n\nThe Barnett formula is a system of grants that dictates the level of public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder it, extra funding - or cuts - from Westminster are allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them.\n\nFinance Minister Conor Murphy holds Stormont's purse strings and has delayed bringing his budget to the assembly until he sees how much extra cash Northern Ireland will receive.\n\nHe has been urged by some MLAs to provide help to small businesses and employees that may be negatively impacted as a result of coronavirus.\n\nMr Murphy will then have to take some difficult decisions and allocate funding for the next financial year across Stormont's nine departments;

It does not show up on blood tests or scans and is often difficult to diagnose. \n\nKevin Davies, a professor of medicine at the University of Sussex and an expert in fibromyalgia, said:\"People who present with problems will go for scans and blood tests, but nothing shows up as it is all about pain. \n\n\"But that doesn't mean there isn't a problem - it's just the doctor can't make a diagnosis of which he feels secure about.\"  \n\nIt is thought about one million people are living with the condition across the UK. \n\nFibromyalgia is recognised as a condition by NHS Choices in England and Scotland, meaning treatments should be available to patients. \n\nHowever, in practice the availability of services is patchy as not all health trusts have the resources to target the condition specifically. \n\nWhile there is no specific figure for Northern Ireland, it is thought around one in 25 may be coping with symptoms - a majority of them undiagnosed. \n\nLouise Skelly, director of operations at the Patient and Client Council, said:\"What we are surprised about is how many patients have come forward, wanting to share their stories. \n\n\"They felt very isolated and very alone and what we also discovered is that the clinicians also have found this a difficult area to work in so they have welcomed the sharing of knowledge and information.\"\n\nConcerns taken seriously\n\nIts recognition as a condition will raise awareness of it among the public, but also among health professionals. \n\nOnce diagnosed, patients will receive a\"pathway\"that will outline what services are available including medication or advice around exercise and alternative therapies. \n\nAccording to patients, the biggest breakthrough is having their concerns taken seriously. \n\nMartina Marks was not diagnosed for 10 years. \n\n\"It was a very long journey. I hadn't heard of it and neither had my GP,\"she said. \n\n\"It was important that I got a diagnosis, because I'd been going through different treatments, seeing different doctors and nothing was giving me relief.  \n\n\"Some of them don't understand the illness and I think we need an awareness campaign for the medical profession to understand the variety of symptoms with fibromyalgia and the severity of it.\"\n\nWhile there is no cure for the condition, there is evidence that lifestyle changes including relaxation, heat, exercise and diet can make a difference. \n\nSevere cases will be treated with medication.\nTL;DR: Fibromyalgia is to be recognised by health professionals in Northern Ireland as a long-term condition.\n\nArticle: William Cater, 47, from Cirencester, drove into a line of queuing traffic waiting to leave the motorway at junction 25, in September 2018. \n\nHe admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and a further two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving at Taunton Crown Court.\n\nCater will be sentenced on 26 March. \n\nThe crash happened on the southbound carriageway a mile north of Taunton, at about 08:30 BST, on 13 September 2018.\n\nThe two people who were killed were Rod Walsh, 54, from Cheddar, and Joanne Jennings, 45, from Highbridge.\n\nAn inquest into their deaths heard Mr Walsh died from chest injuries and Mrs Jennings from head injuries.\n\nFive other people were injured, two of them seriously.\n\nPolice said the crash between the lorry and a car\"impacted on six other vehicles in front of the car which were also queuing\".\n\nHundreds of vehicles were caught up in the tailbacks on the M5.\n\nThe southbound carriageway was reopened 11 hours after the crash happened.\nTL;DR: A lorry driver has admitted causing the deaths of two people who were killed in a crash on the M5.\n\nArticle: The Scottish SPCA said the lizards were found in poor condition on land near Yorkhill Hospital on Tuesday.\n\nThe dragons are now being cared for at its Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre at Cardonald, where staff have named them Ant and Dec.\n\nThe charity said whoever dumped the lizards was\"irresponsible and cruel\"\n\nScottish SPCA ambulance driver Jean MacKay said:\"I arrived at the park to find two bearded dragons in a secluded corner.

Some trade restrictions have been eased and the White House has been lobbying the US Congress to terminate an economic embargo that has been in place for decades.\n\nWhat does a Trump presidency mean for US-Cuba relations?\n\nMr Trump's team has accused the Obama administration of giving too much away to Cuba without receiving enough in return.\n\nHis communications director, Jason Miller, said Mr Trump was seeking\"freedom in Cuba for the Cubans and a good deal for Americans where we aren't played for fools\". \n\nBut the White House said that better ties with Cuba served US interests and that reversing the changes would deal\"a significant economic blow\"to the people of Cuba. \n\n\"After five decades of not seeing results, the president believed it was time to try something different,\"said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \n\nNew flight\n\nIn a separate development the first scheduled commercial flight from the US to Havana in more than 50 years has departed from Miami.\n\nThe American Airlines (AA) flight on Monday morning was the first of a new service to the Cuban capital which will fly from Florida four times a day.\n\n\"It's a monumental day of great historic relevance with Miami being the epicentre of the Cuban-American community and American's hub for the region,\"AA Vice President Ralph Lopez was quoted by The Miami Herald  as saying. \n\nSeveral airlines began routes to other parts of Cuba earlier this year, with many more flights and destinations in the offing.\nTL;DR: Donald Trump says he will end the thaw between the US and Cuba if the country does not offer a \"better deal\".\n\nArticle: Worcestershire Archive and Archaeology Service said the remains, believed to include a tusk, were found and excavated in Staffordshire.\n\nIt is one of a number of finds of its kind from across the West Midlands, with another made at the same site a month ago. \n\nThe discovery will be analysed before going on display this weekend. \n\nRob Hedge, from the service, said the items, discovered on Wednesday, were believed to include parts of a woolly mammoth, including the tusk, and possibly other species.\n\nIt comes a month after a find at the same quarry in May.\n\nMr Hedge said:\"There have been lots of discoveries from the Ice Age all over the West Midlands.\n\n\"There have actually been a lot of really interesting finds made here and it is not very well known about.\"\n\nThe service would not disclose exactly where the remains were found.\n\nHowever, the information will be released when the items are on view to the public as part of the Lost Landscapes of Worcestershire exhibition, which starts on Saturday.\n\nMr Hedge said finds were often made on quarries, where there may be an archaeologist on site who can examine and record items before they are taken back to the office for further analysis.\n\nMostly the archaeological discoveries do not date back as far as the Ice Age, but occasionally discoveries of this nature are made in deeper parts, he added. \n\nHe believed they are likely to date from the Devensian period, the final bit of the last Ice Age between about 100,000 and 12,000 years ago.\nTL;DR: Fragments believed to have come from a woolly mammoth have been uncovered at a quarry.\n\nArticle: The gallery will officially close its doors this weekend to allow work to start on a \u00a330m refurbishment. \n\nA third of the money has been granted by the Heritage Lottery Fund, with the city council also committing \u00a310m.\n\nMarie Boulton said the project would be held in\"great esteem\".\n\nShe said there was an issue of people\"putting their head above the parapet\"at the moment.\n\n'Money coming'\n\nAberdeen is currently in the grip of a planning controversy over the Marischal Square project.\n\nDevelopers Muse are behind the \u00a3107m hotel, office and retail project.\n\nOpponents argue it would block the view of historic Marischal College and Provost Skene House.\n\nMs Boulton told BBC Scotland:\"There's going to be money coming from people but people want to remain anonymous.\"\n\nThe redesign of the Schoolhill art gallery building was backed by 27 votes to 15 by Aberdeen City Council in 2013.\nTL;DR: A councillor is confident money will be raised for the refurbishment of Aberdeen Art Gallery -

the target - had been plotting\"barbaric\"attacks on UK soil, he said.\n\nThe\"act of self defence\"was lawful, despite MPs previously ruling out UK military action in Syria, the PM said.\n\nKhan was killed in a precision strike on 21 August by a remotely piloted aircraft,\"after meticulous planning\", while he was travelling in a vehicle.\n\nAnother British national, Junaid Hussain, 21 and from Birmingham, was killed in a separate air strike by US forces in Raqqa on 24 August.\n\nBoth Khan and Hussain had been involved in actively recruiting IS\"sympathisers\"and plotting to attack\"high-profile public commemorations\"taking place in the UK this summer, the prime minister said. \n\nThe attorney general had been consulted and agreed there was a\"clear legal basis\"for the strike on Khan, Mr Cameron added. \n\nActing Labour leader Harriet Harman urged the government to publish the legal advice.\n\nDowning Street said it was a\"long-standing convention that we do not publish advice of the law officers\". \n\n'Directing murder'\n\nTwo years ago MPs rejected possible UK military action in Syria, but last September approved British participation in air strikes against IS targets in Iraq only.\n\nHowever, officials said the UK would\"act immediately [in Syria] and explain to Parliament afterwards\"if there was\"a critical British national interest at stake\".\n\nThe strike on Khan was\"the first time in modern times that a British asset has been used to conduct a strike in a country where we're not involved in a war\", the PM confirmed.\n\n\"Of course Britain has used remotely piloted aircraft in Iraq and Afghanistan but this is a new departure and that's why I thought it important to come to the House and explain why I think it is necessary and justified.\"\n\nMr Cameron told MPs:\"My first duty as prime minister is to keep the British people safe.\"\n\nIn reference to Khan, he added:\"There was a terrorist directing murder on our streets and no other means to stop him.\n\n\"This government does not for one moment take these decisions lightly.\n\n\"But I am not prepared to stand here in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on our streets and have to explain to the House why I did not take the chance to prevent it when I could have done.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\n\nUnmanned Reaper drones joined RAF Tornado jets in conducting surveillance and air strikes soon after Parliament authorised military action against the group calling itself Islamic State last September. \n\nThe vote confined that military action to Iraq, but at the time the prime minister told MPs he\"reserved the right\"to act elsewhere\"if there were a critical British national interest at stake\". \n\nThe government will argue the air strike on Reyaad Khan was such a case. But carrying out an RAF air strike in Syria will still be controversial; even more so because a British citizen was targeted. \n\nThough government officials insist that he posed a direct threat to the UK and was on a legitimate\"target list\", there'll be plenty of questions. What was the intelligence on which the decision was based? Whose target list was he on? \n\nThere are reports the CIA has compiled a list of high-value targets. There will inevitably be some suspicion around the secrecy - the MoD has never publicly stated how many Reapers the RAF is operating or where they're based. \n\nThe fact that RAF Reapers have been flying over Syria is not in itself a surprise. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told MPs last October they would be conducting surveillance missions. \n\nBut in a written statement he also stated:\"Reapers are not authorised to use weapons in Syria; that would require further permission.\"\n\nIn his address to the Commons, the prime minister also said:\n\nFollowing the statement, former attorney general Dominic Grieve said it was possible the decision taken by the government could be\"legally reviewed or challenged\".\n\nLabour's Ms Harman called for\"independent scrutiny\"of the attack, asking:\"Why didn't the attorney general authorise this specific action rather than merely'confirming there was a legal basis for it'?\"\n\n'Secret strikes'\n\nA family friend of Khan's from Cardiff, Mohamed Islam, called for an investigation\"to see the truth of this incident\".\n\nHe said it was\"very complicated, very sad and very hard\"for Khan's family.\n\nKat Craig, from human rights group Reprieve, called the air strike\"deeply worrying\".\n\n\"Make no mistake - what we are seeing is the failed US model of secret strikes being copied wholesale by the British government,\"she said.\n\nBBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the targeting of Khan by his own country had set a precedent.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said any future decisions on whether to target IS militants believed to pose a threat to the UK would be taken on a case-by-case basis, and declined to say whether any other such strikes have been authorised.\nTL;DR: Two British Islamic State jihadists who died in Syria were killed by an RAF drone strike, David Cameron has said.\n\nArticle: Ribble Valley MP and Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans, 53, has won praise from gay MPs from other parties for his decision to back the group ParliOut.\n\nSwansea-born, he stood twice in Welsh seats before landing the Lancashire constituency he has held since 1992.\n\nRhondda MP Chris Bryant, who is also gay, welcomed the decision.\n\nMr Bryant, who sits on the board of ParliOut, tweeted:\"Glad to see Nigel Evans is'coming out'.

But they appear evenly divided. \n\nWhy is GKN important?\n\nGKN is about as good an advertisement for British engineering as you can get. \n\nIts roots lie in the 18th century industrial revolution and there's not much it hasn't had a hand in making, from cannonballs for Wellington's army to Spitfires, Minis and the Ariane 5 rocket. \n\nIts Driveline business makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. VW, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler are all customers.\n\nAnd it is big in defence, a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake.\n\nHowever, it's not quite as British as it looks. Its head office is in Redditch in Worcestershire, but of GKN's 58,000 employees, only 6,000 work in Britain. The rest are spread around 30 countries.\n\nWhy does Melrose want to buy it?\n\nAt the end of last year GKN seemed to have got itself into a mess. \n\nIn October it warned profits would be lower than expected, and there was another warning in November. The company announced there was going to be\"detailed review\"of its US aerospace business and the division's head, Kevin Cummings, would resign. \n\nIn the end the results came in better than expected, but there was still an underlying problem - GKN simply wasn't as profitable as it ought to have been. Margins had fallen to 6.4% from 8.2%, and Melrose believed it could do better.\n\nSo in January Melrose launched its bid, initially at \u00a37bn, increased this month to \u00a38.1bn, with up to another billion offered to help out the pension fund.\n\nIt says it will keep the business together - for now. Its target, it says, is\"to re-energise and re-purpose GKN's operations\". It says it can beat GKN's own 10% target when it comes to profit margins. \n\nWhat is Melrose Industries?\n\nMelrose Industries is a British-based\"turnaround specialist\", listed on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation over \u00a34bn. \n\nIts strategy is to find\"good manufacturing businesses with strong fundamentals\"and then\"buy, sell, improve\"them within three to five years.\n\nIts string of turnaround successes has been hugely profitable. If you had invested \u00a31 in Melrose in 2005 it would be worth \u00a318 today.\n\nExecutive chairman of Melrose, Christopher Miller wrote to GKN shareholders explaining his strategy and insisting his firm was not an asset-stripper.\"Unlike private equity companies, we do not rely on debt to boost returns and use only modest and prudent levels of leverage, well within UK industrial norms.\"\n\nBut Melrose's record has been tarnished of late by problems at the manufacturer Brush, which it bought eight years ago and where it has invested some \u00a396m. Earlier this month it started negotiations with unions to lay off over a third of its British workforce in Leicestershire.\n\nHow has GKN responded?\n\nGKN has proposed far more drastic changes than anything Melrose is suggesting. It will, it says, split itself in two, sell non-core businesses, concentrate on its aerospace division and take steps to revive its margins.\n\nDriveline would merge with the American car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would get a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (\u00a31.28bn) in cash from Dana. \n\nThis new business would be listed on the New York and London stock exchanges. That, says GKN, would give it the wherewithal to hand shareholders \u00a3700m\"as soon as practicably possible\". \n\nOver the next three years it hopes to return in total \u00a32.5bn cash to investors.\n\nIn answer to Melrose's bid GKN said:\"Melrose is not the right owner for GKN. It lacks experience in relevant high technology businesses and of investing for the long-term. GKN is a much larger and more complex business than anything acquired by Melrose in the past.\"\n\nMelrose said GKN's reaction was\"panicked and fraught with contradictions\".\n\nWho else is worried by the bid?\n\nThe Unite union is not happy. In a letter to GKN shareholders it said:\"GKN is a major tier one supplier in the automotive and aerospace sectors. \n\n\"This means that the company needs to work closely both with manufacturers and with government and make significant investments in innovation for the future. \n\n\"These are cyclical industries, and Melrose's experience with Brush has not demonstrated that they have the ability to react to these cycles.\"\n\nSome of GKNs customers are also worried. Airbus said it would be\"practically impossible\"to give new business to GKN if the takeover went ahead because it damaged long-term investment prospects in GKN, which could reduce research and development (R&D) budgets and limit innovation. \n\nThe government has also stepped in. \n\nGreg Clark, the Business Secretary, wrote a letter to Melrose  asking for\"commitments, which would need to be binding in the event that your bid was successful\". These include maintaining the workforce, headquarters and R&D in the UK, and not selling defence businesses off in the short term.\n\nIn reply Melrose said it agreed with the Business Secretary's requests and added:\"Melrose has offered a legally binding commitment to the secretary of state to stand behind its intention to hold the GKN aerospace business as it delivers the improvement necessary to unlock its potential.\"\nTL;DR: By one o'clock this afternoon the fate of Britain's biggest engineering group, GKN will be decided.\n\nArticle: The poster by the far-right Vlaams Belang shows a woman wearing the iconic red-soled stilettos.  \n\nWords ranging from\"Sharia compatible\"at the ankle to\"stoning\"high up a thigh are marked at possible skirt lengths.\n\nThe legs belong to Anke Van dermeersch, a senator from the party.\n\nA judge at the Antwerp court has given the party 24 hours in which to take down the posters.    \n\nMiss Van dermeersch, a former Miss Belgium, called the decision a political ruling.  \n\nHer party has issued another advert, this time with the senator lying down and wearing similar-looking, but yellow-soled stilettos.\n\nThere has been no comment from the designer, who said the original advert tarnished his image.\nTL;DR: Luxury shoe designer Christian Louboutin has won a legal battle to stop his shoes being used in an anti-Islam campaign in Belgium.\n\nArticle: By Chris AndrewsBBC News NI\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that efforts to save the 242-year-old department store had failed.\n\nAmong its 12,000 employees, hundreds work across five Debenhams shops in Northern Ireland - Belfast, Londonderry, Ballymena, Craigavon and Newry.\n\nAs an anchor tenant, the business was viewed by shopping centres and town centres as a major draw, helping to bring in footfall which would benefit other stores nearby. \n\nThe chain's closure also follows news that Arcadia, home to Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, has entered administration.\n\nBBC News NI takes a look at what the loss means to the areas where Northern Ireland's five Debenhams branches are located.\n\n'A hammer blow' -

Foyleside Shopping Centre, Londonderry\n\nDebenhams opened at the Foyleside Shopping Centre in Londonderry in 2003 when an extension was built onto the main complex. \n\nFoyleside itself, now with more than 50 shops, officially opened in 1995, with existing anchor tenants Marks & Spencer and Dunnes Stores continuing to trade there.\n\nPaul Clancy, chief executive of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said Foyleside was\"in shock\"after the Debenhams closure.\n\nThere were more than 100 people\"struggling over what future they will have\"close to Christmas, he said.\n\nThe centre told BBC News NI it was confident a new tenant would be found to fill the space left behind by Debenhams.\n\nIt said it expected to make an announcement\"in the near future\", adding that, despite a challenging year, many other retailers continued to perform well.\n\n'Devastated' - Fairhill Shopping Centre, Ballymena\n\nDebenhams opened its first Desire fashion store in Ireland at Ballymena's Fairhill Shopping Centre in 2007.\n\nBallymena has grown as a popular shopping town, with Fairhill, opened in 1991, also home to major high street brands such as Marks & Spencer, Next and New Look.\n\nOne shopper said she visited Debenhams each time she was in Ballymena.\n\n\"It is a big loss for every town,\"she told BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme. \n\nBut two shoppers, both aged 19, described Debenhams' shopping offering as\"too old\", saying they were inclined to buy make-up brands online rather than in the shop.\n\nCllr Eugene Reid, President of the Ballymena Chamber of Commerce, said his thoughts were with the Debenhams employees affected.\n\n\"Stakeholders must now come together to ensure they are treated properly and town centres get the support they need to help them evolve,\"he added.\n\nEugene Diamond, who owns a convenience shop in the town, said Debenhams staff would be\"devastated by the news while on lockdown\".\n\nLargest shop in one of NI's largest centres - Rushmere Shopping Centre, Craigavon\n\nRushmere Shopping Centre, outside Craigavon, is one of Northern Ireland's largest retail complexes. \n\nThe centre itself, first opened in 1976, has 350,000 sq ft of mall space, more than a quarter of which is taken up by Debenhams.\n\nAt 82,000 sq ft it is by far the County Armagh mall's largest shop, although other major brands such as Sainsbury's, TK Maxx and Next also provide a draw for shoppers.\n\nBorder appeal - The Quays Shopping Centre, Newry\n\nDebenhams established its shop at the Quays Shopping Centre in Newry in 2004, five years after the centre opened.\n\nIt replaced one of the Quays' original tenants, Roches Stores, whose outlets across Ireland Debenhams would later take over.\n\nAs in Londonderry, Newry's proximity to the Irish border means it benefits from trade and shoppers coming from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nDebenhams Ireland did not reopen its shops in the Republic after the first Covid-19 lockdown, adding to Newry's potential appeal as one of the closest outlets for Irish shoppers.\nTL;DR: The news that Debenhams stores are set to close has been described as a \"hammer blow\" to town centres across Northern Ireland.\n\nArticle: By Rachel CurtisBBC News entertainment and arts reporter\n\nIt is a few days before opening night for the Cole Porter musical and the cast are pounding the stage floorboards with an energetic Shakespearean tap routine.\n\n\"Kevin believes in popular entertainment as well as demanding entertainment,\"says Sir Trevor.\n\n\"The Old Vic was the home of Shakespeare for decades in this country and it couldn't be a more perfect home for us,\"he adds. \n\nThe production, which first ran at the Chichester Festival Theatre this summer, retains the majority of its ensemble cast, including Hannah Waddingham and Alex Bourne.  \n\nThe 72-year-old director describes the show as a\"Shakespeare musical\"mixed with a\"considerable ingredient\"of on-stage and off-stage antics from Michael Frayn's Noises Off.\n\nA former artistic director of both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, Sir Trevor has directed 30 William Shakespeare plays and 20 musicals including the long-running Les Miserables and Cats.\n\n'Watch this Spacey'\n\nWith Kiss Me, Kate about to open, Sir Trevor has hopes he and Spacey might collaborate on a future musical project.  \n\n\"[Kevin Spacey] and I have talked about music theatre a great deal and there were a couple of occasions where we thought that we might be able to do one together,\"he says.\n\n\"I might be able to inveigle him into a musical show at The Old Vic and I haven't given up on that, so watch this space - or watch this Spacey.\"\n\nThe production allows the director to combine his love of musical theatre and the work of Shakespeare.\n\nHis career has balanced both - much like the production - but he says musical theatre has suffered from a history of\"pronounced critical snobbery\".\n\n\"It was regarded as a kind of boulevard entertainment that one couldn't take as seriously,\"he says.\n\nBut he adds his love of the genre means that he has never recognised a barrier between\"legitimate\"and\"illegitimate theatre\".\n\n\"Those different forms of expression are all made of the same cloth and I love doing both,\"he says.\n\nSir Trevor describes Kiss Me, Kate as a\"masterpiece\"and says the play within a play is one of the great musical works of the 20th Century.\n\nLeading lady Waddingham has high praise for the director's approach to the musical, which was last revived in London in 2001.\n\n\"In rehearsals when you're getting notes from people of that calibre - you feel like you should be paying them for the privilege,\"she says.\n\n'Government shame'\n\nThe production first ran at Chichester's Festival Theatre - one of the most successful regional theatres in the UK.\n\nThe venue has a solid history of staging West End transfers including Sweeney Todd, Singing in The Rain, South Downs and The Browning Version.\n\nArtistic director Jonathan Church says part of the theatre's success is a direct result of support from the Arts Council and the local authorities a decade ago.\n\nBut many regional theatres are now facing cuts from local authorities and the government's grant to the Arts Council has been reduced by 30%.\n\n\"The situation of the government deciding that they are going to take money away from the Arts Council has happened repeatedly over the years and it is very sad and I think very shaming,\"Sir Trevor says.\n\n\"So much work has gone on in the regions and it's under threat - I say shame on the government that it should be under threat at this moment,\"he adds.\n\nBut for now he is thankful for the opportunity to direct his regional co-production.  \n\n\"We are so thrilled to start the show out of town in Chichester and completely thrilled we have a finite run at The Old Vic,\"he says.\n\nKiss Me, Kate is at the Old Vic until 3 March.\nTL;DR: Sir Trevor Nunn's revival of Kiss Me, Kate is the first musical The Old Vic Theatre Company has staged since Kevin Spacey joined as artistic director.\n\nArticle: Around 300 officers and 14 coastguard ships are patrolling the coastline after packets of narcotics were found in several locations since Friday. \n\nPolice have urged members of the public to not open the parcels. \n\nRomania is said to be part of a drugs transit route connecting Latin America and Europe. \n\nThe packets are thought to be part of a shipment of an estimated tonne of cocaine that was found in an abandoned ship just over two weeks ago. \n\nTwo Serbian men were arrested in connection with the discovery. \n\nOn Sunday, police confirmed that two helicopters, several boats and divers were also taking part in the search. \n\nRomanian broadcaster Digi24 reported that the operation covered about 90km (55 miles) of coastline. \n\nPolice spokesman Georgian Dragan warned people not to open parcels they found on the beach. \n\nHe told local media:\"These drugs have a high concentration, more than 90%, and could pose a threat to life.\"\n\nIn 2016, Romanian police seized 2.5 tons of cocaine worth at least \u20ac600m (\u00a3516m).

turnout for the coins which were thought to be worth millions of pounds.\n\nMr Carter said most were still in a big block and that it could take many years to fully separate them.\n\nThe exhibition will last for three days before the coins go back to the archaeologists for further conservation work.\n\nMr Carter said:\"It has actually achieved huge international publicity and since it was found we have been cleaning back the clay and the earth.\n\n\"This is a chance to see the hoard as it was discovered, it is an amazing object and I'm sure a lot of people will come.\"\n\nThe hoard of mostly Celtic coins was unearthed from a field in Grouville in June and is currently being held at a secure location by Jersey Heritage. \n\nIt will be put on display in the foyer of the Jersey Museum at Weighbridge Place for three days as part of the Hidden Treasures festival.\n\nThe coins were discovered by two amateur metal detector enthusiasts, Reg Mead and Richard Miles who began their hunt after a woman told them her father had found coins in a field some years before.\n\nThere are thought to be about 52,000 coins contained within the block.\n\nMr Carter said:\"We don't know really what's in there, in cleaning it we have found more including some silver jewellery.\n\n\"At the moment it is one large lump, we are going to record it like that but later in the year we will start conservation work to see if there is more to be revealed by the hoard.\"\n\nHe said there was a lot of conservation work to be done as this was the Celtic world's largest ever coin hoard. \n\n\"We will try to do some of it online so people will see that, but it is a lab based activity that will take a couple of years.\n\n\"We are aiming for an exhibition in 2014 but there is still a lot of work to do, so in essence it will be the last chance to see it,\"he said.\nTL;DR: A hoard of Iron Age coins found in Jersey and worth up to \u00a310m will go on display at a museum from Thursday.\n\nArticle: The

Editor\n\nWriting on his blog, Mr Adams says David Cameron and Enda Kenny left the political process\"in a worse state than when they came\".\n\nHe also described the two prime ministers as\"the architects to the talks debacle\". \n\nThe talks resumed on Thursday morning.\n\nThe five main parties are at Stormont House to try and find agreement over finance, welfare reform and other unresolved issues.\n\nMr Adams said Martin McGuinness and Sinn F\u00e9in's negotiators are working hard to find solutions, but Secretary of State Theresa Villiers\"has stuck to the script which blames the north's parties for the crisis\". \n\nMr Adams said that without a\"different economic and fiscal model\"the political process would not work.\n\nThere is no sign of the parties bridging their differences over the budget and welfare reform. \n\nIt is unclear whether the discussions will end on Thursday or continue on Friday.\n\nHowever, the Commons is due to break for its Christmas recess at around 17:00 GMT. \n\nAt the weekend, Theresa Villiers told the BBC that the devolution of corporation tax could be difficult to pass before the May general election if a deal was not reached before the parliamentary recess. \n\nMs Villiers told the Sunday Politics\"what happens at the end of a parliament is, essentially, there is a wash-up stage where government and opposition discuss what can be speeded through so that it's done before dissolution takes place\". \n\nMs Villiers continued:\"It's not completely impossible that corporation tax could still be achieved in this parliament, with a later introduction after this week, but it becomes increasingly difficult.\"\n\nPreviously, the government has warned that if there was no deal before Christmas, there would be little chance of making progress in the new year. \n\nDiscussions between the parties lasted until nearly 22:00 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, there appeared to be little evidence of progress on the key financial issues. \n\nThe Ulster Unionists submitted a 24-point paper looking for some more welfare reform flexibilities. \n\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in apparently stuck rigidly to its own 11-point paper that essentially rejects all the proposed Westminster welfare changes. \n\nSome negotiators told the BBC that they privately believe the talks could be winding to a close.\n\nThey added that no deal could spell major problems for Stormont's future budgetary process and the stability of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive.\nTL;DR: The Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams has said last week's  intervention in the Stormont talks by the British and Irish prime ministers  was not \"a serious effort\".\n\nArticle: Police say 540,000 people rallied in Barcelona, the capital of the region in north-east Spain, while the rest gathered in four other Catalan towns. \n\nBut numbers were down sharply compared with last year's event, when 1.4 million rallied in Barcelona alone.\n\nSpain has consistently blocked attempts to hold a referendum on secession. \n\nCatalan regional president Carles Puigdemont had urged support for\"converting Catalonia into an independent state\".\n\nDivisions have also emerged between the separatist movement's main political grouping in the Catalan parliament, the Together for Yes coalition, and its radical leftwing ally, the CUP.\n\nMr Puigdemont, who took power in January, faces a confidence vote on 28 September.\n\nHe advocates a negotiated withdrawal from Spain. \n\nWhen Catalan nationalists held an unofficial referendum on independence in November 2014, 80% of those who voted backed independence. \n\nSunday is the\"Diada\", Catalonia's national day. It commemorates the moment in 1714 when Barcelona fell to troops loyal to Spain's King Philip V during the War of the Spanish Succession. \n\n\"We have to move towards the final outcome,\"58-year-old office clerk Xavier Borras, who planned to attend the rally in Barcelona with a friend, told AFP news agency.\n\n\"We can't wait any longer.\"\n\nSpain's leading parties, deadlocked in their efforts to form a new government after two inconclusive general elections since December, have shown little sympathy for Catalan grievances.\n\nThe region of 7.5 million people makes up 16% of Spain's population and accounts for almost 19% of national GDP.\nTL;DR: Some 800,000 people have turned out in Barcelona and other towns in Catalonia on a day of rallies by nationalists wishing to break with Spain.\n\nArticle: Voters backed a move from the existing cabinet model to a new committee system by 89,670 votes to 48,727.\n\nThe poll was triggered after a campaign by the It's Our City group, which said a change in governance would lead to\"better\"decision-making.\n\nCampaigner Anne Barr said:\"It's a fantastic result\".\n\nFollowing Monday's result council officers will begin work to draw up the precise form the new committee system will take, with changes set to be implemented next year.\n\nSpeaking after the result was declared, Ms Barr said:\"It's Sheffielders emphatically showing that they want change in the city, change for a better governance system.\n\n\"I would like to stress what a David and Goliath struggle it's been, because it's communities and residents going up against the establishment... which has at times been uncooperative in actually working with us in terms of changing things for the better.\n\n\"It's shown that people working together in the communities can effect powerful change.\"\n\nHow does the cabinet model work?\n\nUnder the existing model the council - consisting of 84 councillors - is run by a leader who appoints nine cabinet members.\n\nEach cabinet member has a specific area of responsibility, or portfolio, such as children's services or transport.\n\nThese 10 councillors form the executive and have responsibility for decision-making. \n\nA cross-party committee can call in decisions for scrutiny but the cabinet does not have to accept their recommendations.\n\nSome issues such as the budget, have to be decided and voted on by the whole council.\n\nHow does the committee system work?\n\nUnder a committee system, decision-making responsibilities are shared between more councillors.\n\nRather than a single cabinet member, a committee of several elected members makes decisions for a specific portfolio.\n\nCommittees are made up of councillors from all parties, with the number of seats proportionate to the political make-up of the council.\n\nCouncil CEO Kate Josephs said the committee system would be implemented in May 2022.\n\nShe told the Local Democracy Reporting Service:\"There's a lot of detail to work out and work through and that's what we'll be doing now. \n\n\"It will be really important that all the political parties involved in the council are working together to think through how the committee system will operate.\"\n\nThis has been a campaign from the grassroots that has changed things at the top of one of our biggest councils.\n\nThe outright anger there was about tree felling in Sheffield got a small group of people thinking\"are we getting our voices heard?\"\n\nA petition and over 20,000 signatures later they had forced a public vote on how Sheffield makes decisions.\n\nNow Sheffield Council will have to have committees with representation from all parties - rather than the ruling party making the decisions.\n\nBut, no party has a majority in Sheffield after the local elections so deciding how they run themselves is going to get messy.\n\n'Accountable, inclusive, transparent'\n\nDouglas Johnson, leader of the Green Party, said he was\"delighted\"with the result, saying it was\"good for democracy\".\n\nHe said:\"It's a big step towards much better democracy involving more people, and it allows the possibility for a change in thinking about how the council is run.\"\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Shaffaq Mohammed said the result was\"fantastic\", adding:\"They were craving for change and they voted for change.\"\n\nLabour Group leader Terry Fox congratulated campaigners on their achievement before saying he wanted to use the result\"as a positive opportunity to improve how the council works\".\n\nHe added:\"Ultimately, what everyone wants to see is a system that enables the council to deliver for Sheffield, that makes decisions in an accountable, inclusive and transparent way.\"\n\nThe result of the referendum is legally-binding and another vote on the issue cannot be held for nine years.\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We're here 500 years on, it's not going to fall down this May Morning.\"\n\nThe origins of May Morning are sketchy, but many believe it dates to the time the tower was built and the college chose to sing in spring. \n\nIt has remained uniform since the 17th Century, when the carol Hymnus Eucharisticus was written by the Benjamin Rogers at the college, thus ensuring its enduring appeal.\n\nAlthough a family-friendly event, students will often take full advantage of late closing times at pubs across the city and perform an all-night drinking endurance test. \n\nAt 05:00 cafes and pubs will reopen to offer the bleary-eyed undergraduates a chance to sober up before the choir sings. \n\nIn previous years students would famously undress and jump into the shallow River Cherwell from Magdalen Bridge, but this was stopped in 2005 when 40 revellers required treatment after jumping into 2ft (60cm) deep water.\n\nHowever, there are other attractions once spring has been sung in and the bells have been rung.\n\nIt's then the crowds move through the city as Morris men parade through the streets towards Radcliffe Square to begin three hours of dancing and folk music. \n\nThe Oxford University Morris Men begin the festivities by performing Bonny Green around High Street, and sides continue dancing and performing across the city until about midday. \n\nOxford City Morris Men squire Graham Diggle says 150 performers take part.\n\nIt's their annual highlight, he says, it's when the community celebrates.\nTL;DR: On most early mornings the streets of Oxford are empty, save for the odd second-year student dragging his or her intoxicated heels back to their halls of residence.\n\nArticle: The money has been secured by the Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) to turn the area into a new business district.\n\nIt is hoped the revamp will create new business and job opportunities, Local Growth Minister Andrew Percy said.\n\nMoney is also going to Bournemouth University to invest in its Orthopaedic Research Institute.\n\nThe cash will also be used on several other projects including building new homes.\n\nMr Percy said:\"These growth deals are a crucial part of our efforts to create an economy that works for everyone, and will ensure every region of the country has the chance to realise its full potential.\"\n\nThe Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) is made up of local authorities and businesses.\nTL;DR: The Lansdowne area of Bournemouth is set to benefit from part of a \u00a319.5m government investment.\n\nArticle: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has denied its request for an 11-day extension but Sainsbury's said it would appeal against the decision. \n\nThe move raised fears the \u00a315bn tie-up could be rejected when the regulator gives its final ruling next year. \n\nIt is probing whether the deal could harm competition and push up prices. \n\nSainsbury's takeover of Asda would create Britain's largest supermarket group, overtaking Tesco.\n\nIn a joint statement on Wednesday, Sainsbury's and Asda said the current timetable of the investigation did not give the retailers, or the CMA, enough time\"given the unprecedented scale and complexity of the case\". \n\nThey said they had made repeated requests for extra time after being asked for additional information at short notice.\n\n\"We are asking for an additional 11 working days to complete our responses... Without this, we will not be able to respond meaningfully to many of the key issues or have an effective oral hearing,\"they said. \n\nExplaining its decision, the CMA said the supermarket groups had been able to put their views forward since April.\n\nIt also said it had a legal obligation to complete its investigation in good time to be able to give its final ruling on 5 March 2019. \n\n\"If we gave the companies the extra time they are now asking for, it would put our ability to complete the investigation by the required deadline at very serious risk,\"a spokeswoman said.\n\n'Law unto itself'\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, told the BBC:\"I think the CMA is not well disposed to this deal and clearly today's news is a sign Sainsbury's and Asda think they're being hard done by, which suggests they're running into trouble.\n\n\"It's very hard to see how the CMA can let this deal go through,\"he added.\"Sainsbury's is trying a merger with a direct competitor and taking the big four [supermarket groups] down to three, which is something of a tipping point in competition cases.\"\n\nBut independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said the deal was not necessarily doomed.\n\nHe said the fall showed that\"the City is nervous that the CMA is being more antagonistic than expected towards the merger. And the share price had been boosted by the view that the merger would eventually be allowed to go ahead without too onerous a level of store disposals\". \n\n\"I think it's just a glitch, but the CMA is a law unto itself and nobody can be sure what it's thinking.\"\nTL;DR: Shares in Sainsbury's closed more than 5% lower after the retailer said it was seeking to delay an investigation into its proposed merger with Asda.\n\nArticle: The group of workers at food firm Arla's premises in Leeds claimed for dental care, eye care, foot care and hospital stays they never had.\n\nRingleader Kasim Mughal orchestrated the use of forged documents, which he said was\"rife at the company\".\n\nJudge Penelope Belcher jailed Mughal of Grove Rise, Leeds, for 30 months.\n\nLeeds Crown Court heard the group of six profited from the scam by submitting invoices to insurance firm Simply Health over an eight-month period and then splitting the money with Mughal.\n\n'Astonished'\n\nArla said it did not provide the insurance to the individuals.\n\nThe firm said:\"Whilst we bear no responsibility in this case, we take any matters related to fraudulent behaviour extremely seriously and remain in discussions with the colleagues concerned.\"\n\nHeather Gilmore, prosecuting, told the court it was not possible to say who devised the model for the fraud.\n\nJudge Belcher said Mughal had\"plainly a leading role in all of this and I'm astonished that somebody didn't smell a rat sooner\".\n\nThe group managed to claim \u00a312,232 over the months, although some of the sums they tried to get from Simply Health were not paid out in full.\n\nIn one claim Mughal set up a policy in the name of a man working for Arla who had no knowledge of the policy's existence or that claims were being made in his name.\n\nJailing Mughal, Judge Belcher told him:\"You say the [healthcare] fraud was rife throughout the company; you chose to join in this.\n\n\"This did not reduce your responsibility.

The leak may have been due to negligence, officials say.\n\nReports suggest initial attempts to control the gas leak were unsuccessful but the company and state officials say the situation is now under control.\n\nLG said in a statement it was investigating the cause of the incident, and was looking at ways\"to provide speedy treatment\"for those affected.\n\nRajendra Reddy, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, told the BBC that the leaked gas was styrene, which is usually refrigerated.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi called an emergency disaster meeting.\n\n'My eyes were itchy'\n\nThe leak took place at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT Wednesday) as the plant was being re-opened for the first time since 24 March, when India went into lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. \n\n\"All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,\"BK Naik, a local health official, told Reuters news agency. Doctors say 86 patients are being treated on ventilators, but many injured have been discharged.\n\nLegal action is being taken against the company, says state Industries Minister Goutam Reddy. Earlier, he told BBC Telugu that it looked as though proper procedures and guidelines were not followed when the South Korean-owned plant was being re-opened. \n\n\"We would like the company to proactively respond to the incident and ensure that the same level of responsibility is taken if this incident were to happen in EU or United States,\"he said, adding that the incident had been reported to the Korean embassy. \n\nSwaroop Rani, a senior police official in Visakhapatnam, told AFP that the plant had been left idle because of the lockdown. \n\n\"[The gas] was left there because of the lockdown. It led to a chemical reaction and heat was produced inside the tanks, and the gas leaked because of that.\"\n\nLocal villagers complained around 03:30 and police immediately went to the scene, but had to quickly retreat for fear of being poisoned, the news agency quoted her as saying.\n\n\"One could feel the gas in the air and it was not possible for any of us to stay there for more than a few minutes,\"she said.\n\nAs the gas spread, residents ran out of their homes in panic.

My wife and I rushed to the door, and found our neighbours outside, looking agitated. \n\n\"There has been an explosion at Polymers! Leave immediately,\"they told us. \n\nI could see people running on the road outside. I spotted my landlord, who also asked me to leave the house as soon as I could. Just then, I began to smell something pungent in the air. We quickly understood what had happened. The smell became stronger and my eyes began to burn. \n\nMy wife, son and I left the house on my motorbike. As we drove down the street, we saw hundreds of people were fleeing their homes. We kept going until we reached Kailasagiri beach, about 20km away. \n\nWe only stopped when we couldn't smell the gas any more.\n\nEarlier in the day, district health official Dr Naik said many people were feared to be unconscious in their homes.\n\n\"There are people who were sleeping,\"AFP quoted him as saying.\"We are working to get people to the hospital. They need oxygenation and fresh air.\n\n\"We are trying to understand the long-term impact of the chemical on those who have inhaled it during the leak.\"\n\nIn the meantime, officials have asked people to protect themselves by covering their faces with a wet cloth. The Indian navy has been helping supply oxygen to patients.\n\nIndia has a tragic history of gas leaks. \n\nIn 1984, a toxic chemical leak in a pesticide plant in the central city of Bhopal killed thousands of people, in what is acknowledged to be the world's worst industrial disaster.\n\nMore than 35 years later, victims say children are still being born with disabilities because of the effects of the methyl isocyanate gas spill.\n\nReporting by BBC Telugu's Satish Balla and Deepthi Bathini\n\nWhat is Styrene and how can exposure affect humans?\n\nSources: The PHE Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards and US Environment Protection Agency\nTL;DR: At least 11 people have been killed by a massive gas leak at a chemical plant in southern India, with 800 others taken to hospital.\n\nArticle: By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter\n\nThe manufacturer extended its safety programme to offer free replacements in July after the regulator stepped in, four years after the issue emerged.\n\nDangerous dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline brands were sold in the UK for 11 years.\n\nUp to 800,000 were estimated to still be in use when the full recall began.\n\nMachines were blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, the government has said. The fires have burnt out homes and destroyed possessions of victims - some of whom had no insurance. \n\nBefore the recall, Whirlpool primarily offered to modify affected dryers - a decision widely criticised by consumer and safety groups and which itself has led to concern over the safety of supposedly fixed machines.\n\nWhat the full recall means for consumers\n\nAnyone who thinks they bought a potentially dangerous dryer should call 0800 151 0905 or visit a dedicated website to check if their dryer is affected. If it is on the recall list, they should stop using it and unplug it immediately.\n\nThey can then choose:\n\nSince the start of the recall 65,000 affected dryers have been located, offers for a resolution have been made on 63,000 of them, with 42,000 of them having been repaired, replaced or refunded so far.\n\nWhirlpool said it took a week, on average, for customers to receive a new dryer, modification, or refund from the point they make their choice. The majority (73%) had requested a replacement, the company said.\n\n\"Nothing matters more to us than people's safety, so it is absolutely vital that we can identify where these affected dryers are and resolve the issue,\"said Jeff Noel, Whirlpool vice-president.\n\n'Our scary experience'\n\nEngineer Mark Garner and his wife Deborah owned an affected dryer and were eventually given a replacement, marked with a green sticker to identify it as safe.\n\nThen, one day, Deborah, who was in the kitchen near the dryer, smelt smoke and when she opened the dryer door she was met with a cloud of black smoke and could clearly see flames at the back of the dryer.\n\n\"The truly scary part is that, assuming this was a safe machine, it had been turned on the previous night as we went to bed,\"said Mark.\n\nThey were offered a replacement machine for \u00a399 but were so unhappy with the situation they chose a refund instead.\n\nA letter arrived, with a cheque for \u00a3220 enclosed. The trouble was, the cheque was unsigned.\n\nA signed cheque eventually arrived, two months after the incident, but only after calls to Whirlpool chasing them up for the money.\n\nInitial response'woeful'\n\nWhirlpool said the number of owners with affected machines who had contacted the company since July amid a huge awareness campaign had risen sharply from fewer than 10,000 throughout the first half of the year.\n\nIt said its campaign over the past four years had resolved the issue for more than 1.7 million people, making it up to five times more successful than a typical product recall.\n\nHowever, high-profile critics said that Whirlpool, as the owner of these brands, had a responsibility to deal with the situation adequately. Their initial response had been described as\"woeful\".\n\nRachel Reeves, who chairs the influential Business Committee of MPs, told the BBC that - despite an improvement in Whirlpool's handling of the case - concerns remained.\n\nShe said that the committee was worried about the number of potentially dangerous machines that remained in people's homes, and that the modification process was\"not as good as it should be\", with reports of supposedly safe dryers still catching fire - something which Whirlpool denies. It also wants policing of the second-hand market of white goods to be improved.\n\nShe added that the wider concerns were not helped by the lack of a fully independent product safety regulator.\nTL;DR: Some 65,000 fire-prone tumble dryers have been found during a recall campaign by Whirlpool, but hundreds of thousands still remain in UK homes.\n\nArticle: By Declan HarveyNewsbeat reporter\n\nIt says former Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan could have been\"hurt badly\"if the bird had become distressed.\n\nThe 22-year-old was put into a small room with the bird during a challenge on 15 November.\n\nOstriches are classified in the UK as dangerous animals.\n\nHowever, Klare Kennett from the RSPCA said the charity was more worried for the bird than the actress, adding:\"Helen chooses to go in there but the ostrich doesn't.\n\n\"It's a concern that these big birds are used for entertainment in this way, especially to frighten somebody.\"\n\nReports suggest it took Helen around an hour to be convinced to go into the room while the ostrich waited inside.\n\nAfter she went in, the animal could be seen opening its wings when it was startled by a loud noise.

A lot of it needs very skilled work over many years in fact.\n\n\"It also needs to have substantial research work undertaken to reveal its full significance.\n\n\"All of that is going to require resources, expertise, facilities, and in our view we are actually best-placed to provide that.\"\n\nThe Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (QLTR) - the body which rules on ownerless goods and property - decided the 10th Century artefacts should be allocated to NMS, provided it raises the funds to pay \u00a31.98m to metal detectorist Derek McLennan.\n\nHe discovered the hoard, which includes silver bracelets and brooches, a gold ring, an enamelled Christian cross and a bird-shaped gold pin, in a Dumfries and Galloway field in August 2014.\n\nMr Rintoul said NMS was in dialogue with Dumfries and Galloway Council about proposals to lend a\"representative portion\"of the hoard to the Kirkcudbright Art Gallery.\n\nBut he conceded it was\"impossible\"to say which items might be involved as significant conservation work was needed and it was unclear what material would be suitable for travel and display.\n\n\"Our plans are not that we somehow acquire and keep it all in Edinburgh, that's not the case at all,\"he said.\n\n\"Until we have actually gained possession of the hoard, which wouldn't be until we raise the money, we cannot actually undertake the survey work, the conservation assessment, to determine what can be displayed where, when and for how long.\"\n\nAsked why that work could not take place outside Edinburgh, he added:\"No-one else has the expertise.\n\n\"Dumfries and Galloway Council's museum service over the past decade has been reduced in size significantly.\n\n\"They have no conservation laboratory, no conservators and they have no curators with expertise in Viking age material.\"\nTL;DR: Scotland's national museum director has defended the decision to house in Edinburgh a 1,000-year-old Viking hoard discovered in Dumfries and Galloway.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News\n\nIt is almost a year since the robot last turned the power tool in the ground.\n\nThe vehicle has since travelled more than 5km (three miles) as it heads towards the mission's primary target - the foothills of the huge mountain that dominates Mars\u2019 Gale crater.\n\nThe rock drill was spun at a scientific waypoint known as\"The Kimberley\".\n\nNew pictures sent back to Earth on Wednesday, taken by the rover\u2019s Mahli \u201chand lens\u201d, show a sharply defined hole surrounded by a pile of grey powder.\n\nBefore turning the tool, the robot had been commanded to examine several rock targets with all its survey instruments.\n\nScientists and engineers must now assess the qualities of the powder produced. If past practice is followed, this will have been a test. \n\nAssuming it has gone satisfactorily, the rover will then acquire a second drill sample for ingesting in the robot's on-board laboratories.\n\nCuriosity last used its drill in May last year in a small depression not far from its August 2012 landing site.\n\nThe samples pulled up from mudstones at the bottom of this shallow bowl contained evidence of an ancient lake.\n\nFrom the rock chemistry, scientists were able to determine the type of environment that existed in Gale Crater billions of years ago.\n\nThe researchers said the conditions would have allowed micro-organisms to flourish had they been present. \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: The US space agency's Curiosity Mars rover has drilled another hole on the Red Planet.\n\nArticle: Its latest report says despite steady falls in unemployment, there are still 868,000 out-of-work 16 to 24-year-olds.\n\nThe latest official quarterly figures show the number of jobless young people fell by 102,000 to 767,000 in June.\n\nThey have been falling steadily for the last year.\n\nGap\n\nThe IPPR highlights a striking mismatch between what young people are training for and the types of jobs available.\n\nFor example, it says, 94,000 people were trained in beauty and hair for just 18,000 jobs, while only 123,000 were trained in the construction and engineering sectors for an advertised 275,000 jobs.\n\nThe IPPR says youth unemployment is lower in countries where the vocational route into employment through formal education and training is as clear as the academic route. \n\nIt says this helps, as it puts the two on a higher perceived footing. \n\n'Misleading'\n\nAlthough the youth unemployment rate has fallen sharply from 20.9% a year ago to 17.8%, the IPPR says there are still 868,000 unemployed young people aged 16 to 24 and 247,000 of them have been looking for work for more than a year. \n\nAbout 700,000 young people have never had a job.\n\nA Work and Pensions Department spokesperson said the IPPR's report was\"misleading\", arguing that the number of unemployed young people who are not working full time had dropped to about 530,000.\n\n\"Youth employment is up, youth unemployment has been dropping for 10 months in a row and the number of young people claiming the main unemployment benefit has dropped for 31 months in a row to around 250,000,\"a spokesperson said.\n\nTony Dolphin, IPPR chief economist, said:\"We can learn lots from countries like Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n\"A strong workplace-based vocational education and training system, with high employer involvement, contributes more to a smoother transition from education to work and a low rate of youth unemployment than anything else.\"\n\nThe official figures are expected to show another fall in unemployment and in the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance.\nTL;DR: Centre-left think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) says that a full-blown economic recovery will not resolve the UK's youth unemployment problem.\n\nArticle: The rate of assaults fell by 16%, while failed drug tests also dropped across the 10 prisons that were given \u00a310m extra security funding in 2018.\n\nBut in three of the jails, Hull, Nottingham and Wormwood Scrubs, the rate of assaults increased.\n\nEx-minister Rory Stewart had vowed to resign if the prisons did not improve.\n\nHowever, he was promoted to secretary of state for international development in May and then resigned in July anyway over Boris Johnson's Brexit plans, before the impact of the project on drugs and violence levels was known.\n\nThe percentage of failed drug tests across the 10 prisons halved between August 2018 and March this year, the MoJ said, although its report pointed out that the number of prisoners sampled was small.\n\nAs part of the scheme - given the name the\"10 Prisons Project\"by the MoJ - governors were given extra funds to spend on measures including for new X-ray body scanners, sniffer dogs, extra staff and basic repairs.\n\nThe MoJ said the project, which ran for a year from June 2018, had now finished but added that it would form\"part of our continuing efforts to boost safety, security and decency in all prisons\".\n\nThe figures showed that the rate of assaults per 1,000 prisoners across the 10 jails fell from 42.9 in the three months to August last year to 36.1 in the quarter to June - a decrease of around 16%, compared with a drop of roughly 8% across all prisons in England and Wales.\n\nLucy Frazer - who replaced Mr Stewart as prisons minister - said she was\"encouraged\"by the new figures.\n\n\"We are already using what has worked to improve the rest of the estate, spending \u00a3100m on airport-style security to stop the scourge of mobile phones and drugs that fuel crime and disorder in jails,\"she added.\n\nBut critics of the scheme said the MoJ's project did not go far enough.\n\nThe chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, Frances Cook, said the measures\"will fail to deliver if prisoners are given nothing to do and released with nowhere to live\".\n\nShe added:\"Tightening security in a few troubled prisons is all well and good, but ministers will have to take a different approach if they want to tackle the problems in more than 100 jails across the country.\"\n\nThe charity Prison Reform Trust welcomed the reduction in violence but warned that the 10 prisons project and the fate of a prisons minister\"always risked being a distraction from the real issue\"of overcrowding.\n\nA spokesman added:\"Any glimmers of systemic improvement will be quickly snuffed out if we return to the failed'prison works' policies that have created this calamity in the first place.\"\n\n The government has also pledged to recruit thousands of extra prison officers and create 10,000 additional prison places in England and Wales.\nTL;DR: Levels of violence and drug taking have fallen since last year at some of England's \"most challenging\" prisons, the  Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said.\n\nArticle: We Are One: A Global Film Festival, will be hosted by YouTube from 29 May.\n\nIt comes after coronavirus caused disruption to many international events, as the film industry ground to a halt.\n\nThe 10-day digital alternative will help to raise funds for the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund and beyond.\n\nTwenty festivals from around the world are involved including BFI London Film Festival, Jerusalem Film Festival, Mumbai Film Festival and Marrakech International Film Festival, as well as Sundance Film Festival and Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nTribeca, co-founded by Robert De Niro (pictured above) and Jane Rosenthal in New York, have joined forces with the streaming giants to put on the online event after having been forced to postpone this year's festival.\n\nThey hope it\"unites curators, artists and storytellers to entertain and provide relief to audiences worldwide\".\n\n'Inspiring and uniting'\n\n\"We often talk about film's uniquely powerful role in inspiring and uniting people across borders and differences to help heal the world,\"said Rosenthal.\n\n\"All of the world needs healing right now.\"\n\nThe free event will include films, shorts, documentaries, music, comedy, and conversations and a full schedule will be available nearer to next month's event.\n\nAccording to Deadline, there aren't expected to be any films scheduled for upcoming 2020 festivals for financial and rights reasons. \n\nLast month, the Cannes Film Festival was also postponed due to lockdown concerns around the virus.

and that's all changed much faster than the climate.\"\n\nAlthough individual studies and reports down the years have flagged up climate change as likely to increase the spread of malaria markedly, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report did not.\n\nIt concluded that although climatic change would alter the prospects for malaria, science could not yet predict where, when and how.\n\nClimate change was very likely to\"have mixed effects on malaria; in some places the geographical range will contract, elsewhere the geographical range will expand and the transmission season may be changed,\"it concluded.\n\nWhile correlations had been observed between disease transmission and local climate changes in some regions,\"there is still much uncertainty about the potential impact of climate change on malaria at local and global scales,\"it said.\nTL;DR: Climate change will have a tiny impact on malaria compared with our capacity to control the disease, a study finds.\n\nArticle: Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanBBCon Twitter\n\nThese are the two fundamental questions at the heart of the revelation that 50 million Facebook users allegedly had their personal data harvested by Cambridge Analytica, following investigations by Channel 4 News, The Observer and The New York Times.\n\nIf the answers are\"no\"and\"yes\"respectively, as all the early evidence appears to indicate, the implications are immense.\n\nThis story is given oomph by the question of who knew what and when. Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica has been accused of deliberately misleading a parliamentary Select Committee. He denies the allegation. Chris Wylie, the Canadian whistle-blower, has said that Facebook about the  scale of the data breach two years ago. While he claims tens of millions of users have been targeted, the company, which denies any wrongdoing, says it did not harvest Facebook data. They cannot both be right.\n\nThe deeper currents behind the story are economic and political, and relate to the way in which the internet has made data the most valuable commodity of our time.\n\nI have written elsewhere that data is not the new oil. But there is no doubt that economic history has reached a point where the owners of vast troves of data, most of it given to them by unthinking consumers, are the corporate titans of the age. This is a vast over-simplification, but in the transition from an agrarian, to an industrial, to a knowledge and service economy, and now to a data economy, we have seen the emergence of what some top economists call the weightless world. \n\nIt isn't hard objects - material stuff - that has made the likes of Facebook extremely rich. It is personal data. Of course we have a mixed economy, with different sectors attaining growth and wealth in different ways. \n\nBut a few superstar firms have acquired unprecedented wealth and power through their use of the personal data we give them each time we use their services. One aspect of this phenomenon that doesn't get the attention it deserves is that, compared to the corporate titans of the past, these superstar firms don't actually employ many people.\n\nThe other aspect that is coming to light is that there is so much data, and it is so capable of being scraped by smart computer geeks, that it may not be safe. This - perhaps more than the spread of fake news and disinformation - is the sense in which Facebook has unleashed something it may not be able to fully control. \n\nIt is almost funny how Facebook has denied this is a data\"breach\". The company says it granted Aleksandre Kogan, the Cambridge academic, permission to access information, but that in sharing it with Nix's firm and allowing it to be used for commercial purposes, he broke the terms of the licence. Facebook has now suspended the company and Wylie from their social media platform.\n\nIn their statement, they say:\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"Even if all that is true, it displays a tin ear for public sentiment. The company says it learned about the issue in 2015 and removed Kogan's app while adding the data should be destroyed. This, it seems, wasn't complied with. \n\nCall it a breach, hack, theft, robbery, harvesting or plain old profiling, what is going on is simple. In under a decade-and-a-half, Facebook has acquired a market capitalisation of over half a trillion dollars by providing an excellent free service. In return for this free service, it uses our personal data to let advertisers target us with messages. With over two billion users, each of them leaving a digital trail with every like, click, share and post, that's a lot of data. Data is hard to control at the best of times. At this volume, it can end in places it shouldn't.\n\nThe old saying that\"if it's free online, you are the product\", has merit. In effect, Facebook's free service, which no human being, company or institution is compelled to use, is a mass surveillance tool. There are very legitimate fears among the public about the safety of their data. This story, whose force derives in part from the fact that the main actors have denied wrongdoing throughout, will heighten such fears.\n\nAnd then there is the question of its impact on our polity and politics. Cambridge Analytica have denied doing any work on the Brexit referendum. And while it is true that Nix saw the Republican Party as a great opportunity, has links to Breitbart through his board, and was funded by Robert Mercer, the libertarian supporter of Donald Trump, this isn't really a left v right issue. \n\nPresident Obama's team used Facebook to target voters a decade ago, albeit with different techniques (and no suggestion of wrongdoing). A Cambridge Analytica employee has in the past told me that his company works for liberals around the world too. \n\nBut there are important laws and regulations preventing interference in democratic politics. The Information Commissioner in the UK is examining what role if any the company had in the Brexit referendum. In the US, it is possible that the company acted within the letter and even the spirit of the law - though many will debate the matter. And it may be the case that the influence of this company is much overblown.\n\nThat companies are using our digital footprints to harvest data and target us for commercial or political purposes should, however, prompt deeper consideration of the implicit contract between consumers and technology companies. \n\nA new era is upon us, in which the data of masses have made a few firms massively rich. The masses need to think harder about what that means for them.\nTL;DR: Is our personal data safe? And might it be used by individuals, companies or governments to influence the democratic process?\n\nArticle: As a result, overall exhaust emissions from new cars have been increasing, not declining, for the past three years, says the UK Energy Research Centre.\n\nSUV sales are jeopardising the UK transport sector's ability to meet EU emissions targets, it said.\n\nProf Jillian Anable of the UKERC said this made\"a mockery\"of UK policy.\n\n\"Effectively, we have been sleepwalking into the issue,\"she said.\n\n\"The decarbonisation of the passenger car market can no longer rely on a distant target to stop the sales of conventional engines. We must start to phase out the most polluting vehicles immediately. \n\n\"It is time to enact a strong set of regulations to transform the entire car market towards ultra-low carbon, rather than focusing solely on the uptake of electric vehicles.\"\n\nUKERC was founded in 2004 and is funded by UK Research and Innovation, the UK government's research and innovation funding agency.\n\nIt carries out research into sustainable future energy systems.\n\nOver the past four years, there have been 1.8 million SUV sales, compared to a total of 47,000 for battery electric vehicles (BEV). \n\nIn 2018, SUVs accounted for 21.2% of new car sales, up from 13.5% three years earlier.\n\nHowever, BEV sales are coming from a low base, as the technology is still relatively new.\n\n\"SUVs are larger and heavier than a standard car, emitting about a quarter more CO2 than a medium-size car and nearly four times more than a medium-sized battery electric vehicle,\"said the UKERC. \n\n\"Assuming the majority of these SUVs will be on UK roads for at least a decade, it is estimated the extra cumulative emissions to total around 8.2 million tons of CO2.\"\n\nThe UKERC said the\"extraordinary leap\"in SUV sales over the past four years seemed to be due to\"attractive car financing packages which divert attention from running costs\".\n\nAlthough vehicle excise duty is higher for gas-guzzlers, more than 90% of new cars in the UK are now sold by way of deals that wrap the excise duty into the monthly cost,\"rendering the only clear policy signal to discourage high-carbon vehicles somewhat useless,\"it said.\n\nAll-electric vehicles still represent only a fraction of total car sales. The UKERC said they remained at less than 1% of new car sales in 2019.\n\nThere are also challenges to uptake, including a lack of charging points on roads and too few low-cost models.  \n\nThe UKERC warned against abandoning the EU's emissions targets after Brexit, although no political party is currently advocating this.\n\nIt said EU regulations had been structured to allow makers of larger, heavier cars to have higher levels of emissions per km.\n\n\"Yet, despite its flaws, there are dangers of Britain choosing not to align with the EU vehicle regulations post-Brexit,\"it added.\n\nRAC spokesman Simon Williams said:\"It's important to remember that the SUV trend has been developing for around two decades, arguably really taking off in the mid-2000s, whereas the electric vehicle (EV) market is only just beginning to accelerate as battery technology improves, along with the availability of public charge points. \n\n\"As a result, there are some very strong EV sports utility vehicles on sale now.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said:\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and dual-purpose cars are an increasingly popular choice, available in a range of sizes, and valued for their style, practicality, higher ride and commanding view of the road. \n\n\"Thanks to ongoing investment, like all vehicles, they're also ever more efficient, with average CO2 emissions from new dual-purpose cars having fallen more than 43% on 2000 levels.\"\n\nThey're tall, spacious, and styled to look as though they belong halfway up a mountain, even though most will never ever venture more than a few metres off-road. \n\nSUVs are undoubtedly popular with drivers. But they're also big and heavy - and that means they emit more CO2 than smaller cars. \n\nBut it would be wrong to see these figures as a sign that the market doesn't want more environmentally friendly vehicles.\n\nTo put it simply, most people still drive petrol or diesel cars, and if they want a bigger car, right now they'll probably choose a petrol or diesel SUV, because they're familiar and widely available.\n\nBut just take a look at the tiny, yet rapidly growing market for electric cars. Among the models now on the market are the Kia e-Niro, Hyundai's Kona Electric, the Jaguar I-Pace, the Audi E-tron and the Mercedes EQ.\n\nAll of them are SUVs. The manufacturers think they can surf the wave of enthusiasm for big cars - and use it to sell more electric vehicles. \n\nThe two are certainly not mutually exclusive.\nTL;DR: The \"immense\" rise in sales of high-emission sports utility vehicles means they now outsell electric cars in the UK by 37 to one, research has found.\n\nArticle: Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock, 64, was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault over allegations of improper behaviour towards a female constituent.\n\nHis website said he went voluntarily to a police station on Tuesday.

by one of the American special forces soldiers.\n\nJohn and Lorna Norgrove spent seven hours with UK and US officers going through the findings.\n\nThey said watching the video of the rescue had been\"harrowing\".\n\nMs Norgrove was taken hostage in September and died during the rescue effort on 8 October.\n\nHer parents, who live on Lewis, in the Western Isles, have waited until now to comment on the investigation.\n\nForeign Secretary William Hague released the findings in a statement to the House of Commons last week.\n\nThe Norgroves were given a presentation on the inquiry and they said it went into considerable detail about what happened during the rescue.\n\nMr Norgrove said:\"I looked at an overhead video that was actually taken during the rescue where we could see the soldiers advancing and the hostages coming out of buildings and it was quite harrowing.\n\n\"It was a difficult thing to go through but I feel at the end of it we got a really good picture of what happened.\"\n\nHe added:\"After the seven hours we still had a couple of questions and one of the officers came back to answer our questions the next day. \n\n\"So, we are convinced that we've had a good and honest account of the actual rescue itself.\"\n\nThey said the investigation report was\"full and honest\"but they continued to have concerns about events leading up to the rescue, which were not covered by the probe.\n\nAn inquest into Ms Norgrove's death was opened and adjourned by Wiltshire coroner David Ridley in Salisbury in October.\n\nMr Norgrove said the inquest was due to resume in January next year.\n\nHe added:\"We hope that this will concentrate both on the rescue and on the events leading up to the rescue because this wasn't covered in any detail by the military

Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it did not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nEnergy firm Corallian previously said it had found\"extensive\"reserves of oil during

the run\"on 1970's After The Gold Rush. Two decades later, he warned that pollution and deforestation would\"trade away our children's days\"on Mother Earth.\n\nThe latter is reprised on his new album, Earth, an environmentally-themed live album that - unusually - overdubs his performances with the sounds of the animal kingdom, from bees to buzzards; and cows to cockerels.\n\nIt sounds like folly, but the effect is strangely mesmerising - as if the stage is slowly being invaded and overrun by the natural world. \n\n\"It's about the connectivity of everything,\"Young tells the BBC.\"Trying to be cognisant of how living things are affected by what we do.\"\n\n\"This is something that matters to me. The more people that pay attention to activism and environmentalism, the better off we're going to be. \n\n\"I mean, we're in kind of dire straits as far as the governments go. It's really down to the people.\"\n\nYoung's frustrations with government are far from secret, of course. He publicly remonstrated Donald Trump for using his music on the campaign trail - saying he would never\"endorse hate, bigotry, childish name calling, the superficiality of celebrity or ignorance\".\n\nBut his dissatisfaction runs deeper than one candidate. He is disillusioned with the entire political process.\n\n\"If corporate money and television advertising [are] the only way to really get elected, then you have a way where democracy can be corrupted by power - and that's what we have in the United States,\"he says. \n\n\"That results in decisions being made that are written by corporations, that the legislators pass as law. Things like the anti-labelling campaigns of the GMO (genetically modified organism) manufacturers. Things like that.\"\n\nThe star's anger at agribusiness - and patented, genetically-modified seeds in particular - fuelled his last album, The Monsanto Years.  \n\n\"The seeds of life are not what they once were / Mother Nature and God don't own them anymore,\"he sang on the title track; while Big Box took aim at big business in general -\"Too big to fail / Too rich for jail\".\n\nBoth songs are revived on Earth, with Young's fury fuelling the gritty live performances. Several of the songs have subsequently been augmented in the studio, with Young adding a chorus of perfectly-harmonised singers to emphasise key lyrics. They represent the sound of\"corporate harmony\", he says. \n\n\"Aren't they perfect and beautiful? It's a little bit disturbing how good they are. \n\n\"You know as soon as you hear them, that you can't believe it - but you need to listen to them over and over again because they've hooked you.\"\n\nAnd those animal sounds? Young largely recorded them himself. \n\n\"I do listen a lot to nature,\"he says.\"Where I live, the birds are very vocal.\"\n\nThe star's connection to nature runs deeper still. Since the late 1970s, he has only recorded music in the week leading up to a full moon (although, being a live album, Earth is an exception).\n\n\"It's kind of paganistic [but] it is productive,\"he says.\"As I look back over the archives, the dates coincide.\n\n\"A lot of people on Earth go by the moon, whether they know it or not. Planting seeds or cutting your hair - do things at the right time and there's a difference.\"\n\nBut Young isn't deluded about his abilities. Inspiration is\"like a flame that burns and then goes out\", he says.\n\n\"I look at it like there's an energy that floats around. Sometimes some people have it, and sometimes other people have it.\n\n\"Like, Adele had it for a period of time and really held it in her hand and was doing great things with it. I hope she gets to hold onto it - but no-one can hold onto it for long.\n\n\"It's just kind of a crapshoot, really.\"\n\nNonetheless, since his beginnings with Buffalo Springfield 50 years ago, Young has carved out one of the longest and most vital careers in rock. His writing is perhaps more uncompromising now than it was in his most commercially-successful period, with After The Gold Rush and Harvest in the early 1970s.\n\nLater this year, he will take the stage with five other rock legends - including Bob Dylan and Sir Paul McCartney - at the Desert Trip festival in California.\n\nThe event is expected to have the biggest box-office takings in concert history, but Young (who turned down $1m to headline Woodstock in 1994) plays down the significance of the show.\n\n\"I know nothing about it really. I've been asked to do a gig, and I'm going to do it,\"he says.\n\n\"It's great they asked me to play with all those artists. That's wonderful, it's a great honour to play with all of them. But aside from that, it's just another gig.\"\n\nEarth is released on 24 June by Warner Bros Records.

not just in London and the South East\"as it was in the last few weeks\". \n\nThe health secretary said the government didn't\"take these tiering decisions lightly\", but warned the new variant\"has made suppressing the virus much harder\".\n\nAsked whether ministers were considering a national lockdown, Mr Hancock said the tier was system was implemented\"because not everywhere needs the same level of restrictions\".\n\nHe also urged people to\"stay in this new year\"regardless of what tier their local area is under - in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nIt comes as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for use in the UK.\n\nOn Tuesday, 53,135 new Covid cases were recorded in the UK - the highest single day rise since mass testing began - as well as 414 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test.\n\nThe West Midlands and Hartlepool are among the areas that could be affected by the tier changes.\n\nParts of the East Midlands, such as Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, as well as all areas of the West Midlands metropolitan county are other areas which could move into tier four.\n\nAnd it is thought a handful of areas in Lancashire - Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Pendle and Ribble Valley - could be upgraded from tier three.\n\nThere may also be further curbs for areas already in the highest tier amid concerns that tier four rules are not enough to stop the fast-spreading new virus variant. \n\nAbout 40% of people in England, including London, parts of the East of England and much of the South East, are currently in tier four.\n\nUnder these rules, non-essential shops, beauty salons and hairdressers must close, and people are limited to meeting in a public outdoor place with their household, or one other person.\n\nMeanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is due to make a statement in the House of Commons after 15:30 GMT on schools returning in January, with the exact timing depending on earlier business including the Brexit debate. \n\nAsked about the plans earlier, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:\"Clearly we want to protect education as much as possible. But the new variant does make it much easier for this disease to transmit.\"\n\nIt comes after government advisers suggested keeping secondary schools closed - or staggering their reopening - would help drive down infections next month.\n\nInfectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson has said that while\"nobody wants to keep schools shut\", it may be the only alternative\"to having exponentially growing numbers of hospitalisations\"- which are now at record levels in England and Wales.\n\nHe said that because the new virus variant, initially discovered in Kent, appeared to be much more transmissible, it was possible closing schools might not be enough to stop the spread.\n\nAnother adviser, Prof Andrew Hayward, said a staggered return to classrooms might be appropriate if schools reopened and\"we're going to have to have increased, strict restrictions in other areas of society to pay for that\".\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the government should confirm its plan for schools and colleges, with just two working days before the new term begins for many on Monday.\n\nA No 10 spokesman said the government was\"still planning for a staggered opening\"of secondary schools, but\"we obviously keep all measures under constant review\".\n\nPreliminary research by Public Health England has found no evidence the new variant is more able to infect children than other variants, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle says.\n\nIn other developments: \n\nFigures from NHS England showed there were 21,787 patients in NHS hospitals in England as of 08:00 on Tuesday, compared with 20,426 on Monday and 18,974 at the first wave peak on 12 April.\n\nFive of the seven NHS regions in England are currently reporting a record number of Covid-19 hospital patients: Eastern, London, Midlands, South East and South West.\n\nThe other two regions, North East and North West, remain below peak levels that were set in mid-November.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was vital people did not mix indoors with other households, including at Hogmanay, amid level four restrictions across mainland areas.\n\nPolice in Wales turned away visitors to the Brecon Beacons, some of whom had travelled from as far away as London.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann warned of a\"significant rise\"in Covid cases among younger adults aged 20 to 39.\n\nHow have you been affected by the issues in this story?

They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population. \n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Forced or voluntary, their exile is designed to avoid conflict or civil war.  \n\nFrance, with its colonial history in Africa, is a popular destination. Two former presidents of the Central African Republic spent time there, as did the family of Rwandan autocrat Juvenal Habyarimana.\n\nOthers are guided by their political sympathies.\n\nErich Honecker for 19 years leader of the Socialist Unity Party in East Germany, fled first to Moscow, then to Chile, after the Berlin Wall came down. \n\nIn 1986, the 20-year reign of Ferdinand Marcos was brought to a close after four days of protests on the streets of Manila. US President Ronald Reagan, a former ally, urged him to step down and he fled the Philippines for Hawaii.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a good bet for ex-dictators with few friends left. Uganda's Idi Amin spent 24 years there before his death in 2003. And eight years on he was followed by Tunisian ex-President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who found nowhere in Africa would take him. \n\nIs it bad PR for the host country? \n\nDoes sheltering a deposed leader damage the host country's image? The answer is: not usually. Most fallen leaders are only interested in a quiet retirement (and in some cases, avoiding the scrutiny of the International Criminal Court). \n\nOffering exiles asylum can be good for diplomatic relations, with the host nation praised by its peers for\"taking one for the team\".\n\nWhen Mr Ben Ali arrived in Saudi Arabia, for example, the kingdom issued a carefully worded statement.\n\n\"Out of concern for the exceptional circumstances facing the brotherly Tunisian people and in support of the security and stability of their country... the Saudi government has welcomed President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and his family to the kingdom,\"it read.\n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, African nations may be happy to take Robert Mugabe, but balk at the idea of his firebrand wife, Grace. The 52-year-old has made her political ambitions very plain and potential hosts may worry she would use their territory as a base to interfere in Zimbabwe - thus damaging relations.\n\nWhere could Mugabe go?\n\nThe Mugabe family own property in Malaysia, South Africa and possibly Dubai - but Africa-watchers say the patriarch may aim for Singapore.\n\n\"He's got numerous options,\"observes Dr Phil Clark, an African politics specialist at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\n\n\"He's been going [to Singapore] a lot for medical treatment for more than a decade now, and he seems to have a pretty good relationship with the Singaporean authorities.\"\n\nThe fact that Mr Mugabe is not fleeing a bloody coup but negotiating peacefully with the army and people inside his own party, Zanu-PF, is likely to help his chances. \n\nSouth Africa is the other main contender, as Mr Mugabe has a strong relationship with President Jacob Zuma and historic links to the country. \n\n\"I think Zuma's going to find that pretty difficult to justify to his own electorate and party at the moment. I think that one's probably not going to happen,\"Dr Clark says.\n\nSouth Africa is also a risk for Grace Mugabe. In August, the First Lady was granted diplomatic immunity over claims that she had assaulted a model at a Johannesburg hotel where her sons were staying. But if her husband leaves power, that protection will evaporate too.\n\nHe may not leave Africa\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time leader had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. Despite that he is still popular on the continent and seen by some as a liberation hero.\n\nTogo, Equatorial Guinea and Morocco all have past form for taking in exiled presidents, if Mr Mugabe is minded to stay within Africa. \n\nIronically perhaps, Zimbabwe has welcomed more than one\"difficult\"diplomatic exile too. Ethiopia's Mengistu Haile Mariam, who executed thousands of suspected opponents during the 1970s, has enjoyed a lavish life in asylum thanks to his friendship with Mr Mugabe.\nTL;DR: President Robert Mugabe famously declared that he would cling to power in Zimbabwe \"until God says 'Come'\". And at the age of 93, he might have expected that hour to arrive before a human intervention.\n\nArticle: Tamara Thurgood struggled to pull the snake off her son after it bit him repeatedly on the face while he slept, relatives said online.\n\nMs Thurgood told local media it was\"like a nightmare\"as she fought to free her son.\n\nShe said Tyler, 6, had his eyes closed during the ordeal and could not remember being bitten.\n\nTwo male relatives who were called to the property at Eungai Rail in northern New South Wales killed the snake.\n\nSnake experts described the encounter with what was probably a 2.5m (8ft) coastal carpet python as an\"unfortunate chance meeting\".\n\nBryan Robinson, a wildlife management specialist for Queensland Fauna Consultancy, told the BBC it was an unusual scenario.\n\nMr Robinson said snakes usually bite for self defence, and around 95% of people bitten were either trying to catch or kill the reptile.\n\n\"It doesn't mean the snake was attacking him, the kid could have rolled on him in his sleep,\"he said.\"Human beings do not fit into the prey selection of any Australian snakes.\"\n\nRelatives said Ms Thurgood wanted to share her story online in the hope it would help other families protect their children. She has since asked for privacy.\nTL;DR: An Australian mother woke to the sound of her son's screams and found a python wrapped around his belly.\n\nArticle: Across Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr convictions rose from 23 in 2011 to 76 in 2012, while they went up from 19 to 59 in north east Wales.\n\nElsewhere, a man from Pembroke Dock was jailed for nearly five months after the death of his dog and iguana.\n\nThe charity said total convictions across Wales were up 4% to nearly 250.\n\nThe RSPCA said there was also a 20% rise in reported cases of cruelty, up from 146 to 174, and a 20% increase in the numbers of cautions issued to pet owners.\n\nThe charity's Welsh director Steve Carter said:\"Some areas in Wales have seen a disturbing increase in cruelty cases and this is a major cause of concern for us.\n\n\"The RSPCA is leading the fight against a growing animal cruelty crisis. Our staff, volunteers and branches show tremendous dedication but they are struggling to keep up.\n\n\"For us, prosecution is always the last resort. However, last year inspectors investigated 174 suspected cruelty cases and secured 248 convictions.\n\n\"Where there is evidence of a crime and serious animal abuse then we will take legal action to protect the animals and prevent further abuse. We also want to see courts taking these offences far more seriously.\"\n\nThe charity found a steep rise in animal cruelty convictions from 2011 to 2012:\n\nAcross England and Wales, convictions for animal neglect and cruelty in cases brought by the RSPCA rose by a third last year.\n\nLast year the RSPCA said those convicted of animal cruelty in Wales had increased by more than a third in 2011, while those convicted of the same crime in Wales and England rose by nearly a quarter. \n\nThe charity said at the time it was facing a funding crisis as a result of having to deal with so many cases, and its resources were being stretched.\nTL;DR: Criminal convictions for animal neglect and cruelty have more than trebled in parts of Wales as the RSPCA warns of a growing crisis.\n\nArticle: By Ben Morris & Daniele Palumbo Business Reporters\n\nBut that resurgence is favouring the Labour Party.\n\nJust two years ago, the split in support between Labour and the Conservatives among 18 to 29-year-olds was fairly even, 36% to 32%.\n\nBut in June's general election that gap widened dramatically, with Labour taking a 64% share to the Tories' 21%, according to pollsters YouGov.\n\nSo with the Budget coming up on 22 November, where could the Chancellor take action to attract the younger voter?\n\nHousing\n\nThe number of young people living at home has been rising.\n\nIn 1996, around 2.7 million, or 21%, of those aged between 20 and 34 were living at home. That figure has risen to 3.4 million or 26% in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nFor young men the proportion is even higher, at 32%.\n\nThat rise is partly due to more young people staying in education and training, but also due to the increased costs of buying or renting a home.\n\nIn October, Prime Minister Theresa May promised to fix the\"broken\"housing market and earmarked another \u00a32bn to build council houses and affordable homes for rent.\n\nBut Labour and housing charities said the plan would only help a fraction of the 1.2 million families awaiting housing.\n\nPay\n\nFor decades after World War Two young people could expect to be better off than their parents at comparable ages. \n\nBut some data shows recent generations have been doing worse than their predecessors.\n\nIf you look at the chart below, the age at which Baby Boomers and Generation X, started earning \u00a3400 per week consistently fell. But for millennials that age started to rise.\n\nHowever,  more recent data shows that pay for younger people has been holding up well over the past 10 years. Younger generations have seen pay growth that is roughly comparable to older workers, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Pay for younger workers has been supported by rises in minimum wage.\n\nEducation\n\nIt's not all grim news for today's young people. They are going on to higher education in greater numbers than previous generations.\n\nIn 1950, just 3.4% of the population had been to university. \n\nAs the chart above indicates, there has been a dramatic rise in higher education participation since then.\n\nIn England, the higher education participation rate for 17-20 year olds rose to 42% in 2016, from 33% in 2006.\n\nHowever, there are questions over whether there is demand for those graduates.\n\nThe Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) estimates that for those who left in the 2015 university year, 48% ended up in non-graduate jobs six months on.\n\nBut at least the jobs market is strong. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.3%, the lowest in 42 years.\n\nDebt\n\nBut that higher education comes at a cost. Tuition fees were first introduced in 1998 and since then have risen to more than \u00a39,000 in England. In Scotland young people do not pay university tuition fees.\n\nIf you include that student debt, then young people have very high levels of unsecured debt. \n\nThe chart above is based on recent survey data analysed by PWC. It found that on average 25 to 34-year-olds hold debt equivalent to more than 50% of their income.\n\nOf course you could argue that student loans are not as onerous as other forms of debt, as it is only paid back once the graduate gets a job earning more than \u00a321,000 a year.\n\nNevertheless, it is a financial burden that previous generations have not had to carry.\n\nIn October, the government announced that tuition fees in England would be frozen at \u00a39,250 a year. It will also raise the earnings threshold at which graduates have to start paying tax to \u00a325,000 in April 2018.\nTL;DR: More young people are voting than at any time in the last quarter of a century.\n\nArticle: By Niall GlynnBBC News NI \n\n\"Now the border's a virtual reality\"is the Belfast Telegraph's front page headline.\n\nIt says there are plans for a post-Brexit digital border, with high-tech equipment ensuring there would be no checkpoints.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in describe Brexit Secretary David Davis' proposal as\"laughable\".\n\nHowever, the DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson accuses Sinn F\u00e9in of acting like\"doom and gloom merchants\".\n\nStaying on political matters, the News Letter leads with veteran Ulster Unionist Samuel Gardiner's prediction that party leader Mike Nesbitt could disappear from Northern Ireland politics and\"he may drag the once great Ulster Unionist Party with him\".\n\nMr Gardiner describes Mr Nesbitt's statement about transferring votes to the SDLP as\"political suicide\".\n\nThe former MLA says it looks like a single unionist party could now emerge.\n\nMeanwhile, the front page of the Irish News features a plea for Northern Ireland's politicians to take mental health issues more seriously.\n\nHester Glenn's son Jack remains missing six weeks after going into the River Foyle.\n\nMrs Glenn, who works as a carer, says she does not feel there is enough help available for young people with mental health issues or depression.\n\n\"Politicians need to sit down and take mental health more seriously,\"she says. \n\nHammer and baseball bat attack\n\nThe Mirror leads with an attack on a man in a bar in Doagh, County Antrim, on Wednesday night.\n\nIt says four men walked into the pub armed with baseball bats and hammers and attacked the victim.\n\nThe attack is believed to be linked to a loyalist feud in Carrickfergus in which 44-year-old Geordie Gilmore was shot dead.\n\nInside, the News Letter, Irish News and Belfast Telegraph all have the story of a Fermanagh mother's outrage after her son's school put her son\"into isolation\"due to his haircut.\n\nSandra Miskimmin says her son Henry was punished by Enniskillen Royal Grammar School after getting what she described as a\"short, back and sides\".\n\nMrs Miskimmin took to social media in protest and asked:\"Do you think my son's hair is too short?\"\n\nShe accuses the school of a\"1900s style approach\"and says she has received dozens of messages of support.\n\nThe school says it is an internal matter and is being dealt with.\n\nBilly's long walk\n\nThe start of courageous Castlederg boy Billy Caldwell's 150-mile walk to fund vital treatment in America is marked in The Irish News.\n\nLast month, Billy returned from Los Angeles after six months of cannabis oil treatment to control his life-threatening epilepsy seizures.\n\n\"He's in really high spirits and the response from people on the route has  been really good,\"his mum Charlotte tells the paper.\n\nMeanwhile, the News Letter says unionists have branded projected costs for an Irish language act as\"absurd\"\n\nConradh na Gaeilge says the cost would be \u00a319m for the five-year introductory phase. \n\nHowever, the DUP's Nelson McCausland tells the paper the figure is completely unrealistic.\n\n'I will find you'\n\nFinally, it seems that some of Northern Ireland's actors are often the victims of mistaken identity.\n\nAdrian Dunbar tells the Belfast Telegraph he was constantly mistaken for Liam Neeson - being greeted in the street as Mr Neeson or just Liam - until his new found-fame from starring in the TV series Line of Duty.\n\nRather more bizarrely, the paper says that, in the past, Neeson was frequently mistaken for Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\n\nBe warned, if you make that comparison he will look for you, he will find you and he will ask you how you could mistake a Ballymena man for a cigar-chomping Latin American revolutionary.\nTL;DR: A digital Irish border, mental health issues, the future of Mike Nesbitt and more violence linked to a loyalist feud make the front pages on Thursday.\n\nArticle: Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, visiting Budapest, said remains would be sent to Israel for a Jewish burial.\n\nIn late 1944 pro-Nazi Arrow Cross fascists murdered thousands of Jews in Budapest, shooting many on the banks of the Danube.\n\nThey were among some 565,000 Hungarian Jews who died in the Holocaust.\n\nZaka, an Israeli victim identification group, is set to begin the search later this week.

That future is now in jeopardy.\"\n\nHe added:\"The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a two-state solution, but his current coalition is the most right-wing in Israeli history with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements.\n\n\"The result is that policies of this government, which the prime minister himself just described as more committed to settlements than any Israel's history, are leading in the opposite direction. They are leading towards one state.\"\n\nIn his reply, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was disappointed with the US secretary of state's speech, which he said was\"unbalanced\". \n\nMr Kerry, he said, had\"paid lip service to the unremitting Palestinian campaign of terrorism\"against Israel.\n\nThe conflict, Mr Netanyahu added, centred on the Palestinians' refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, but Mr Kerry\"does not see the simple truth\". \n\nA spokeswoman for the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, Hanan Ashrawi, told the BBC that Palestinians had adhered to past agreements but the Israelis had not.\n\n\"We have accepted the two-state solution and we've acted accordingly and we have honoured all our commitments as per the declaration of principles and the agreements,\"she said.\n\n\"Unfortunately it's Israel that has violated all its commitments, all the agreements and that is constantly now stepping up, as John Kerry said... its settlement activities and in an insane manner that is... specifically planned to destroy the two-state solution.\"\n\nMore to come? By Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent\n\nBarack Obama began his presidency with a flurry of diplomacy aimed at breaking the Arab-Israeli deadlock. It did not work and pretty soon, a succession of Arab revolutions and wars gave the president more pressing things to think about. \n\nNow, at the eleventh hour, another flurry, which has angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n\nBut could it help set the scene for future diplomacy? France is organising a peace conference in mid-January and it has been suggested that decisions taken there could form the basis of another UN resolution before 20 January, when President Obama leaves office. \n\nHowever, Donald Trump has made it clear he has no plans to push Israel into a corner. \n\nIn two tweets issued on Wednesday morning New York time, Mr Trump said:\"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect. \n\n\"They used to have a great friend in the US, but... not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (UN)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\"\n\nCritics have urged the president-elect to use more conventional channels to communicate on international matters.\n\nMr Netanyahu replied on Twitter:\"President-elect Trump, thank you for your warm friendship and your clear-cut support for Israel!\"\n\nThe UN resolution passed last Friday stated that the establishment of settlements\"has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\".\n\nThe US decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, who has taken diplomatic reprisals against the countries that voted in favour of the resolution.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli committee has postponed a vote to authorise construction of almost 500 new homes in Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nThe move apparently follows a request from Mr Netanyahu's office.\nTL;DR: US Secretary of State John Kerry has said the prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal based on a two-state solution is in grave jeopardy.\n\nArticle: The Kymin Round House in Monmouth attracts 65,000 people a year to a site Lord Horatio Nelson visited in 1802 and which has a naval monument.\n\nBut because of losses suffered because of the coronavirus pandemic, its reopening has been paused.\n\nIt will be the first time since 1902 it has not had a custodian on site.\n\nMartin Kerrigan, who has lived with his wife, Sara Szwer, at the site for 17 years, said:\"The proposal is to make us redundant which would mean we would have to move out of the house on the site.\"\n\nHe said he was concerned about the Kymin's long-term future, adding:\"It is a real local landmark and an icon for the town of Monmouth.\"\n\nVisitors follow in the footsteps of Lord Horatio Nelson, who dined in the Round House in 1802, while the Naval Temple was built in 1801 as a monument.\n\nThere are currently 13 weddings, some postponed because of coronavirus, booked for next year, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nMonmouth councillor Richard Roden said residents in the town were\"shocked\"at the possibility of custodians being removed.\n\n\"They play an essential role in keeping the property and area safe for the community and visitors to one of Monmouth's top visitor attractions,\"he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Trust said the charity faced losses of \u00a3200m as a result of coronavirus and had to review every aspect of its work and\"as a result we propose to make savings in almost every area of activity\".\n\nAt the Kymin, she said the current proposal was to\"pause reopening and rethink the visitor offer\", adding:\"This means it is unlikely to reopen in the immediate future.\"\nTL;DR: Wales' first National Trust site is set to close \"for the immediate future\", with its custodians losing their jobs and home.\n\nArticle: Nicholas WattNewsnight political editor@nicholaswatton Twitter\n\nBut the shadow chancellor admits that he has experienced a bruising few weeks. And that's not just because he sustained a bloody nose after tripping on rubbish outside his home.\n\nIn an interview with Newsnight, Mr McDonnell admits that the last week has been politically painful after centrist Labour MPs rebelled against his decision to accept Tory tax cuts in the budget.\n\n\"Oh yeah, oh no doubt about it,\"he told me when I said he had endured a painful time after last week's budget.\n\nMr McDonnell spoke of the internal Labour row during an interview in which he denied having fallen out with Jeremy Corbyn but acknowledged they complement each other with different personal qualities.\n\nThe shadow chancellor also spoke of how he had been seared by the 1992 general election when Labour failed to overcome Tory charges that it would increase taxes for middle income earners.\n\nBank manager or revolutionary Trot?\n\nMr McDonnell had a ready answer to a jibe coined by the veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge: that he is a Jekyll and Hyde character who veers between acting as a sensible bank manager and a revolutionary Trot.\n\nAsked which depiction was true:\"I am all of those things. I am a radical socialist. There is no doubt about that. That is my history. Everything I advocate is about transforming society, creating a more equal and more democratic and fairer society. \n\n\"I argue that it has got to be a prosperous society. But the difference between us and the Tories is that we want that prosperity shared by everybody. I call that socialism. At the same time I have been saying to people if we are going to win power, go into government, implement these policies, everything we do we have got to frame as common sense.\"\n\nHis role as the cautious bank manager, rather than a revolutionary Trot, explains his run-in last week with a group of twenty Labour MPs, led by Yvette Cooper, most of whom would normally be seen sitting to the right of his Socialist Campaign Group. \n\nThey took exception to Mr McDonnell's plan to accept Tory plans to bring forward a manifesto pledge to raise the personal tax allowance and the higher rate threshold on the grounds that this would benefit the top 20% of society.\n\nThe shadow chancellor refused to back down because he saw a trap in the budget. Had he rejected the tax cuts the Tories would have claimed Labour would increase taxes on middle income earners.\n\n\"When you see your opponent digging a hole in front of you, putting the spikes into that hole, covering them with leaves and inviting you to step into it, sometimes you want to walk round it.\"\n\nIt is Mr McDonnell's memory of the 1992 general election, when he failed to win his Hayed and Harlington seat by 53 votes, which explains his tactics. \n\nPerhaps surprisingly for the leading figure of the hard left in Parliament over the last 20 years, Mr McDonnell is focused strongly on not upsetting Middle England. Only the top 5% of earners on incomes over \u00a380,000 a year will be in his sights.\n\n\"The experience of'92 is seared into me,\"he told me in his constituency office, which is festooned with political banners and posters. \n\n\"This is a working class multicultural community. I have lived here nearly 40 years.\n\n\"In'92 I went round knocking on doors. If you remember the campaign the Tories waged with the big posters - Labour tax bombshell. I was knocking on doors of people who were unemployed, who were on low wages as well, saying to me'I can't vote for you because you will increase my taxes'. And we hadn't won the argument about a fair taxation system.\n\n\"So of course I am not going to make that mistake again. We are trying to persuade the Labour party we should never let them traduce our policies in that way. We have to be absolutely clear about our direction.\"\n\nCorbyn has'different virtues'\n\nMr McDonnell insists that he and Jeremy Corbyn have never had a political difference despite reports that the Labour leader had sympathised with the centrist Labour MPs on the Tory tax cuts. But he admits that they have different qualities.\n\nAsked whether they are different, with Mr McDonnell as the hard-headed strategist and Mr Corbyn as the dreamer, the shadow chancellor said:\"This idea that Jeremy is a dreamer is absolutely rubbish. Look at the work he has done on detailed policy. He had led on housing for years, well in advance of anyone else. He is a specialist in international affairs, always has been.\n\n\"Jeremy has got a steel about him that people out there will see increasingly. But you are right. We complement one another all the time. In some ways we have different virtues and different strengths and different weaknesses. And we work with each other in that way.\"\n\nMr McDonnell insists that Mr Corbyn is deadly serious about serving as prime minister even though he agreed to stand as the Socialist Campaign Group candidate in the 2015 Labour leadership contest with the words:\"Oh go on then I'll do it.\"\n\nThe shadow chancellor said:\"That is the sort of leader I want. I don't want someone who comes into Parliament with that back of an envelope: MP at such an age, minister at such an age, prime minister at such an age. I want someone who isn't motivated by career but by principle.\"\nTL;DR: John McDonnell is one of those confident political beasts who rarely acknowledge moments of vulnerability.\n\nArticle: \"Cinemas have got the brunt. We were the first to shut down and we will be the last to reopen,\"Alok Tandon, the CEO of multiplex chain Inox, told the BBC last month. Many of India's nearly 10,000 cinema halls closed in March, just as coronavirus cases had started to appear and even before the government imposed a lockdown. \n\nIndia continues to reopen, despite having the second-highest caseload in the world. \n\nOn Thursday, just as film theatres in several states welcomed customers, India's health ministry confirmed 680 deaths in the last 24 hours, its lowest in nearly three months. Daily averages of case numbers have also dipped in recent weeks, but experts say any slowdown must be greeted with caution.\n\nAfter a long summer with no movies on the big screen, opening up cinemas is largely a symbolic and\"feel-good move\", says Rakesh Jariwala, a media and entertainment analyst.\"The thinking is hopeful - like the idiom goes, build a city and people will come,\"he adds.\n\nBut watching a movie in a cinema won't be the same, at least in the foreseeable future. There will be no eager crowds or long queues at the ticket counter as social distancing is enforced. Names and phone numbers will be collected at the entrance for contact tracing. And no hall will run full as seating is capped at 50%. Even popcorn will be sterilised under UV rays for eight minutes, reported local media.\n\nBut the biggest blow is the lack of new material - for months, cinemas watched helplessly from the sidelines as streaming platforms snapped up Bollywood movies that were willing to opt for an online release. This leaves cinemas with no option but to re-release older titles, including those from 2018. \n\nThe problem, according to film critic Saibal Chatterjee, starts there.\"People aren't dying to go back and watch old films - why would we spend our money and take a risk? Who would go with their family and potentially expose them?\"\n\nBut studios remain reluctant to let go of new films just yet.\"It's a vicious circle - people won't come unless a big blockbuster releases, but producers won't release a big movie unless people come,\"Komal Nahta, a film and trade analyst, says.\n\nOn Thursday, movie theatres in India struggled to attract customers with many running shows for small audiences, reported the Associated Press. \n\nIndia's thriving south Indian film industry hasn't been spared either - releases of upcoming Tamil and Telugu films have been delayed after a halt in shooting.\n\nA similar parallel can be drawn overseas too, where a popular American movie chain recently announced that it would temporarily close hundreds of locations in the US and UK due to a lack of blockbusters to screen. \n\nAs of now, two big Bollywood extravaganzas have held out - Sooryavanshi, an action-packed police spectacle steered by superstar Akshay Kumar, is set to release in early 2021, while'83, a tribute to India's cricket World Cup victory in 1983, is due to have a Christmas showing. There are rumours that a sequel to a 2005 hit, Bunty Aur Babli, will release in mid-November, just in time for the Hindu festival of Diwali, often celebrated by both fireworks and a blockbuster. \n\nThe industry is banking on such releases to draw customers and ramp up sales. But it might not be enough to recoup their eye-watering losses - now pegged at around $1.2bn (\u00a3930m).\n\n\"It's going to be a very long-drawn process,\"adds Mr Nahta.\"In the short term, they're only staring at losses.\"\n\nBut first, cinemas have to rebuild confidence and dispel fears.\"This is a dry run - there are no new movies but it's a chance to lay the groundwork, enforce all the measures and hope that cinemas don't see cases,\"says Mr Chatterjee. \n\nMultiplex owners have said they will implement every precaution. But other public spaces that are back in action, such as restaurants or gyms, have seen low footfall. \n\nOwners are hoping that India's reputation as a movie-obsessed country, one which sold just over a billion tickets in 2019 and produces the most movies in the world, might help tide things over until new releases trickle in. And even though streaming is growing in popularity in India, experts say cinemas may do well in smaller cities and towns where streaming services are nascent and Covid-19 case numbers are fewer.\n\n\"Movie-going runs in the blood of this nation,\"Vikram Malhotra, CEO of Abundantia Entertainment, says.\"This is the classic Indian middle class activity - the day out with family.\"\n\nBut\"from a purely epidemiologist's perspective, this is the wrong time to open,\"says virologist Dr Jacob John. Cinemas are at greater risk than other public spaces of becoming breeding grounds for the virus.\"There's not much ventilation, the air is recycled by air conditioners and since it's dark, no-one will really check if everyone is wearing a mask,\"he adds.\n\nJust because the doors have reopened, doesn't mean they can't close again, with experts fearing that even a single case within cinema halls could prompt a shutdown.\"For the first time, the health of the film industry will not be governed by the content, but by the health of the public,\"says Mr Nahta.\nTL;DR: Cinemas have reopened in India after a seven month-long break forced by Covid-19. But with barely any new films being made and the pandemic still raging, lockdown losses will haunt its comeback, reports the BBC's Krutika Pathi.\n\nArticle: By Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter\n\nGetting Brexit done\n\nThe first and most obvious result of the general election is that Boris Johnson's promise to\"get Brexit done\"will become a reality on 31 January.\n\nWith a comfortable Conservative majority, Westminster deadlock over a withdrawal deal is a thing of the past - but that doesn't mean Brexit is going away as an issue.\n\nThere's still the small matter of agreeing a future relationship with the EU and laying the foundations for a trade deal - all inside an 11-month transition period.\n\nExpect the familiar talk of no-deal cliff edges to continue through much of the year - in debate at Holyrood as well as Westminster, with much of the Brexit legislation set to cut across devolved areas.\n\nThe Scottish government are digging in over Holyrood's consent for such bills, and will use every one of them to drive home a reminder of the 62% majority for Remain north of the border.\n\nHolyrood's budget\n\nNormally at this time of year, Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay would be locked in negotiations with opposition parties seeking support for his budget plans.\n\nThis year, there's something missing - the budget. Mr Mackay had planned to announce it on 12 December, but instead found himself in a polling booth.\n\nThe UK government is yet to set out its plans, and this means Mr Mackay doesn't know exactly how much money he has to spend. The knock-on effect is that councils and health boards don't know how much money they have to spend either.\n\nBy the time Chancellor Sajid Javid confirms the UK budget, on March 11, there will be very little time for debate, scrutiny or deal-making. The Treasury insists Mr Mackay will have enough information to set out his plans whenever he wants, but he says there has been\"absolutely no engagement\".\n\nHolyrood's budget process is meant to last months. The way things stand, it may have to be compressed into a matter of days.\n\nThe Salmond inquiries\n\nIn March, former first minister Alex Salmond will go on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. He denies charges of sexual misconduct by ten women.\n\nThe trial itself is entirely a matter for the justice system, not politics. But immediately after it ends, a series of inquiries will begin into how complaints against Mr Salmond were handled by the Scottish government.\n\nThe court is the only place where the substance of any complaints will be settled, but regardless of the outcome it will be far from the last word said about the matter.\n\nThe coming inquiries range from a government review of its botched internal investigation process - successfully challenged in court by Mr Salmond - a probe to establish whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code in her dealings with her predecessor, and a Holyrood inquiry into both.\n\nThe latter could potentially drag on for months, calling the first minister and her team of special advisors as witnesses in public committee hearings.\n\nElections\n\nIf you thought the big questions of leadership were settled on 12 December, think again. Many political party members are going to find themselves voting again in short order - for new leaders.\n\nThe Scottish Conservative leadership contest - left in deep freeze during the election campaign - has now begun in earnest.\n\nAlongside the UK Labour leadership race, Scottish Labour have to find themselves a new deputy leader after Lesley Laird lost the position along with her seat on December 12.\n\nThe Lib Dems meanwhile also need a new figurehead after the SNP dethroned Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire.\n\nIn Scotland, there's another national election coming around the corner too, in the shape of the 2021 Holyrood contest. Expect the various leadership pitches to play a big part in setting the scene for that race.\n\nGender Recognition reforms\n\nGovernments don't often save up big reforms for the tail end of the parliamentary term, but Ms Sturgeon and her ministers still have one contentious domestic topic to wrestle with.\n\nThe government wants to reform the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender, saying the current system can be\"traumatic and demeaning\".\n\nHowever, the plan has come in for criticism from some SNP backbenchers, and the idea of allowing people to\"self-identify\"their gender has been the topic of fierce debate.\n\nMinisters have put their plans out for a fresh consultation, saying there needs to be\"maximum consensus\"due to\"valid concerns\"- but remain committed to making changes.\n\nThe consultation is due back in March, and the government would have to move relatively swiftly after that to get legislation through parliament before the next election.\n\nIndyref2\n\nThe Conservative majority at Westminster has largely settled the issue of Brexit. But with the SNP winning a landslide north of the border, the other constitutional battleground - independence - is very much alive.\n\nNicola Sturgeon wants to hold a new referendum within the year, and has formally requested powers from Westminster to do so.\n\nBut will it happen in 2020?\n\nThere are two elements to this question. The first is the logistics of actually holding a ballot, with PM Boris Johnson so far refusing to agree the deal Ms Sturgeon wants.\n\nFingers in ears at Downing Street won't help the SNP get a referendum in 2020, but it might help with the second element - winning a referendum.\n\nHere, uncertainty remains Ms Sturgeon's biggest problem.\n\nEven with the fog of Brexit befuddlement clearing, there are still question marks over how it will impact on the public mood. Ms Sturgeon will be hoping it could provide the boost needed to get the Yes camp over the line, but is she willing to gamble on it now, with the polls finely poised?\nTL;DR: MSPs are heading back to work at Holyrood while newly-elected MPs gear up to pass a Brexit deal at Westminster. After a tumultuous 2019, what does 2020 hold in store for Scottish politics? \n\n\n\nArticle: Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter\n\nBut it is an active member of the Nato alliance, and its dark history at the hands of Russia gives it good reason to cosy up to Washington. Poland is hosting one of the US anti-ballistic missile sites in Europe. \n\nIndeed some Poles are eager to see a large fully-fledged US military base - what some have dubbed\"Fort Trump\"- on their soil. So co-hosting this would-be US diplomatic extravaganza makes clear sense to them.\n\nBut one is left with the nagging thought that this meeting is in Poland primarily for one reason - none of Washington's other close partners in Europe were terribly eager to host it. \n\nThe gathering has prompted a collective yawn in European diplomatic circles. Even at this late stage it is uncertain who exactly will turn up and at what level many countries will be represented. \n\nThe genesis of this gathering was a proposal by the Americans to have an international meeting to increase the pressure on Tehran. But this idea was quickly revised since there was little enthusiasm among some of Washington's Western European allies. \n\nIndeed it became clear that putting the spotlight solely on Iran might simply highlight the divisions in the Western camp in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement - the JCPOA - with Tehran.\n\nSo instead the agenda has been broadened with the meeting now billed as a ministerial aimed at\"Promoting a Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East\". \n\nIran is not named on the agenda which includes broad thematic issues like humanitarian and refugee challenges, missile proliferation and 21st Century threats like cyber and terrorism. \n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not be on the agenda - the Palestinians are not attending since they are boycotting the Trump administration.\n\nSo who will go and at what level will they be represented?\n\nWe may not know that until ministers and officials actually turn up. \n\nThe Americans will be represented by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but Vice-President Mike Pence and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, (architect of the administration's yet to be revealed Middle East peace plan) will also probably attend. \n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will be there - at least for the opening session. \n\nOther major European players may be represented at a lower level. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is heading to Warsaw - according to Polish sources - and several Arab governments will send delegations headed by ministers, including Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Egypt and Tunisia are expected to send deputy-ministers. \n\nIndeed this could be the first major diplomatic gathering where Israel and the moderate Arab States have sat down to discuss regional security since the Madrid talks during the early 1990s. Some aspects of the peace process will inevitably come up but Iran is still likely to be a major area of discussion.\n\nThere is a fundamental division amongst the participants here. The US, Israel and many of the moderate Arab States see Iran as a malevolent influence in the region, seeking to expand its role at every opportunity. They were sceptical about the 2015 nuclear deal that was intended to constrain Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nIsrael in particular stands with the US and the Saudis here.\n\nIt is confronting a growing Iranian military presence in Syria and Lebanon. It is actively engaged in a battle of attrition against Iranian forces and proxy militias in the region. \n\nMr Netanyahu is likely to argue that Iran should not be looked at through the prism of divisions between the US and Europe over the nuclear deal. \n\nInstead he will argue that it is European values that are at stake. Iran's behaviour - its support for terrorism; its human rights abuses, the detention of foreign nationals - are all issues that should matter to European governments.\n\nIt is certainly true that foreign ministries in London, Paris and Germany are concerned about Iran's regional behaviour and its developing missile programmes. But there is uncertainty about quite what to do about them. \n\nFor the Europeans, maintaining what they see as the nuclear deal's brakes on Iran's nuclear activities is the paramount concern. For Washington, Israel and the moderate Arabs this is insufficient. \n\nBut Europe is distracted by Brexit and a host of other issues. Persistent tensions with the Trump administration and the US president's erratic policy decisions - the move to pull US forces out of Syria and the threatened draw-down in Afghanistan for example  - only make matters worse. \n\nThe US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and more recently, the INF disarmament treaty, only flags up the perceived unreliability of Washington in many European eyes. \n\nSo whatever the multiple problems in the Middle East, this gathering may tell us just as much about the divisions in the Western camp which seem to be getting worse rather than better.\nTL;DR: The US decision to host a Middle East conference in Warsaw looks set to be a curious diplomatic occasion. But why is this gathering of mainly Western and Arab governments being held in the Polish capital? Poland, which is co-hosting the conference, is not known for its deep involvement in the Middle East's myriad problems.\n\nArticle: Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles ordered the authority to implement whole-council elections by 2017.\n\nThe move was one of the recommendations made in a report by Sir Bob Kerslake, published last month.\n\nCouncil leader Sir Albert Bore said preliminary work was\"already well under way\".\n\nIn his report, Sir Bob concluded the council's current election system, where a third of councillors are voted in each year, had not helped\"strategic decisions\".\n\nUnder the new set-up, the entire council would be up for re-election every four years.\n\nMr Pickles also announced the appointment of an independent improvement panel, another measure recommended in the Kerslake review.\n\nIt will be headed by John Crabtree OBE, former president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMr Pickles said the\"serious\"problems found by Sir Bob prevented Birmingham from fulfilling its potential.\n\n\"It is essential now that the city council makes rapid progress if it is to serve the people and businesses of Birmingham as it should,\"he said.\n\nFormer Youth Justice Board chief Frances Done, Leeds City Council leader Keith Wakefield, and Cheshire West and Chester Council chief executive Steve Robinson will also sit on the panel.\n\nSir Albert said he welcomed the appointments.\nTL;DR: Birmingham City Council has been ordered to overhaul its election system in a bid to tackle \"deep-rooted\" issues.\n\nArticle: By Clodagh RiceBBC News NI Business Correspondent\n\nMany well-known venues have been forced to close their doors due to lockdown.\n\nNow a number of firms, including Eddie Irvine Sports, Movie House cinemas, Drumbo Park, We Are Vertigo and Odyssey Bowl, have launched an industry forum.\n\nThey have called on the government to extend support to their sector.\n\nThe group, called the Entertainment and Leisure Forum, has written to the economy and finance ministers to seek support for the sector, which it says employs 10,000 people and contributes \u00a3100m to the economy each year.\n\nThe letter recognises the job retention scheme and three month rates holiday are helping with cash flow, but says rent, bank repayments, insurance, utility and other costs are\"rapidly eroding cash reserves and placing the future of many members at risk\".\n\nIt is likely that  entertainment venues will be the last to open, once lockdown restrictions are eased.\n\nAt the Stormont briefing on Tuesday, the deaths of another 20 people with coronavirus were announced in Northern Ireland.\n\nThat brings the total number of deaths to 329, although this figure, which relates mainly to hospital fatalities, is likely to rise.\n\nChief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said it was not yet time to relax social distancing and measures to ensure\"we break the cycle and chain of infections\".\n\nSmall business grant support is available to firms with a rateable value of between \u00a315,000-\u00a351,000, but this forum says the majority of its members exceed that criteria.\n\nThe letter reads:\"This makes no practical or economic sense because our members are under exactly the same business pressures as small firms, but the sums involved are larger. \n\n\"The consequences for employment are also larger if they fail.\"\n\n'Fluid situation'\n\nIn a statement, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said:\"I do understand that some businesses, employers and individuals will not be able to avail of this grant scheme. \n\n\"The \u00a340m Hardship Fund was recently announced in order to support those who have been unable to avail of assistance on offer thus far. \n\n\"This is still a very fluid situation and I would ask that all stakeholders continue to monitor the NI Business Info website where information on support options is updated continuously.\"\n\nThe forum would also like to see the three-month rates holiday extended to 12 months, in line with the rest of the UK.\n\n'Targeted relief'\n\nIn response, a Department of Finance spokesperson said:\"The 12-month rates holiday in Britain only applies to retail, hospitality and leisure businesses. \n\n\"In contrast the three-month rates holiday here applies to all businesses. If the English scheme had been adopted, 60% of properties here would be paying rates this month.\n\n\"As part of the next stage, the minister recently announced that the department is working in

It says its divers will use a sonar device that can reach a depth of 150m (500ft) and scan within 130m to identify objects.\n\nMr Deri, who is also an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, discussed the plan with Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter. \n\nIn 2005 Hungary unveiled a memorial by the river, called The Shoes on the Danube Promenade. Sixty pairs of old-fashioned shoes made of cast iron line the Pest embankment, in memory of the murdered Jews.\n\nIsrael's Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem describes how the Nazi-backed Hungarian fascists slaughtered Jewish men, women and children, often tying victims' hands with shoelaces.

Well-known for his anti-corruption campaigning, he has recently stepped-up his political activity after announcing plans to run for president next year. \n\nBut he reacted to the Strasbourg ruling from another Russian courtroom.\n\nThe activist is currently being re-tried in Kirov for embezzlement from a state-run timber company, Kirovles. He received a five-year suspended sentence after an earlier trial in 2013, but the verdict was later quashed by Russia's Supreme Court. It sent the case sent for retrial after the ECHR ruled the original verdict unsound.\n\nMr Navalny argues that the Kirovles case is fabricated in order to keep him out of politics. He has described the rerun of the trial as an\"exact copy\"of the original proceedings, and says he is sure he will be found guilty once again. A criminal conviction would bar him from running for president.\n\nThe activist planned to open an election HQ in Russia's second city of St Petersburg this weekend. However, the judge hearing the Kirovles case has now banned him from leaving town until 10 February.\n\nIn November Mr Navalny received a payout from the justice ministry worth about 53,000 euros in compliance with the ECHR ruling on the previous Kirovles trial.\n\nHe published a bank statement to show the money had appeared in his account. He joked that he got the compensation the day after he had said he would not go to Kirov for the new trial because he had not got enough money to cover expenses.\nTL;DR: The European Court of Human Rights has ordered Russia to pay more than 63,000 euros (\u00a354,000) in compensation to opposition politician Alexei Navalny.\n\nArticle: By Rebecca Cafe & Alpa PatelBBC News\n\nIn 2013-14, 2,873 teenagers sought treatment whereas in 2017-18 it was 4,743, data from NHS Digital shows.\n\nAllergy UK said this could be because this was the age when sufferers started taking responsibility for themselves.\n\nThere have been calls for the government to introduce legislation on how schools should manage allergies.\n\nThe figures from NHS Digital, released to BBC London under the Freedom of Information Act, also showed the number of children treated for anaphylactic shock increased by 41% in the past five years.\n\nFor teenagers, the increase was 36% while for those aged 19 and over, it increased by 10%.\n\nAmena Warner, head of clinical services for Allergy UK, said one reason why more teenagers were receiving treatment was because at that age, allergy sufferers started to move away from parental control. \n\nShe said teenagers might not question food the same way as parents did and may not read food labels in detail, while sufferers might also be more inclined to seek hospital treatment because they had more awareness about what happened during a reaction.\n\nDr Paul Turner, a consultant in Paediatric Allergy and Immunology at Imperial College London, said risk-taking or a lack of self-confidence in managing food allergies was\"almost certainly a factor in the increase in non-fatal anaphylaxis in this age group\".\n\nFood allergies affect about 7% of children in the UK, according to Kings College London.\n\nSchoolboy Karanbir Cheema died in 2017 after he had a severe reaction to cheese that was thrown at him while he was at school.\n\nFollowing an inquest, the coroner said it was\"vital\"allergy action plans were standardised in hospitals and schools.\n\nHowever, allergy specialist Prof Adam Fox said he was seeing a lot of occasions when schools seemed to be failing families. \n\n\"In the most extreme cases, parents seem to be genuinely frightened to send them to a school where they don't feel safe,\"said Prof Fox, a paediatric allergist at Evelina London children's hospital.\n\nA parent's view:'They don't get it'\n\nJenna Laing-Phillips, whose 10-year-old son Stanley has severe allergies, said it could be\"overwhelming because you spend every day thinking about minimising risks\".\n\n\"Food is the easy bit in a way, but then you do have to think about the surfaces he's touching, the handles he might be touching. These are the issues we had at school, they don't get it... the risk of cross contamination is huge.\"\n\nShe took Stanley out of his old school in Surrey, saying she believed it did not have proper safeguards in place to protect him, but the school denied the claim and said safeguarding was its\"top priority\".\n\nIt also said there were no recorded incidents of an allergic reaction by Stanley while he was in the care of the school.\n\n\"What we want to know is that our kids are safe in school and that they've done everything they can to minimise the risk and if something was to happen, the school will know what to do because actually they have clear legislation to follow,\"Ms Laing-Phillips said.\n\nShe launched a petition calling for the introduction of statutory allergy legislation.\n\nIn its response, the government said it considered the\"existing legislation combined with statutory guidance to be sufficient\". \n\nAll primary and secondary schools in the UK are able to buy adrenaline auto-injectors without a prescription for use in emergencies but some have called for more guidance from the government.\n\nAt Crowthorne Church of England Primary School in Berkshire, lunch boxes are checked by staff while photos and care plans have been put in place for every child with a food allergy. Every member of staff has also been trained to use an EpiPen.\n\nBut head teacher Ruth Jackson said better guidance from the government would be reassuring.\n\n\"It would be good for head teachers to know what good practice is and to make sure that they are following it because ultimately what every head teacher wants is to make sure they're doing the best for every child,\"she said.\n\nThe Department for Education said it was\"clear that children with medical conditions should be properly supported to enjoy a full education and be safe at school\".\n\n\"All schools are required to make arrangements that ensure this is the case,\"a spokesperson said.\nTL;DR: The number of children who received hospital treatment for allergies has increased by 65% across England in the past five years, figures have revealed.\n\nArticle: By Rana JawadBBC News, Tripoli\n\nThe National Forces Alliance (NFA), led by ex-interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, gained more than double the seats of its Islamist rivals.\n\nSo should its MPs be described as secularist liberals or moderate modernists?\n\nThe reality is that those in the alliance are largely unknown, expect for Mr Jibril - whose face was one everyone recognised when they went to the polls.\n\nWhen it comes to their politics, Libyans certainly believe that the NFA is\"liberal\", but the word\"secular\"is not used.\n\nMr Jibril himself has already declared that his party shall refer to Sharia for guidance in legislation. \n\nSo do these final preliminary results, pending a two-week window for any legal appeal, mean the conservative North African country is less religious than neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt, where Islamists did well in recent post-revolutionary elections?\n\nNot really.\n\n'Tired of preachers'\n\nLibyans do not need politicians to tell them how to be good Muslims, says 18-year-old Heba, a tall, model-thin girl who presents an Arabic music programme on radio.\n\nThey want the parliament to deal with more pressing concerns, she explains.\n\n\"It's not like we expect nightclubs and things like that to suddenly open their doors here,\"she says.\n\n\"We have things to take care of like education and health.\"\n\nThe number of people who found the mere existence of religious parties an offensive concept was astonishing.\n\n\"We're all Muslims here! Who do they think they are preaching to us? They're not more religious than us\"were common reactions heard in cities.\n\nLibyans are ultimately tired of ideological preachers - they endured it for more than 40 years with Col Gaddafi's eccentric and confusing semi-Islamic, socialist ramblings. \n\nAnd parties like the Muslim Brotherhood are seen as having hijacked Tunisia and Egypt's revolutions.\n\nBut it is not clear whether the centrist NFA will dominate the 200-member National Assembly because 120 seats are reserved for independents whose allegiances are not yet known.\n\nIn the end a grand coalition could be formed, which may or may not include the biggest loser in this recent election - The Nation Party led by former al-Qaeda-linked Abdelhakim Belhaj - which gained no seats at all on the party-list.\n\n'Aspirin needed'\n\nAnd for the first time women are now about to take up an active, public role in Libyan politics, with 33 gaining seats in the assembly.\n\nBut finding consensus on the conflicting regional

well-being.\n\n\"There have been times where electrical wiring has been a problem and we've had to take action with the landlord to try to bring about improvements.\"\n\nClive Maides, chairman of the Guernsey Private Residential Landlords Association, said if any legislation were to be brought in there needed to be\"a common sense approach\".\n\nHe said:\"It needs to be equitable and should not only protect the tenant but the landlord, who don't generally want to be banded as bad individuals.\n\n\"It could mean unnecessary expense for landlords, which will no doubt reflect in rents or may even put landlords off investing in property to let out.\"\n\nMrs Cameron said:\"If we can secure compliance without statutory intervention then that's the best way forward.\n\n\"We do need some statutory powers behind all of that because we do come across certain conditions where the owners, landlords or agents are very reluctant to carry out these improvements.\n\n\"You can't compare those

This allows officers to deal with violent or potentially violent people at a distance.\n\nThey were introduced in the UK in 2003 for firearms officers. In 2007 they were extended to non-firearms officers known as Specially Trained Officers (STO).\n\nIn England and Wales, there are currently around 17,000 Taser-trained police out of 123,000 officers. \n\nSeveral police forces, including South Wales Police, have doubled the amount of officers who are Taser trained in recent years but say they will not train all staff.\n\nAccording to Home Office figures, they were used in 17,100 incidents in the year to March 2018, up from 11,300 the year before. \n\nIf an officer draws, aims and places a Taser red dot on the suspect, without harming them, the weapon is classed as\"used\"but not discharged. In 85% of the cases they were not discharged.\n\nTasers are an illegal weapon in the UK and members of the public who are found in possession of a Taser face up to 10 years in prison.\n\nTo be issued with a Taser, police officers must have completed 18 hours of training and are then required to undergo a compulsory refresher course every year.\n\nWhat is the case for more officers using Tasers?\n\nA recent Police Federation of England and Wales survey found 94% of officers think Tasers should be issued to more frontline staff.\n\nMeanwhile, a petition demanding all police officers in the UK are issued with Tasers has garnered more than 95,000 signatures. \n\nJohn Apter, national chair of the Police Federation, believes the Home Office should pay for all frontline officers to undergo the training - not the heads of each individual force.\n\nThe Independent reported that he asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to provide funding for frontline officers working across the country to undergo training.\n\nHe told the BBC:\"Officers are telling me daily they are feeling vulnerable and often isolated due to the lack of this vital protective equipment. \n\n\"Ultimately, having a Taser gives them the capability to defend not only themselves but also the public they want to protect.\n\n\"This call for a wider rollout is not new; the federation has been fighting for many years for Tasers to be available to all colleagues who want to carry it and who pass the assessment.\"\n\nWhy are Tasers controversial?\n\nBut Taser use remains controversial since they were first introduced by forces in 2003.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, 18 people in the UK have died after a Taser was discharged against them by police since Tasers were introduced 16 years ago.\n\nAn IPCC report tracked several of the subsequent inquests - none of which recorded Taser use as the cause of death. However, the report only covered cases up to 2012.\n\nIn 2015, a jury at the inquest of Jordan Begley, 23, delivered a narrative verdict concluding he died partly as a result of being\"inappropriately and unreasonably\"Tasered and restrained by Greater Manchester Police officers two years earlier.\n\nThe death of ex-footballer Dalian Atkinson in 2016, after he was shot with a Taser, sparked virulent debate about the use of the stun gun by police. However, an inquest is yet to take place and while the CPS continues to consider bringing criminal charges against officers, it remains unclear whether the Taser contributed to Atkinson's death.\n\nA study by Cambridge University found that police officers visibly armed with Tasers used force 48% more often, and were more likely to be assaulted than those on unarmed shifts.\n\nAn experiment with City of London police found that, while rarely deployed, just the presence of Tasers lead to greater overall hostility in interactions between the police and public.\n\nAmnesty says the public should\"resist the drum-beat of calls for all police to carry a Taser.\"\n\nOliver Feeley-Sprague, Amnesty UK's police and security programme director, says:\"We recognise that Tasers can play a part in modern policing and have been proven to be effective as a distance control weapon in response to threats of serious harm. However, using them is not risk-free.\n\n\"A large number of officers fail the Taser training course, either in the proficiency of using it or their judgement about when to use it. This demonstrates very clearly that a Taser is not suitable for every officer.\"\n\nAdditionally, black people are three times more likely than white people to be involved in Taser incidents, Home Office figures disclosed to the BBC in 2015 suggest.\n\nNumbers show Tasers were drawn, aimed or fired 38,000 times in England and Wales from 2010 to 2015. \n\nBut in more than 12% of those cases the Tasers were used against black people, who make up about 4% of the population.\n\nWhat does the Home Office say?\n\nA Home Office spokesman told the BBC:\"We are working to ensure forces have the resources, tools and powers they need to keep people safe. \n\n\"Tasers are an important tactical option for officers facing violent situations, and it is for chief officers to determine the number of devices and specially trained officers they need.\"\n\nClarification: This article was updated on 28 August 2019 to add in details of inquest findings.\nTL;DR: If you're a police officer, your chance of being equipped with a Taser depends on your force.\n\nArticle: Officers in Oregon city, Ohio, praised the caller's quick thinking, which led to the alleged abuser being arrested.\n\nThe unnamed woman told local media her mum was being attacked at the time.\n\nThis tactic for subtly calling the emergency services has been internet lore for years, but this is a rare confirmed case of it being effective.\n\nOfficials have previously warned that the strategy is not guaranteed to work, as dispatchers are not trained to recognise a pizza order as a genuine call for help.\n\nThe dispatcher who answered the call, Tim Teneyck, told local news station 13 ABC he initially thought the woman had dialled an incorrect number.\n\nWhen she insisted she was through to the right person, he realised what was happening - partly because he had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media.\n\n\"You see it on Facebook, but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for,\"Mr Teneyck said.\"Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this.\"\n\nWhat did the caller say?\n\nHere's a transcript of the conversation.\n\nMr Teneyck: Oregon 911\n\nCaller: I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted].\n\nMr Teneyck: You called 911 to order a pizza?\n\nCaller: Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted].\n\nMr Teneyck: This is the wrong number to call for a pizza...\n\nCaller: No, no, no. You're not understanding.\n\nMr Teneyck: I'm getting you now.\n\nLater in the call, the woman found creative ways to answer Mr Teneyck's yes or no questions about how much danger she and her mother were in, and what services they needed.\n\nMr Teneyck: Is the other guy still there?\n\nCaller: Yep, I need a large pizza.\n\nMr Teneyck: All right. How about medical, do you need medical?\n\nCaller: No. With pepperoni.\n\nWhere does the pizza idea come from?\n\nIt is unclear where exactly the idea originated, but a very similar scenario was used in a campaign by the Norwegian Women's Shelter Association in 2010. \n\nFour years later, in May 2014, a user on discussion website Reddit claiming to be a 911 operator described a domestic abuse victim calling to order a pizza. They wrote that the call\"started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious\"- before describing a conversation similar to the one Mr Tenyck had.\n\nA few months later a number of news sites reported on the Reddit post, and in 2015 it was even turned into a Super Bowl ad addressing domestic abuse.\n\nThe scenario later became a viral\"public service announcement\"on social media, with one Facebook post making the unsubstantiated claim that\"dispatchers are trained\"to recognise the pizza call as a call for help, and to ask specific questions.\n\nThis claim was debunked last year. Christopher Carver, the dispatch centre operations director for the National Emergency Number Association in the US, told the Associated Press that police are not trained to listen out for any specific code words or scenarios.\n\n\"Setting any expectations of secret phrases that will work with any 911 centre is potentially very dangerous,\"he said, and recommended that people use 911's SMS service instead. \n\nBut the\"Text to 911\"service is not available in all US locations, and is not functioning in Oregon city in Ohio.\n\nMr Carver did say that dispatchers would not hang up on a caller. The priority, he added, is for callers to let the dispatcher know their location.\n\nWhat can people in the UK do?\n\nPeople who need to make a discreet call to 999 - the UK's emergency services number - can do so using the British police's\"silent solution\"system.\n\nA 999 caller who is unable to speak can key in the number 55 to silently inform officers that they are experiencing a genuine emergency.\nTL;DR: A woman in a domestic violence situation managed to call 911 without the perpetrator realising, by pretending to order a pizza.\n\nArticle: By Tom GeogheganBBC News, Washington \n\n1. It's all about the Senate\n\nIt is very unlikely that the House of Representatives, the lower house which has a Republican majority, will be won by the Democrats.\"With a few historical exceptions the party in the White House loses support during mid-terms,\"says Shaun Bowler, political scientist at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nThe party of the president has only gained ground in three out of 38 mid-term elections and with President Barack Obama's approval ratings pretty low, there's nothing to suggest this election will buck the trend.\n\nSo all the attention is on the Senate, where Republicans need to win just six seats to gain control. This would mean the president would have lost control of both houses since he came to office - handing the Republicans more legislative powers, but retaining his power of veto over bills.\n\nWhat difference would a Republican Senate make?\n\nWhy US mid-term elections matter\n\n2. Only the hardcore vote\n\nTurnout is generally much lower in mid-terms and it's usually the committed voters that make it to the polling booth.\n\nThis time, turnout will be lower than 2006 and 2010 when the Iraq War and the president's healthcare overhaul were galvanising issues, says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief at Gallup. There's no such clarion call this time, and it's a split Congress, which makes it harder for voters to know who to blame.\n\n\"In 2010 they could get mad at the Democrats because they controlled both Senate and House. It's a more confusing situation now.\"\n\nA lower turnout would favour Republicans, who are always more likely to vote in mid-terms than Democrats. Republicans tend to be older and better educated, says Newport, while Democrats are more loosely attached to the system, with a lower registration rate. \n\n\"So everything else being equal, Republicans will have a turnout advantage.\"\n\n3. There's no stand-out issue this time - except Obama\n\nMid-term elections are nearly always referenda on the incumbent president and this one is certainly no exception, says elections analyst Charlie Cook. And very few Democrats in competitive races are willing to appear with him or, in one case, even admit that she voted for him.\n\n\"To the extent that Americans vote on other things, it is the economy, and people don't feel that great about it,\"he says. \n\n\"It's growing, but in low gear. Real median family incomes haven't gone up since 2000, and Americans for the first time in history doubt that their children and grandchildren will have the same opportunities that they had.\"\n\nLatino voters are disillusioned that Obama has not been able to do more on immigration, and many voters put the dysfunction of government high on the list. \n\nOnly 14% of voters approve of the job Congress is doing. Many want to fix how the government operates. But paradoxically, 90% of incumbents get re-elected, so while people hate the institution they are usually happy with the individuals who represent them. \n\nLocal factors always play a part in mid-terms too, so abortion restrictions have dominated the race in Colorado and in Louisiana, coastal erosion is an issue. But Republicans nationally want to make it all about the president.\n\n4. It could help shape the big race in 2016\n\nIt's a different electorate in a mid-term election from a presidential one, but there are ways 2014 could influence 2016.\n\nIf the Republicans have a feel-good win in a week's time, then the presidential nomination process in their party could become more complicated and divisive, says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball. That's because there will be much more incentive to run and the prize of being the Republican candidate will feel more valuable.\n\n\"And if Obama's approval numbers look like they do today or worst it will feel like a drag on Democratic candidates.\"\n\nThe working of a familiar electoral cycle - a backlash against the White House - could be over-interpreted as a repudiation of the president, says Bowler. But it will be interesting to see how the Republicans do in winning over non-white voters, because they will be key to their 2016 prospects.\n\n5. The family connections\n\nThere's nothing new about dynasties in American politics - you only have to think of the families Adams (two presidents), Roosevelt (two presidents), Kennedy (one president, two more senators) and Bush (two presidents, one governor). Dynasties bring with them personal wealth and name identification. But in these 2014 elections, the phenomenon is all the more prevalent.\n\nThe grandson of former president George HW Bush, George P Bush, is running for land commissioner in Texas. And in Georgia, Jason Carter, the grandson of former president Jimmy Carter is running for governor. Other names have glittering political pedigrees in certain states - Udall in Colorado, Landrieu in Louisiana and Pryor in Arkansas. \n\nThen you have Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush standing by to possibly run in 2016.\n\n\"Ideally, American politics isn't meant to work this way,\"says Kondik.\"Our country was founded on the idea that we weren't to have an aristocracy. But dynasties are a big deal in American politics. We might not like it but it's inescapable.\"\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: The mid-term elections in the US are one week away.

He says all lorries are checked at quiet times, but it becomes a\"lottery\"when the port is busy because staff cannot process vehicles fast enough.\n\nLorries then have documents checked by UK border staff and must also pass a customs checkpoint before driving on to a ferry.\n\nThe port also has roving patrols of security guards with dogs and carbon dioxide detectors - which can detect raised levels caused by people breathing in the lorries.\n\nHow strong is security at Calais port?\n\nThe port is protected by 16ft (5m) fences topped with coils of razor wire and CCTV, with the gates and exterior guarded by heavily armed French riot police.\n\nInside, there is a\"comprehensive network of surveillance cameras\", according to the port's website, and security guards patrol with dogs.\n\nIn 2014, Britain committed \u00a312m over three years to tackle the problems at Calais, and part of this is being used to build a 15ft fence along the motorway leading to the port.\n\nAs well as the three-year Calais investment, the UK announced \u00a32m extra for detection technology such as the heartbeat and carbon dioxide detectors, and \u00a31m for more dog searches.\n\nIn August 2015, the UK and France a fresh agreement on new measures in Calais, including a\"control and command centre\"and the deployment of 500 extra British and French police. The UK agreed to pay \u00a37m over two years towards the new measures, in addition to money previously pledged.\n\nIn January 2016 scores of migrants managed to storm a P&O ferry in the port after breaking away from a demonstration in the town.\n\nFollowing the incident, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said extra forces, including riot police, gendarmes and border units, had been mobilised for several months. \n\nWhat are French police doing?\n\nFrench police have been widely criticised for taking migrants off lorries, driving them a few miles away then releasing them - free to walk back to Calais.\n\nBut many undocumented migrants are arrested - reportedly more than 18,000 in the first half of 2015. \n\nThe problem, police say, is that there are simply too many to arrest and deal with.\n\nThey also say their focus on the motorway is safety, so getting people off the road is the priority.\n\nThe French authorities are also struggling to stop illegal migrants crossing into France from Italy, where tens of thousands of people are thought to have arrived by boat from Africa.\n\nWhat happens on arrival in the UK?\n\nPassengers arriving at Dover from Calais - by far the busiest ferry route between Britain and France - have already passed UK border controls under the juxtaposed borders system.\n\nHowever, border staff carry out random checks on vehicles before they leave the port. \n\nMr Fleming said all lorries have to drive through an X-ray scanner which checks for stowaways.\n\nWhat does the UK government want?\n\nMr Cameron has warned against either the UK or France\"trying to point the finger of blame\", saying the two countries must continue to co-operate.\n\nMr Cameron said the migration problem must be tackled\"at source\"by stopping trafficking operations across the Mediterranean, and by making Britain a\"less easy place\"for illegal migrants to work.\n\nBut Damian Collins, Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, has said French authorities allow migrants to cross France\"in the hope that they illegally gain entry to the UK\".\n\nMr Hanson, a Labour MP, said there must be a\"joint agreement\"on what happens to migrants at Calais - so they are either accepted as asylum seekers, detained or deported from France.\n\nWhat do French authorities say?\n\nThe French government says it is speeding up the processing of asylum applications and looking to deport those who have no right to be in France.\n\nHome Secretary Theresa May told the House of Commons in 2015 that French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was\"as grateful as I was for the strong co-operation\"between the two countries during problems at Calais.\n\nBut Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart has said the town is a\"hostage to the British\"because migrants expect better lives in the UK.\n\nShe called the situation\"barely manageable\"and called for the UK border to be moved back to Britain.\n\nHow strong is security at the Channel Tunnel?\n\nCCTV and electrified fences protect the tracks and tunnel entrance at Coquelles near Calais - though striking ferry workers got on to the track and started a fire in June 2015.\n\nIt was also announced by the British government that the National Barrier Asset - a 9ft police barrier - had been deployed to the lorry terminal at Coquelles. The barrier was still there in March 2016.\n\nAs with ferries from Calais, the UK and France operate juxtaposed controls on Channel Tunnel trains - so passengers must pass UK border checks before travelling.\n\nUK border staff can also travel on trains to carry out extra checks. \n\nWhat happens if the UK leaves the EU?\n\nSecurity in Calais has become an argument between opposing campaigns ahead of the UK's referendum on EU membership, which will be held on 23 June.\n\nFrench economy minister Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times the country could end the so-called Le Touquet agreement - which lets UK border guards check passports on the French side of the border - if Britain left the EU.\n\nHowever, Leave campaigners dismissed the comments as\"scaremongering\".\n\nIt comes after another row, which followed comments from Mr Cameron that migrant camps like the\"Jungle\"in Calais could move to England if the UK left the EU.\n\nUKIP said the PM's claim was\"based on fear, negativity and falsehood\". French government said it had\"no plans\"to change the agreement.\nTL;DR: Thousands of migrants determined to reach the UK live in camps near the port of Calais.\n\nArticle: The council began a 12-month trial of monthly collections in September, to encourage residents to recycle more. \n\nCouncillor Bill Darwin, who represents Kinmel Bay, said the new arrangement was a\"potential health time-bomb\".\n\nConwy council said it is half way through the trial period and there is no evidence of an increase in vermin.\n\nMr Darwin said there had been an increase in fly-tipping in the Towyn and Kinmel Bay areas as people struggle to fit four weeks' worth of waste into one wheelie bin.\n\n\"It's not too bad if there's just one couple living in a house but it's a big problem for families,\"he said.\n\n\"People are resorting to taking household rubbish, including dog excrement and cat litter, to public litter bins and this is causing an increase in rats and seagulls.\n\n\"The smell is terrible and it's only going to get worse as the warmer weather comes.\"\n\nMore than 10,000 Conwy residents are taking part in the trial, while the council has brought in three-weekly bin collections for the rest of the county. \n\nClwyd West AM Darren Millar said complaints had\"increased dramatically\"since it had started. \n\n\"The situation is totally unacceptable and unless these changes are scrapped, it will have a detrimental impact on our tourism industry and local wildlife,\"he said. \n\nThe council's recycling and waste policy states that properties with fewer than six residents are restricted to one wheelie bin for household waste and that overflowing or open bins will not be collected. \n\nThere are weekly collections for recycling and food waste. \n\n'Overflowing' \n\nMr Darwin is asking for more feedback from local residents as he writes a report to present to the council.\n\nA council spokeswoman said there was\"no evidence of an increase in vermin\"and that\"the vast majority of residents are disposing of their food waste correctly in their food waste bin\". \n\nShe added the four-weekly trial was introduced after the council found half of rubbish thrown away to landfill could have been recycled, wasting \u00a31.6m each year.\n\nSince September, the trial has seen residents throw 507 tonnes less into their wheelie bins compared to the same period last year.\nTL;DR: Four-weekly bin collections in Conwy county are causing an increase in rats, seagulls and flies, a councillor has claimed.\n\nArticle: By Reality Check teamBBC News\n\nCountries across Asia have been struggling to contain the outbreak, which is threatening the livelihoods of millions of families that rely on pig farming. \n\nThe highly contagious and incurable virus is deadly to pigs but not dangerous to humans.\n\nIt's raising particular concern in China which has half the world's pigs.\n\nReality Check looks at the measures being taken to contain the disease.\n\nThe virus, which originally spread from Africa to Europe, can be passed on by direct contact with infected pigs and wild boars, through infected animal feed and on clothing and farm equipment.\n\nThe UN expects the disease to carry on spreading because many small farms lack the funds or expertise to protect their herds. There is no way of treating infected animals.  \n\nMillions of pigs are being culled in a desperate attempt to halt the disease, according to the latest UN figures. \n\nChina first to declare outbreak\n\nChina reported a swine fever outbreak in August 2018 and since then, the virus has spread to almost all parts of the country, says Martin Yip, of the BBC Chinese service. \n\nAuthorities moved to cull pigs and shut down live meat markets after confirmed outbreaks, as well as banning farmers from feeding their animals with human food leftovers. This is a common practice for small-scale domestic pig owners which risks spreading the disease. \n\nChina has been praised by Dr Monique Eloit, the head of World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), for its effort to combat swine fever.  \n\nHowever, some people suspect the scale of the outbreak has been under-reported. \n\nMany people in China rely heavily on pork, and the economic consequences could be devastating for farmers. \n\nPork prices rose by 29.3% in the year to May, according to government figures, and could rise even higher. \n\nSpread across Vietnam\n\nIn February 2019, Vietnam became the third Asian country, after China and Mongolia, to report the outbreak, says Quynh Le, of the BBC's Vietnamese service.\n\nThe disease has spread to all 63 cities and provinces. The government warns that the outbreak poses the biggest challenge yet to the country's livestock industry.\n\nIn March, the prime minister banned the transportation, trade, slaughtering, and consumption of pig and pork products suspected of being smuggled into the country. \n\nFamers have been promised compensation for culled pigs worth a minimum of 80% of the market price.\n\nThe outbreak has remained severe in spite of government efforts.\n\nIt is projected that pork production in Vietnam will fall by at least 10% this year. \n\nPrecautionary measures for South Korea\n\nNorth Korea reported an outbreak of African swine fever to the World Organisation for Animal Health at the end of May, says Hyung Eun Kim of the BBC Korean service.\n\nSouth Korea offered quarantine and medical assistance to the North, but officials say they've had no response. \n\nHowever, North Korean state media has been warning people about the disease since the end of 2018, says Jo Chung Hee, a North Korean defector who used to work in the country's agriculture department. \n\nSouth Korea is taking measures to prevent the disease from entering the country. These include a ban on using food waste to feed livestock. \n\nThe South Korean military has been authorised to kill any wild boars seen crossing the zone which separates North and South Korea.  \n\nIt's unlikely that infected boars would be able to cross this heavily fortified and mined region. But the South Korean prime minister has visited the area several times to raise awareness of the disease.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: The Philippines is the latest country to report cases of African swine fever and has culled more than 7,000 pigs in an effort to control the spread of the disease.\n\nArticle: There are now 88,000 people unemployed and looking for work - 5.9% of the working age population, according to Office for National Statistics figures released on Wednesday.\n\nBut the unemployment rate in Wales is still higher than the UK rate of 5.2%. \n\nAlthough unemployment is down, the employment level has also fallen and there is a rise in economic inactivity.\n\nThis includes people who are not working or classed as unemployed, for example studying or caring for a family member.\n\nThe Welsh government said over the past year, Wales had\"outperformed almost every other part of the UK\", recording the joint largest fall in the unemployment rate and the second largest increase in the rate of employment. \n\nWelsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the\"fruits of Welsh economic recovery\"were evident across the country. \n\nBut he added the mixed figures show\"there is absolutely no room for complacency\"and the recovery was\"fragile\".\nTL;DR: The number of people out of work has fallen in Wales, with

also said a third runway would cost the public nothing and\"add about \u00a38 billion to the GDP of this country\".\n\nThe government will begin an aviation consultation this summer.\n\nAt Lords question time, Lord Spicer, a former aviation minister, said:\"Surely the government should accept that Heathrow airport is now full up and there is a desperate need therefore for the construction as soon as possible of a third runway.\"\n\n'Brake on growth'\n\nLord Tugendhat, a former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, added:\"Heathrow and Gatwick are two great national assets and the expansion of both airports would do wonders for the British economy.\n\n\"It would be very beneficial both in terms of the work to be done in the short term and the expansion of capacity.\n\n\"If the government refuses to allow a third runway at Heathrow it will be imposing a brake on the growth of the British economy.\"\n\nEarl Attlee, government transport spokesman in the Lords, said that following the consultation, the government's future aviation strategy would be announced next spring.\n\nBut he reiterated that ministers were opposed to a third runway and, on the issue of the consultation, added:\"I think it is unlikely that we will discover that we have not maxed out on what Heathrow's affected population can tolerate.\"\n\nIn January, the Free Enterprise Group of more than 30 Conservative MPs also called on the government to rethink its decision to rule out a third runway, saying the UK was falling behind other European cities in terms of transport links. \n\nIt suggested compensating homeowners near Heathrow with up to \u00a340,000. \n\nIn his Budget speech, Chancellor George Osborne said the country must\"confront the lack of airport capacity in the south east of England\".\nTL;DR: The government has been urged by Conservative peers to abandon its opposition to a third runway at London Heathrow.\n\nArticle: Rhian DeSouza, 43, who had admitted two

a\"substantial sum\"to leave the EU.\n* However, the article also stated that the\"EU will have no say in how we run our country\"if we vote to leave the EU.\n* In a 2016 article, Johnson wrote that the UK would have to pay a\"divorce bill\"to the EU if it left the EU.\n* However, he also stated that the bill would be\"small\"compared to the amount of money the UK pays to the EU each year.\n* The

any money to the EU to leave the EU.\n* The UK government has also stated that the UK will have to pay a\"divorce bill\"to the EU if it leaves the EU.\n* However, the government has also stated that the amount of money the UK pays to the EU each year is \u00a313.1 billion.\n* The BBC's Reality Check unit found that the claim that the UK will have to pay for an EU exit is based on a\"divorce bill\"that is not agreed upon and is still being negotiated.\n* The unit also found that the claim is based on a figure that is not confirmed and is still being disputed.\n* The unit concluded that

sacked on Wednesday as defence secretary - had not been accused of a criminal offence, but had lost the PM's confidence.\n\nMr Williamson strenuously denies being the source of the leak.\n\nHe was sacked following an inquiry into the leak, which led to reports in the Daily Telegraph on plans to allow Chinese company Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network.\n\nOpposition MPs have said there should be an investigation into whether the Official Secrets Act had been breached.\n\nBut Mr Lidington told the Commons:\"The prime minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the cabinet secretary does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police.\n\n\"But we would of course co-operate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary.\"\n\nAlthough it's usually up to the police to decide whether to launch criminal investigations, alleged leaks of government information are dealt with differently.\n\nAfter 2008, when Scotland Yard became embroiled in a huge row over an inquiry into Home Office leaks, which resulted in the arrest of MP Damian Green, strict procedures were put in place.\n\nThe guidelines suggest leaks should be investigated within Whitehall first and referred to police only if there's evidence of a serious crime or an offence under the Official Secrets Act.\n\nThe threshold for police involvement is\"high\"and the\"proportionality\",\"likely outcomes\"and other ways of\"resolving\"the issue must be considered.\n\nEven if the Metropolitan Police, the lead force on leaks inquiries, was to become involved, it would first have to assess the allegations and liaise with legal experts before deciding whether and how to investigate.\n\nGiven other demands facing the force, and its troubled history of examining alleged wrongdoing by ministers and MPs, a politically charged leaks investigation is the last thing it needs.\n\nMr Lidington said the prime minister was\"the ultimate judge of the standards of behaviour expected of a minister\".\n\nHe said ministers should\"shut up\"after National Security Council and cabinet meetings, appearing to echo Mr Williamson's words when he told Russia to\"go away and shut up\"soon into his job as defence secretary.\n\nMr Lidington said Mr Williamson had\"not been accused of any criminal offence\"but had\"lost the confidence of the prime minister\", who by sacking him\"acted within the ministerial code\".\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking during a visit to Ethiopia, said it was a\"very, very important principle of our system\"that police, rather than politicians, decide whether to investigate further.\n\nBut Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who called for a police investigation, said:\"In response to receiving the most brutal sacking I can think of, (Mr Williamson) has protested his innocence.\n\n\"Therefore this matter cannot be, as the prime minister says, closed.\"\n\nConservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne argued the process had not been fair, saying:\"Natural justice requires that the evidence is produced so that [Mr Williamson's] reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed, doesn't it?\"\n\nBefore Mr Lidington made his statement to the Commons, his parliamentary private secretary was photographed holding a document - seemingly intended to be hidden from view - stating that the prime minister's decision\"does not affect\"Mr Williamson's membership of the Privy Council.\n\nThe body, whose members are referred to as\"right honourable\", is made up of about 600 people, including past and present cabinet ministers.\n\nMeanwhile, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the force would\"look at any complaint\"made regarding the leak, but it had received no referral from the Cabinet Office.\n\nShe said there was a\"formal process\"for dealing with alleged breaches of Official Secrets Act and police needed a referral.\n\nWhat is the Official Secrets Act 1989?\n\nDisclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a\"Crown servant\"- including government ministers - can be illegal.\n\nFor it to be an offence the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties).\n\nBeing found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison.  \n\nIf the police were to launch an investigation, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would decide whether there was to be a prosecution.\n\nRead more: What is the Official Secrets Act?\n\nAn inquiry into the leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the council's confidential discussions - including warnings from several cabinet members about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei.\n\nAt a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that suggested he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure.\n\nIn a letter confirming his dismissal, she said:\"No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified.\"\n\nIn response, Mr Williamson - defence secretary since 2017 - wrote he was\"confident\"that a\"thorough and formal inquiry\"would have\"vindicated\"his position.\n\n\"I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,\"he said.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson talked to Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but\"that absolutely does not prove\"he leaked the story to him.\n\nThe National Security Council is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed.\n\nIt is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act.\n\nThere has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring.\n\nThe US has been campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G, because of its security concerns. \n\nHuawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government.\n\nPenny Mordaunt has taken over as defence secretary - the first woman in the role - and prisons minister Rory Stewart is replacing her as international development secretary.\nTL;DR: The government does not think it necessary to refer the National Security Council leak to the police, the PM's de facto deputy says.\n\nArticle: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter\n\nYes, you read that right, top of Theresa May's list at the EU summit won't be giving the long-running talks a shove forward.  \n\nThe deal over the transition period - the buffer zone between Brexit and the ending of all ties - only needs to be rubber stamped on Friday. \n\nOf course, there are many more tangles to be sorted in the coming months. But tonight, the prime minister's main goal is to try to stiffen up the EU's response to the threat from Russia. \n\nAt home, Theresa May has taken a firm rhetorical tone, in response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. \n\nWhat the government hopes for in the next 24 hours though, is that the other EU nations are willing to come alongside in the same way. \n\nThe US, UK, France and Germany signed up to a very strong and uncompromising statement last week. \n\nBut the prime minister will tonight try to create a similarly strong and united front among the other 27 EU member states. \n\nIn extremely blunt language UK government officials have been briefing that Russia is a\"strategic enemy\"of Europe. \n\nTheresa May will tell her counterparts that it is a risk to all. Number 10 wants a robust statement from everyone in response, a show of unity, and by implication, other countries to look to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin.\n\nShe might not get her way, however. EU countries may share the UK's security concerns about Russia. \n\nBut member states like Greece and Hungary have their own reasons for concerns about taking a more hostile approach. \n\nCan the prime minister get consensus tonight, even persuade other countries to start taking similar action against Russia? \n\nIt would never have been a straightforward quest to get more than two dozen countries into the same position. \n\nBut with one foot out of the door, does the UK's foreign policy influence have the same stretch? \n\nThis is one of the first tests of whether Brexit is harming Britain's powers of persuasion. \n\nWill the rest of the EU see Theresa May tonight as the close friend who can hold the room, or with a year until exit, has she just become the awkward neighbour?\nTL;DR: Guess what?

And it was a serious mistake.\n\n\"I was too trusting of my bosses, as it were, to see as I saw, all the difficulties with it. They went gung ho and introduced it overnight in one go, which was never my plan and I thought they must know what there were doing - but they didn't.\"\n\nIn the London poll tax riots in 1990, up to 3,000 demonstrators turned on police. Of 113 people injured, 45 were police.\n\nBy the end of the year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had stood down.

What we need to see is political will and a change to the mindset where we tolerate the things that promote obesity.\n\nThis would not only mean the end of the kind of culture where the sale of unhealthy foods and drinks in hospital waiting rooms is seen as acceptable.\n\nIt could also mean fewer people end up in those waiting rooms in the first place.\nTL;DR: Hospitals are, by definition, buildings that are dedicated to health. \n\nBut in this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Rachel Thompson, deputy head of science at World Cancer Research Fund, says that good work is being undermined by the contents of hospital vending machines.\n\nArticle: The Chinese firm, one of the biggest smartphone vendors behind Apple and Samsung, said that its shipments also rose 44% to 108 million units.\n\nThe company's growth figures come as it launched its latest flagship smartphone - the Huawei Mate 8 - in Las Vegas. \n\nIts telecom devices for carriers, such as routers, are banned in the US.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company is also one of the world's largest telecommunications firms, but has been blocked from participating in broadband projects in the US and Australia over espionage fears.\n\nBut other businesses, such as consumer electronic products including mobile devices, are allowed into the US market.\n\nHigh-margin challenge\n\nHuawei's smartphone business has been growing rapidly.

providing quality patient care.\"\n\nGPs have long complained the 48-hour target can put the most seriously-ill patients at risk as appointments get clogged up with people who do not need immediate access.\n\nDr Laurence Buckman, of the British Medical Association, said:\"We would welcome the scrapping of this target as it will give GPs greater flexibility to organise their appointment booking system in a way that best suits their local patient population.\"\n\nBut the Patients Association said it was concerned about the speed of the changes.\n\nSpokeswoman Katherine Murphy said while moving away from targets was the\"right idea\", it was important to have something in place first to stop a\"free for all\".\n\nThe changes in the other areas are seen as much less radical.\n\nThe hospital waiting target move is more relevant to managers than patients.\n\nThe guidance makes it clear hospitals will still be expected to see patients in 18 weeks, but they will not have to prove it to local managers, meaning less paper-work.\n\nMeanwhile, the threshold for seeing A&E patients within four hours will be lowered from 98% of patients to 95%.\n\nThe move is just the start of what will be a complete change in how performance is managed in emergency departments.\n\nA new measurement is likely to be introduced, which is likely to include an element of waiting alongside other factors such as access to scans.\n\nThe idea, again, is to focus on quality rather than just what is deemed to be the rather blunt instrument of waiting time.\n\nIn the guidance issued to the NHS in England, Mr Lansley also makes it clear that these changes can help save money on management - 46% in the coming years.\n\nHowever, that still equates to a modest saving for the health service as management accounts for less than 2% of its budget.\nTL;DR: Patients in England will no longer be guaranteed a GP appointment within 48 hours under a scaling back of NHS targets.\n\nArticle: Work includes rebuilding canal-side walls and clearing vegetation off locks.\n\nBuilt by the Swansea Canal Navigation Company between 1794 and 1798, the canal runs 16.5 miles (26.5km) from Swansea to Hen Neuadd in Powys.\n\nBut since 1958, parts have been abandoned, sold off and filled in.\n\n\"It could take many, many years -

Theresa May, dependent on them for votes, pivoted to a UK-wide backstop which she was never able to get through the Commons. \n\nNow the maths is different. Boris Johnson is well short of the numbers he needs for a workable administration, with or without the DUP, and an election looks inevitable. \n\nAsked about reports that the government might shift back towards an NI only backstop, the Chancellor Sajid Javid responded negatively.\n\nHe repeated the prime minister's mantra that the backstop is not democratic.\n\nThe unionist objection has been that, under the backstop, the people of NI would be left subject to EU rules with no way for their local representatives to approve reject or change them. \n\nHowever, could this concern be allayed by providing an enhanced role for Stormont politicians in scrutinising and/or approving any European agricultural or other trade regulations which might apply in NI?\n\nInconvenient truth \n\nSome influential figures believe a backstop could be devised which incorporates the principle of consent built into the Good Friday Agreement. \n\nThey argue that by harnessing the agreement, a compromise could be found on the island of Ireland. \n\nThis in turn might address the fear that the backstop is nothing but a trap set by Brussels which would constrain UK sovereignty after Brexit. \n\nDevising some mechanism for Stormont input into a Northern Ireland only backstop is fraught with difficulty. \n\nMake it too weak and it would look like meaningless consultation. Make it too strong and the EU would balk at the notion that any changes to its future trade rules could be subject to a unionist veto at Stormont. \n\nThere is, moreover, the rather inconvenient truth that we currently have no working Stormont assembly or power-sharing executive. Why on earth should you give a failed institution extra responsibility? \n\nAdditionally, there will be suspicions on both sides. \n\nNationalists and the Alliance Party have previously advised the EU not to concede any substantial role for Stormont in the backstop as they fear it would simply invite unionism to wield its veto. \n\nThe DUP has cautiously welcomed the PM's food zone idea. \n\nBut DUP politicians may look over their shoulders at the traditional unionists who have already rejected the all-Ireland food zone as a slippery slope which would see NI increasingly diverging from Great Britain. \n\nThe swiftly changing politics at Westminster may mean both the food zone and the idea of Stormont playing a role in a\"backstop with consent\"never get off the drawing board. \n\nHowever that doesn't mean officials won't want to tease out such proposals in order to see if they might provide an escape route from the potentially destabilising consequences of a no-deal Brexit.\nTL;DR:

but the public rightly expects that this is not abused.\"\n\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said it was\"only right\"that officers should be compensated for overtime.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent\n\n\"Overtime does not go sick or take leave.\" \n\nThat pithy phrase, from Tim Godwin, the former Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner, sums up the usefulness of overtime to a service that has to cope with sudden and unexpected events. \n\nWhether it's the surveillance officer monitoring a terrorism suspect, the detective constable deployed on a murder investigation, or the civilian staff employee answering calls after hours because a colleague has gone home ill - overtime has a valuable part to play.  \n\nSir Tom Winsor's review recognised that, while also recommending changes designed to reduce the overall bill.  \n\nThe year-on-year increase, identified by 5 live's research, does not mean that work has stalled.  \n\nBut it's interesting to note that some overtime payments appear to be connected to staff shortages.  \n\nAs the police workforce shrinks further, it may well be that existing officers and staff are increasingly asked to plug the gaps.\n\n'For the Queen'\n\nFigures for 39 forces in England and Wales show the overtime bill rose from \u00a3307.1m in 2013/14 to \u00a3313.2m in 2014/15.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police accounted for about a third of the overall bill, while in two other forces, Bedfordshire and Cleveland, the overtime bill went up by 50% - explained in part by gaps in recruitment. \n\nThe Met said officers earning the highest amounts were in specialist roles, where working time was determined by the operational circumstances.\n\nAn officer at West Midlands Police earned \u00a332,702 in overtime working in a contact centre.\n\nInspector Tony Morris from that force said\"recruitment in this business area has been on hold\"due to a reorganisation. \n\n\"This means the department has been carrying a significant number of vacancies, resulting in an increased need for planned overtime.\"\n\nSergeants and constables are eligible to claim overtime for working extra days, for staying on at the end of a shift, or for being recalled between shifts.\n\nOn four days each week, officers are expected to give the first 30 minutes of unplanned overtime for free, traditionally referred to as\"half an hour for the Queen\".\n\nThree years ago, Sir Tom Winsor's review of policing in England and Wales called for\"cultural change\"to reduce the cost of overtime.\n\nHe suggested that in future, the police pay review body may consider a\"buy out\"for sergeants which would see them give up overtime pay in return for an increased salary.\n\nOvertime for inspectors was\"bought out\"in 1994.\n\nCuts regime\n\nSouth Wales Police reported the biggest percentage increase for overtime spending in the last year, from \u00a35.2m in 2013/14 to \u00a38.4m in 2014/15.\n\nThe force said the majority of that increase was due to the Nato summit in September 2014, which involved 9,500 officers from across the UK, including 1,500 from South Wales.\n\nBut in Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures were down on the previous year.\n\nPolice Scotland spent \u00a318.2m on overtime in 2014/15, a reduction of \u00a36m on the previous year.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland also spent less, down by \u00a311.5m from \u00a359.2m in 2013/14 to \u00a347.7m in 2014/15.\n\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said:\"Overtime is called upon when it is essential to maintain operational effectiveness and, in the context of capital city policing and national responsibilities, there are times when there is a genuine need to call on officers to work beyond their scheduled hours to police unforeseen events, to provide security, or public reassurance.\"\n\nThe force said the London Olympic and Paralympic Games had a particular impact on its overtime bill for 2012/13 - when forces in England and Wales spent a total of \u00a3354.9m.\n\nChief Constable Francis Habgood from the National Police Chiefs' Council said:\"Overtime is a very flexible - and can be a very cost-effective - way of managing unexpected demand and it is only right that officers whose lives are disrupted by a last-minute order to work an extended tour of duty or work on a rest day are compensated for that disruption. \n\n\"With the current cuts regime, we are doing all we can to ensure that the police service offers the best value for taxpayers' money and all forces have reduced overtime spend in recent years.\"\nTL;DR: Some UK police forces are using overtime to cover gaps caused by staff shortages, BBC Radio 5 live has found.\n\nArticle: By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent\n\nThe Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) is recommending a basic universal income. \n\nIn a new report, the author calls the approach the best alternative\"to help people improve their own lives\".\n\nThe RSA estimates that its proposal would cost about an extra 1% of annual national income (GDP). \n\nThe idea is in principle fairly straightforward: a standard payment is made to every citizen. The report illustrates how it might work using data for taxes and benefits in 2012-2013. \n\nThe basic income for people aged between 25 and 65 would in this example be \u00a33,692. There is a pension of about double that amount for those older than 65. \n\nThere would be a basic income for children too: for the first child it would be higher than the working age adult basic until they reach school age. Above that age, and for all children after the first, it would be below that level.\n\nRadical change\n\nThe proposal does involve some cost, but it does replace many existing benefits and it would eliminate the personal income tax allowance. The basic income would mean there would not be the need for the first slug of earnings to be tax-free. \n\nIt would clearly be a radical change - so why does the RSA think it necessary?\n\nAnthony Painter, its director of policy and strategy and author of the report, says:\"The welfare state has become incredibly complex whilst locking those it seeks to help in a vicious circle of low pay, insecurity and an intrusive state.\"\n\nThe RSA's plan picks up an idea that has gained popularity in recent years.  Finland is undertaking a pilot scheme, although it will not report its results until 2019.\n\nSome cities in the Netherlands are also looking at the idea. There is also a debate in Switzerland about introducing a basic income.\n\nIn the UK, the idea is being promoted by a group called the Citizen's Income Trust (CIT) and the RSA proposals are based on their ideas.\n\nThe potential advantages include simplicity of administration given that you only need to establish that the person receiving it is a citizen.\n\nThere is a nod in the RSA proposal to the political debate in the UK about European migrants and benefits. They would be eligible only after contributing for a number of years. \n\nWelfare trap\n\nOne of the aims of the proposal is to reduce the disincentive to work - or to work more - that comes with the withdrawal of means-tested benefits. \n\nAs a recipient's income rises, entitlement to most benefits declines and they can be left with only a very small amount of any additional income.  It's known as the poverty trap or welfare trap. \n\nIf there is no means testing, the disincentive would come from income tax and national insurance. \n\nThe RSA does also include some means-testing in the basic idea. For people with incomes over \u00a375,000, their entitlement would be gradually withdrawn, completely so for any with an income of more than \u00a3150,000.\n\nThere is also a complication in these proposals: the treatment of housing costs. They vary so much around the country that it is difficult to build them into a single national basic income.  \n\nThe RSA proposal does not cover housing costs, and it suggests investigation of various possible reforms of housing benefits that are means tested.  \n\nThe RSA suggests further work on three options for housing costs. Two of them would involve withdrawing the benefit with rising income, and one would not, although it would be linked to local housing market conditions.  \n\nLosers\n\nTim Blackwell, writing in the New Statesman, identified housing benefit and council tax as a major weakness when he looked at the CIT proposals. He said that the combined effect of tax, national insurance and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax support was to leave the individual with just over 10% of any additional income they might earn.\n\nIn terms of how wins and who loses, much depends on the precise of levels chosen, but is certainly possible that there will be groups who lose out.  Under the CIT scheme, Mr Blackwell wrote that\"lone parent tenants in need of childcare would do very badly\". \n\nThis general approach has been supported by the Green Party in the UK.

He has also said the criticism levelled against his government over the fires was\"disproportionate\".\n\nWhile the figures for October - traditionally a month when rains bring some relief - are particularly alarming, those for the year so far are also worrying environmentalists.  \n\nAccording to Inpe, 93,485 fires have been recorded in the Amazon so far this year - 25% more than in the same period in 2019, when President Bolsonaro's handling of the forest fires drew international condemnation.\n\nBrazil's Amazon region has been the hardest hit, with 46% of all blazes occurring there. \n\nBut environmentalists are also alarmed by the steep rise in fires in the Pantanal, one of the world's most biodiverse areas and home to animals such as the jaguar and the capuchin monkey.\n\nMariana Napolitano, the head of the science programme at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil, told the AFP news agency that despite the four-month government-imposed ban on lighting fires, some of the blazes appeared to be man-made. \n\n\"After deforesting the jungle, the offenders set fires to clean up the accumulated organic material...

with overall discards of cod, haddock and whiting reduced from 47% of catch in 2007 to 18% in 2012, whilst landings have increased by 6,056 tonnes.\n\n\"We will consider the report's findings, although we have no evidence that this is having an adverse impact on wildlife.\"\n\nResilient birds\n\nThe  European Commission conceded that the ban might affect seabirds in the short term but said there was evidence they would swiftly adapt.\n\nA spokeswoman for the fisheries commissioner said:\"It is well known that species of seabirds such as herring gulls and fulmars have grown accustomed to feeding on discards and their populations have increased significantly.\n\n\"Undoubtedly such species will be impacted in the short term as a result of the landing obligation. \n\n\"But recent research carried out by scientists from Plymouth University in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has given clear indications that such species are very resilient and should adapt by switching to alternative food sources over time.\"\n\nLang Banks, director of environment group WWF Scotland, said the common fisheries policy was only one of a number of measures aimed at delivering healthier seas.\n\nHe added:\"We believe that by working with the industry, government and others, it will be possible to find effective solutions that will deliver benefits both for conservation and for those who depend upon our seas for a living.\n\n\"Those solutions are likely to require changes in industry behaviour and gear use so that non-target fish and other marine life are avoided in the first instance.\"\u202c\nTL;DR: A ban on skippers throwing unwanted fish back into the sea may actually be bad for the environment, according to academics.\n\nArticle: UK Coal intends to close Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire and Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said redundancy letters were being posted to 57 Kellingley workers and to about 270 Thoresby workers.\n\nUK Coal has not yet commented on the claims.\n\nChris Kitchen, general secretary of the NUM, said:\"I can't see it's in anybody's interests to issue redundancy notices to anybody today, given that the company don't even know if they've got the financing in place for their 18-month closure plan.\"\n\nThe government has offered to loan UK Coal \u00a310m to execute an 18-month\"managed closure\"of the two mines.\n\nBut the NUM is considering an employee buyout of Kellingley Colliery.\n\nMr Kitchen added:\"Given that the pits are performing better than expected, these redundancies could be put on hold, which would give a better chance of a rescue package being put together -

Prison staff are not allowed to smoke anywhere.\n\nA Scottish Prison Service spokesman said they were developing plans to deliver smoke-free prisons in Scotland, but no timeframe for this was available.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Department of Justice said it had no plans to change the current rules, under which smoking is permitted in prison cells and certain open spaces.\nTL;DR: The ban on smoking in public places does not apply to state prisons, the Court of Appeal has ruled.\n\nArticle: By Tom EspinerBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nBut there are concerns that many firms have not done enough to prepare for the new rules, known as GDPR.\n\nBig fines could be imposed on companies that\"persistently, deliberately or negligently flout the regulations\", the UK's data watchdog says.\n\nBut it told small businesses there is no need to panic and that it is\"here to help\".\n\nWhat is GDPR?\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all organisations that handle European Union citizens' data.\n\nThe rules give consumers new rights, including rights to find out what data is being held on them, and to delete that information, unless a firm has a good reason to keep it.\n\nCompanies now have to get consumers' explicit consent to use personal information, unless they have a lawful reason not to, and getting people to give more personal information in exchange for a premium service is not allowed.\n\nFirms also have to meet higher standards for keeping data safe.\n\nMany have been sending out emails asking people to renew their consent to receive marketing.\n\nAre the rules good news for consumers?\n\nDefinitely, says the Which? consumer rights group.\n\n\"GDPR will strengthen your personal data rights, including the way companies handle your data and redress for misuse of that data,\"says Which? consumer rights expert Adam French.\n\n\"Companies will need to tell you exactly what you're signing up for and you will have more control when it comes to opting out of future communications.\n\n\"You will also have more opportunities to make a claim for damage caused by the misuse of your data,\"he says.\n\nAilidh Callander, legal officer for campaign group Privacy International, says the new rules have\"been a long time coming\".\n\n\"GDPR is an important step in the right direction,\"she says.\n\nWhy are companies concerned?\n\nThe penalties for wrongdoing could be quite hefty, especially for big companies. \n\nThe new rules give the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) powers to fine firms up to \u20ac20m (\u00a317.5m) or 4% of global annual turnover for serious breaches.\n\nMany smaller firms may not be prepared for the regulations coming into force, business body the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says.\n\n\"GDPR is here and the likelihood is that many of the UK's 5.7 million smaller businesses will not be compliant,\"chairman Mike Cherry said. \n\nHe says the\"burden and scale\"of the reforms have proven too much to handle for some. \n\nAnd he says many small firms fear the ICO will be heavy handed in dealing with non-compliance,\"slapping\"them with fines.\n\nWhat does the watchdog say?\n\nElizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that small businesses which did not make extensive use of customer data would not come under close scrutiny. \n\nInstead, the focus would be on big companies - particularly those in the technology sector - that\"deliberately, persistently or negligently misuse data\", she said.\n\nWhile small businesses\"should not panic\"if they suffer a data breach, Ms Denham said there were some basic steps that companies should take to protect data.\n\nAs well as individuals being able to bring a complaint to the ICO, she said it could take action as it did in the case of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.\n\nShe acknowledges there will be no grace period for businesses - the rules will be fully enforced from 25 May.\n\nHowever, she says firms have had two years to prepare.\n\nAre all businesses worried?\n\nBusiness body the CBI believes many firms are ready for the new rules.\n\n\"You only need to look at your inbox to see businesses up and down the country are stepping up to make sure people are aware of their privacy policies,\"a CBI spokeswoman said.\n\nBut firms that aren't compliant\"need to get their action plan sorted quickly\", she said.\n\nThe ICO is ready to help, and businesses should also consider getting external legal advice, she said.\n\n\"GDPR marks a watershed moment in how businesses deal with people's data...

Here are eight things you probably didn't know about it.\n\nGlorious industrial past\n\nDuring the heyday of the industrial revolution, Wallonia became the second most industrialised area in the world after Britain, thanks to its deposits of coal and iron, and was Belgium's richer half.\n\nSince then, however, the tables have turned. Wallonia's smokestack industries collapsed as Flanders developed a dynamic services economy and the Flemish GDP roared ahead. The Walloons are now the poor relations.\n\nMakes M4 assault rifle\n\nWallonia does, though, produce a lot of weapons and medication. It is home to FN Herstal, which makes the M4 assault rifle and is owned by the Wallonia government. It is also home to pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. \n\nSo there is some economic diversity but - as the Financial Times newspaper notes - a diet of bullets and pills is not altogether healthy.\n\nMagritte came from there\n\nWallonia's most famous artist is Rene Magritte, who hailed from Lessines. Magritte, whose mother committed suicide when he was young, wore a trademark bowler hat and painted in his lounge. \n\nHis surrealist paintings have inspired pop and conceptual art, the cover of a Rolling Stones record, a video by Oasis, and a song by Paul Simon. One of his paintings sold for $11.5m (about \u00a39.4m) in New York in 2002 and there is a museum dedicated to his work in Brussels.\n\nLost Magritte mystery'jigsaw puzzle' piece uncovered in Norwich\n\n...and the creator of detective Maigret\n\nGeorges Simenon was a prolific author who wrote hundreds of novels, including 75 that featured his best known character, Paris detective Commissaire Maigret, \n\nHe was born in Liege and worked on the city newspaper before becoming an author. He also achieved notoriety in 1977 for claiming to have slept with 10,000 women since the age of 13. \n\nContains'ugliest city'\n\nThe biggest city in Wallonia, Charleroi is known for its grim post-industrial decay and was voted the ugliest city in the world in a Dutch newspaper survey. It also has a reputation for corruption. \n\nIn fact it's so bad it's good. Enterprising locals offer an\"urban safari\"through the blight, taking visitors to Belgium's\"most depressing street\"and stopping by the home of notorious serial killer Marc Dutroux. Graffiti is ubiquitous and the city has drawn comparisons with Berlin and even Brooklyn as it looks to achieve its own rise from the ruins.\n\nHome of French fries?\n\nIt's controversial, but there is a theory that French fries may actually be from Belgium. It is said that US soldiers stationed in Belgium during World War Two may have called them French fries because the locals were speaking French.\n\nThe Spanish introduced potatoes to Europe in the 15th Century and there is some evidence that the first potatoes were fried in the 17th Century between Liege and Dinant in Wallonia. \n\nIt is thought that people in the area were fond of frying small fish from the River Meuse and when the river froze over one year they began frying strips of potato instead.\n\nAudrey Hepburn is'Wallonian'\n\nA tenuous claim, but not one that the Wallonian authorities are giving up on. Iconic actress Hepburn was born in Brussels in 1929 and spent her childhood between Belgium, England and the Netherlands.\n\nWallonia is linked to Brussels through the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, a political entity that has responsibilities in the areas of culture, education and sport.\n\nAs a result, the Brussels-Wallonia Tourist Board and Wallonia's representative office in the UK are happy to refer to her as one of their own.\n\nHalf'want to be French'\n\nUnlike the Flemish, the Walloons do not consider themselves a nation or desire an independent state - and this isn't just due to their economic weakness. A poll found that only a tiny minority of Walloons wanted Belgium to break up and if secession was forced on them, about half wanted to be attached to France.\n\nSome have even called for such a move, particularly in the city of Liege, a free principality for 800 years before joining Belgium. \n\nPeople there have strong cultural ties to the\"chtis\", as people from northern France are known.\"A mere two centuries of Belgium have not severed those bonds,\"one Liege resident told the BBC.\nTL;DR: Has Wallonia ever enjoyed such a high profile?\n\nArticle: The funds will go to the British Red Cross and Red International, which are working to deliver food and medicine to civilians in Syria.\n\nThousands of people have died during months of unrest since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nA government spokesman said:\"Almost 4,500 people will benefit from this.\"\n\nHe added:\"The money donated by the committee will help the charities provide an ambulance service and provision of life-saving first aid, clinics to provide healthcare for people with chronic conditions, distribution of hygiene kits, and of food, blankets, mattresses and cooking kits.\"\n\nThe committee has also allocated about \u00a340,000 to Oxfam to help 85,000 in a refugee camp in Sudan.\n\nThe charity has appealed for help to provide clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene equipment.\nTL;DR: The Isle of Man government's overseas aid committee has donated about \u00a325,000 to help international charities working in the Middle East.\n\nArticle: Laurence Soper, 74, was extradited to face 19 charges of indecent and serious sexual assault against 10 former pupils at the independent St Benedict's School in Ealing, where he taught.\n\nSoper fled to Kosovo with \u00a3182,000 from the Vatican bank in a bid to avoid prosecution for molesting boys.\n\nAn Old Bailey jury took 14 hours to find him guilty of all charges.\n\nProsecutor Gillian Etherton QC told how the victims were subjected to sadistic beatings by Soper for\"fake reasons\"and on many occasions\"with what can only have been a sexual motive\".\n\nThey included kicking a football\"in the wrong direction\",\"failing to use double margins\", and\"using the (wrong) staircase\", leading to a caning and a sexual assault, she said.\n\nMs Etherton said at least one of Soper's alleged victims suffered serious mental health problems, while another was too afraid to speak out because the abusers\"were like saints to me\".\n\nThe court heard Soper quit as an abbot in 2000 and moved to Rome. He then skipped bail and spent six years living in Kosovo, with a European Arrest Warrant issued for his extradition.\n\nSoper denied using the cane as a ruse to abuse boys who were given the choice of six lashes with trousers on, or three with them off.\n\nHe told jurors he went on the run out of\"stupidity and cowardice\", fearing that his life's work would be wrecked.\n\nSt Benedict's: A history of abuse\n\nSoper is the latest in a string of men to face allegations relating to their work at St Benedict's.\n\n In 2010, Abbot Shipperlee announced an independent review of safeguarding arrangements, policies and procedures.\n\nThe following year, Lord Carlile produced a damning report calling for tougher rules to protect all faith pupils and stripped monks of control at the school.\n\nIn a statement issued by Lord Carlile QC, the school apologised for the\"serious wrongs of the past\".\n\nHe said:\"The school regrets that Soper did not have the courage to plead guilty. The result has been that innocent victims, whom he abused when they were boys in the school, were compelled to give evidence.\n\n\"The tough lessons of the past have been learned, and the errors and crimes of the past are in the daily consciousness and conscience of the school management.\"\n\nSoper was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 19 December.\nTL;DR: An ex-Roman Catholic priest has been found guilty of abusing boys at a London school during the 1970s and 80s.\n\nArticle: The announcement came after Kim Yo-jong - sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - said recent balloon-senders were\"human scum\".\n\nFor years, activists and defectors have sent messages criticising the North and its leadership across the border.\n\nBut the South Korean government said the balloons caused\"tension\".\n\nOne group told the BBC they had no plans to stop - and had another one million leaflets on order.\n\nIn the past, the balloons have also carried dollar notes, and even chocolate. \n\nIn 2014 North Korean soldiers attempted to shoot them down - leading to an exchange of fire across the border.\n\nThe North has also sent its own leaflets on helium balloons across the border in the past, demanding - among other things - an end to\"further hostilities or stupid actions\".\n\nWhat did Kim Yo-jong say about the balloons?\n\nKim Yo-jong - who holds a powerful position in the North Korean government - issued a long statement on Thursday, blaming\"defectors from the North\"for recent leaflets.\n\n\"I wonder if the world knows what kind of riff-raff those foolish defectors are,\"said the statement, translated by KCNA Watch.\n\n\"Human scum - little short of wild animals who betrayed their own homeland - are engrossed in such unbecoming acts... they are sure to be called mongrel dogs as they bark in where they should not.\"\n\nMs Kim then said the\"owners of the mongrel dogs\"- that is, the South Korean government - should be held to account.\n\nShe threatened to scrap a no-hostility military pact, shut down the North-South liaison office, and withdraw from the joint-venture Kaesong Industrial Park.\n\nHow did the South react?\n\nThe South Korean government said it was planning legislation against the balloons, which they called\"tension-causing\".\n\n\"Actually, most of the leaflets have been found in our territory, causing environmental pollution and increasing burden on local people to get rid of them,\"said Ministry of Unification spokesperson Yoh Sang-key.\n\n\"Any act that could pose a threat to the life and property of those people should be stopped.\"\n\nWhat do the balloon senders say?\n\nPark Sang-hak, the chairman of Fighters for a Free North Korea, said they were undeterred - and had recently ordered another one million leaflets.\n\nHis group sent leaflets across the border 11 times last year, and three times this year.

North Korea makes a demand - and hours later, South Korea complies.\n\nThese balloon launches have always been a sore point between the two sides. \n\nSeoul is trying to re-establish ties with Pyongyang after a year of very little contact. There's even a push to amend a law which would allow North Korean firms to do businesses in South Korean territory.\n\nThe long-term logic of President Moon's administration is that engaging with North Korea will eventually lead to better human rights for its people.\n\nBut it's a tricky line to navigate. \n\nSouth Korea is home to those who've escaped the North Korean regime.

This would boost present numbers by around a third, although it would leave the American presence far short of its peak of 100,000 in 2010-11.  \n\nBut Mr Trump's speech also included two important new elements. He launched a blistering attack on Pakistan, publicly articulating what his predecessors only said in private. \n\n\"We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,\"declared the president.\"It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace\". \n\nThis was followed by more threats from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the National Security Council spokesman. And if this were not bad enough for Pakistan, Mr Trump then applauded India's\"important contributions to stability in Afghanistan\", urging New Delhi to play a larger role. \n\nSince the beginning of the war, Pakistan has allowed the use of its territory to supply international troops in landlocked Afghanistan, tacitly accepted American drones over its airspace, and co-operated with Western intelligence agencies against some terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. \n\nHowever, Pakistan's intelligence agency, the ISI, has also given shelter and support to Afghan insurgents from the 1970s to the present, including the especially virulent Haqqani network. Its aim has been to limit India's influence - but is also influenced by its disagreements with Kabul. \n\nEver since partition, Afghan governments of all stripes have rejected the border known as the Durand Line, laying claim to some Pashtun areas inside Pakistan.  \n\nThere are three big questions around Trump's approach to Pakistan. \n\nThe first is whether his words will translate into action. After all, we've been here before.\"We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan\", President Barack Obama told advisers in 2009, sending his CIA chief and national security adviser to Islamabad to deliver the message.  \n\n\"You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours\", warned then Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2011. The same year, America's top military officer publicly declared that the Haqqani network was\"a veritable arm\"of Pakistani intelligence. \n\nHowever, these warnings did not translate into action. Pakistan continued to receive around $1bn per year in so-called Coalition Support Funds, as well as other hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. \n\nThe Trump administration has threatened a range of punishments, including sanctions on Pakistani officials. But will they follow through? This is what Pakistani officials will hope to establish in the coming weeks. \n\nThe second question is how Pakistan will respond. In past crises, Pakistan has blocked Nato supply routes into Afghanistan, such as the Khyber Pass. There are alternative routes via Iran and Russia-dominated Central Asia, but the Trump administration's relations with Tehran and Moscow are even worse. \n\nBeyond this, Pakistan could also shoot American drones out of the sky, ramp up its support for the Taliban, or halt intelligence co-operation entirely. Of course, Pakistan would have to consider the consequences, from losing out on IMF bailouts to provoking open US air strikes.\n\nIncreasingly confident\n\nThe third question is whether Pakistan can be coerced into abandoning a policy that has taken shape over 40 years. \n\nBoth Mr Trump and Mr Tillerson declared their openness to peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan's concern is that if such talks result in its Taliban allies sharing power in Afghanistan, this would reduce the Taliban's dependence on Pakistan. \n\nTaliban leaders who have explored peace talks independently of their Pakistani patrons have ended up arrested or dead. It is possible that Pakistan will decide that it's worth maintaining influence over the Taliban, whatever the cost. \n\nDomestically, Pakistan has continued supporting militants despite the death of 20,000 civilians in terrorist attacks over the past 15 years. \n\nIt's also notable that a meeting of Pakistani military and political leaders on Thursday concluded that the foreign minister should immediately set off on a tour of\"friendly states\", beginning with China. \n\nPakistan is increasingly confident in the support of Beijing, which is investing tens of billions of dollars in the country as part of the ambitious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, it's not entirely clear how far China is willing to go to bail out Pakistan, financially or politically.\n\nFinally, what should we make of Trump's effort to enlist Indian support? Some critics have argued that this is likely to provoke Pakistan into expanding its support for the Taliban. \n\nHowever, we should bear in mind that the US tried to restrict India's role in Afghanistan through the 2000s, with no positive change in Pakistan's behaviour. Instead, Pakistan is believed to have sponsored the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008, though Islamabad denies this.\n\nIndia expanded its security role in Afghanistan from 2011 onwards, when it signed a strategic partnership with Kabul. It expanded its training of Afghan military officers, 4,000 so far, and gave second-hand attack helicopters to the struggling Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). This, too, had no apparent impact on Pakistan's policy. \n\nWe should be realistic about India's potential role. Delhi does not have the capacity to do too much more. It requires co-operation with its old partners Russia or Iran to send military supplies, but both those countries have expanded their own ties with parts of the Taliban in recent years. \n\nWe should also note that President Trump emphasised India's role in the specific areas of\"economic assistance and development\". \n\nThis assistance, to the tune of $2bn (\u00a31.56bn), has contributed to India's popularity amongst Afghans. Delhi would not want military support to put that soft power at risk. \n\nBut on balance, as Western countries focus on terrorist threats from the Middle East and North Africa, and grow more weary of the longest war in their modern history, India's support to a weak Afghan state and its army should probably be welcomed. \n\nUpdate 25 August 2017: The text referring to the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 has been updated to include Islamabad's denial of involvement.\nTL;DR: On Monday night, President Donald Trump unveiled the long awaited results of his policy review of the Afghanistan war.\n\nArticle: A letter addressed:\"Your man Henderson, that boy with the glasses who is doing a PhD up here at Queen's in Belfast.

As well as providing accommodation, it acts as a logistical support centre and has a substantial field hospital. Other facilities include huge air-conditioned gyms, shops, a dry bar called Heroes and even a Pizza Hut.\n\nCamp Leatherneck\n\nAdjoining the British-run core of Camp Bastion is the US compound, Camp Leatherneck, home to thousands of US Marines. The camp has grown in size since it was established in 2008 and has its own dining facilities and gyms.\n\nCamp Shorabak\n\nAfghan security forces also have their own compound - Camp Shorabak. Here troops and police have air-conditioned quarters, dining facilities and the use of a mosque. Shorabak is where international military personnel have been mentoring Afghan troops in preparation for the handover in 2014.\n\nHelicopter base\n\nHelicopters take off and land from an area close to Bastion\u2019s main runways, ready to take part in air transport and combat missions. British aircraft include Apaches, Merlins and Chinooks, while the US fleet includes Apaches, Ospreys and Black Hawks. Prince Harry, currently based at Camp Bastion, qualified as an Apache helicopter pilot in February and will be flying missions from the base.\n\nSecurity\n\nA Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in September showed the base remains a target for insurgents. Two US Marines were killed and a number of aircraft and hangars were damaged. The base is situated in the middle of the desert, providing its manned watchtowers with excellent visibility. It is ringed by a 30ft (9m) fence, coils of wire and blast walls. Cameras, motion sensors and radar monitor movement on the ground and in the air. Click play to see the damage to the hangars at the base.\n\nRunways\n\nNew Harrier jets belonging to the US Marine Corps have arrived at Camp Bastion\u2019s airfield to replace those destroyed in the September Taliban attack. The base has one of the world's busiest airports, with its two runways handling about 600 aircraft a day.

Bastion - with its own water bottling plant, hospital, police force and even Pizza Hut - is widely regarded as a safe haven for troops. However, a Taliban attack breaching the perimeter and resulting in the death of two US Marines has shown it is not impregnable. \n\nWhat's it like inside Camp Bastion?

Feminists worry a new conservative government will reverse the new abortion law.\n\nBoth were Socialist Party initiatives, and the PP lodged immediate appeals against both in the Constitutional Court.\n\n'Sword of Damocles'\n\nSo the mayor of one small town in Andalusia says there has been a surge of interest in his\"express-marriage\"service for same-sex couples anxious to tie the knot as soon as possible.\n\n\"They're afraid of what the PP will do,\"Jose Antonio Rodriguez told the BBC from Jun.\n\n\"Before the election debate on TV, about 60 couples had contacted me. Now I reply to about 100 enquires a day.\"\n\nIn that TV debate, the Socialist Party candidate called on his opponent to remove\"the sword of Damocles hanging over couples' heads\"by withdrawing the Pop's appeal against the gay marriage law.\n\nMariano Rajoy responded that it is\"just a question of name\"- he prefers the term\"civil union\"- and concluded that he would\"wait for the decision of the court\".\n\nBut for those affected, the name is everything.\n\n\"It [marriage] means that all families are recognised as equal,\"argues Antonio Poveda, president of Spain's Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Transsexuals and Bisexuals (FELGTB).\n\nThat equality - including the right for gay couples to adopt - was hard-won after decades of discrimination under General Franco's dictatorship.\n\n\"There was a poll just after the transition to democracy and 85% of people thought homosexuality was an illness or should be punished. We have moved from there to having equal rights,\"Mr Poveda says.\n\nHe argues that such rights should be cherished.\n\n\"It was a great day for democracy here when the same-sex marriage law was passed. For the first time, Catholic Spain became a reference point for social rights,\"says Antonio Poveda. \n\n\"The economic crisis will pass, but the legacy this government will leave are those advances in equal rights.\"\n\nDespite its deep Catholic roots, Spain was the third country ever to legalise gay marriage. \n\nAbout 20,000 couples have wed since the civil code was changed in 2005. A 2011 survey showed that 77% support for the reform among 15- to 29-year-olds.\n\nAbortion fears\n\nBut it is not the Socialists' only major reform with an uncertain future.\n\nAt the PP victory rally on Sunday, a group of young women unfurled a long banner demanding changes to the legislation on abortion. The party counts many staunch Catholics among its supporters.\n\nA new law in 2010 allowed abortion on demand up to 14 weeks into a pregnancy. The government framed the reform in terms of the woman's right to choose. \n\nThe PP argued then for the rights of the unborn child, and it still does now.\n\nIts electoral programme talks of\"protecting and supporting\"maternity, and says it plans to alter the abortion law\"to reinforce the protection of the right to life\".\n\nThe party also opposes a new clause allowing girls of 16 or 17 to end a pregnancy without their parents' knowledge.\n\n\"When Rajoy says he wants to increase the right to life, we understand that he wants to return to the 1985 law which only allowed abortion in exceptional cases,\"says Ignacio Arsuaga of the anti-abortion campaign group Hazteoir.\n\nThen, terminations were permitted in cases of rape, foetal deformity or risk to the mother's physical or mental health.\n\nIn practice, it was relatively easy to get an abortion on mental health grounds, with minimal explanation required.\n\nSecret agenda?\n\nSupporters of the new law argue it is too soon to see its real impact. But they are sure there has been no surge in terminations.\n\n\"The number of abortions has fallen, because the crisis means there are fewer immigrant women here and because of the morning-after pill,\"argues feminist Empar Pineda. She says immigrant women accounted for 54% of abortions in Madrid. \n\n\"I think the government would find it difficult to change the law now,\"she argues.\"Spanish society has already taken it on board and they'd come under heavy criticism.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the vote, the Socialist Party campaigned with scare tactics. It warned of a secret PP agenda - not only to bring spending cuts - but to reverse its progressive reforms. \n\nOne advert made by supporters shows a female couple's marriage certificate being torn up; another has voters shouting at the PP for clarity on its plans.\n\nIn the current climate, the party will be forced to make economic recovery its priority. Less urgent - highly divisive - issues will likely be left hanging. \n\nIn the meantime, the mayor of Jun has his work cut out, marrying gay couples unwilling to take any chances.\n\n\"People have relaxed a bit, because the PP won't actually take over government until the end of December. But I'm still getting a huge number of enquiries.\"\nTL;DR: The centre-right Popular Party (PP) won Spain's general election promising to lead the country out of economic crisis and restore investor confidence in its solvency.\n\nArticle: Residents of Undercliff Drive had to evacuate their homes when the road began to collapse following heavy rain.\n\nThe authority is considering whether to build pedestrian access, a new access road to properties at the base of the cliff or a low-cost road from the west.\n\nCouncillors will decide on Tuesday whether to approve the funding.\n\nThe road, between Niton and St Lawrence, remains closed and a four-mile detour is in place.\n\nThe landslide happened during reconstruction of the road and eight families are still living in rented accommodation.\nTL;DR: Isle of Wight Council is to decide whether to allocate \u00a3500,000 to re-establish access to a road which suffered a major landslide in February.\n\nArticle: There will be  three flights daily from Belfast City  to London City Airport. \n\nThe airline says it is part of an expansion that will link the UK regions to the heart of London's financial district.  \n\nFlybe is also introducing four flights a day from Dublin to London City.

He was among 70 people arrested for similar crimes.\n\nAccording to a court ruling, Kong and his team had made a profit of 18m yuan ($2.78m; \u00a32m) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid vaccines.\n\nA batch of the fake vaccines was smuggled overseas but it was not known at the time where they had been sent to.   \n\nIn a case in Mexico last month, police arrested six people for allegedly trafficking fake Covid-19 vaccines in the northern border state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nThe suspects are said to have offered vaccines for sale for the equivalent of around $2,000 per dose at a clinic in a suburb of Monterrey.\nTL;DR: Police in China and South Africa have seized thousands of doses of counterfeit Covid-19 vaccine and made dozens of arrests, Interpol says.\n\nArticle: The retailer is also cancelling orders for its Spring and Summer clothing lines and won't pay costs towards them.\n\nNew Look told the BBC it did not take the decision lightly.\"This is a matter of survival,\"it told suppliers.\n\nOne small firm said New Look\u2019s behaviour was \u201ctotally out of order\u201d.\n\n'Challenges'\n\nThe supplier, which provides clothing for several High Street chains and did not want its name published, told the BBC it was not currently owed money by New Look and had no outstanding orders with the retailer.\n\nHowever, it added that New Look\u2019s approach would \u201cdevastate smaller companies down the supply chain at a time when they need help the most\u201d.\n\nNew Look\u2019s instructions to suppliers came in the form of a letter, signed by chief executive Nigel Oddy and dated 2 April, which has been seen by the BBC.\n\nAll New Look stores have been closed since 21 March.

If the Government decides to introduce a ban, it should explain why it has come to this decision.\"\n\nThe committee called on the Government to commission independent research to see whether energy drinks are more harmful than other soft drinks.\n\nThe MPs also supported the idea of exclusion zones of sales to children around schools. \n\nThey said that despite statutory labelling on energy drinks that they are not recommended for children,\"a significant number of young people continue to consume these products, and some in excessive amounts.\"leading to concerns that children and their parents do not fully understand what they are consuming. \n\nThe committee said the Government should use the opportunity of leaving the EU to introduce additional - more prominent - labelling requirements on energy drinks. \n\nProfessor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said it was\"disappointing not to see a recommendation today to ban the sale of these drinks to children.\n\n\"We believe that the evidence is already compelling that energy drinks bring no benefits and only harm to children.\"\n\nThe committee members said they had heard from a number of witnesses who argued that the low cost of energy drinks made them more accessible to children.\n\nProf Viner said the Government should introduce\"a minimum price for energy drinks as we know their cheap price tag is a key driver for their purchase\".\n\nThe NASUWT Teachers Union gave evidence to the enquiry. Chris Keates, general secretary said:\"Teachers and school leaders continue to see first-hand the contribution energy drinks can make to poor pupil behaviour and pupils' ability to concentrate in class.\"\n\nThe union said the voluntary bans implemented by retailers were\"helpful\"but don't go far enough, and\"a blanket ban is needed.\"\nTL;DR: Experts advising the government have said there is not enough scientific evidence to warrant a ban on the sale of energy drinks to children.\n\nArticle: By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Business Correspondent\n\nCork-based Teamwork.com said the move would protect access to the UK market if there is no free trade deal.\n\nThe company's clients include Netflix, Disney and Spotify.\n\nIt said:\"Being in Northern Ireland will ensure we can tap into the great talent pool on offer and access the UK market in the future.\"\n\nThe jobs will pay combined salaries of \u00a33.2m and Invest NI is offering \u00a3680,000 in grant support.\n\nIt is not the first company to'future-proof' its business against a no deal or hard Brexit scenario.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Almac, headquartered in Craigavon, last year bought plants in Ireland to safeguard EU market access should future regulations make trade more difficult.\n\nTeamwork.com currently employs 200 people and its Belfast office will be its largest outside Cork.\n\nFifty-five of the posts will be for developers and 30 others in technical support.\n\n\"Our software development sector has gone from strength to strength,\"said Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton.\n\n\"In the last five years, 30 companies have chosen to set up dedicated software development centres here.\"\nTL;DR: An Irish software company is opening an office in Belfast -

who is one of nine advisers to the pope, known as the C9 - met survivors of abuse and members of the global organisation Ending Clergy Abuse. \n\nHundreds of victims have protested outside the Vatican, calling for justice and zero tolerance over the issue.\n\nThe conference was called for by Pope Francis, who earlier this month admitted that abuse of nuns by members of the clergy had included sexual slavery.\n\nA Vatican spokesman later clarified his comments, advising that in using the words\"sexual slavery\"the Pope was referring to\"sexual manipulation\"as a form of sexual abuse.\n\nLast week, a former Catholic cardinal was defrocked over historical sexual abuse allegations.\n\nUpdate 6 March 2019: This article has been updated to make clear that the Vatican later clarified that the Pope had not meant to use the words\"sexual slavery\".\nTL;DR: A senior Roman Catholic Cardinal has said that files documenting child sexual abuse were destroyed, allowing offences to continue.\n\nArticle: British Heart Foundation Cymru (BHF) wants emergency life support (ELS) skills on the national curriculum, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nBHF says such a move would create a new generation of lifesavers across Wales.\n\nThe Welsh petition has collected 4,000 names since being launched in February.\n\nThe charity wants to teach children first aid skills, such as resusciation techniques, incorporating them into areas of the existing curriculum.\n\n\"If they are properly trained they are as capable as adults and by acting promptly they can prevent disabilities and help save lives,\"Delyth Lloyd, public affairs manager for BHF Cymru, told BBC Radio Wales.\n\nShe said ELS are a set of actions which can\"keep someone alive until professional help arrives\"such as CPR which can include rescue breaths and chest compressions.\n\nMs Lloyd acknowledged that while it is not currently a compulsory part of the curriculum some schools do teach ELS skills.\n\n\"We'd like to see a new generation of lifesavers across Wales with every child leaving secondary school knowing how to save a life,\"she said.\n\nAcross the UK over 100,000 people have signed the petition.\nTL;DR: A petition has been handed over to the Welsh assembly calling for first aid to be taught to all pupils in secondary schools.\n\nArticle: The decision is in protest against a European Parliament motion which called its software\"malicious\".\n\nKaspersky Lab said the accusation was\"untrue\"and demonstrated a\"distinct lack of respect\".\n\nThe row comes after the US and UK took steps to remove Kaspersky software from some government systems.\n\n'No danger'\n\nOn 13 June, the European parliament adopted a cyber-security defence motion to combat the\"unprecedented threat\"the organisation faces from state-sponsored hacking. \n\nPart of the strategy will involve a review of hardware and software used in its various institutions to find the\"potentially dangerous programmes and devices\".\n\nThe resolution, which has no legislative power, also calls for a ban on the programs and equipment\"confirmed as malicious\". It then names Kaspersky Lab and no other software firms.\n\nIn a statement, Eugene Kaspersky who founded the firm, said the statement was false and added:\"This decision from the European Parliament welcomes cybercrime in Europe.\"\n\nHe said the firm had no choice but to take\"definitive action\".\n\nThis would involve halting all collaboration with European cybercrime-fighting initiatives, including those with the Europol agency, until it gets\"official clarification\"from the European Parliament about the statement.\n\nAlso paused is Kaspersky's work with the No More Ransom project which helps victims of ransomware recover their data.\n\nIn a separate public comment, Kaspersky Lab said the June statement stood in contrast to information released in April when the Commission said it had\"no indication for any danger associated\"with Kaspersky's anti-virus software.\n\nIt added:\"Kaspersky Lab has only ever tried to rid the world of cybercrime. \n\n\"We have showed time and again that we disclose cyber-threats regardless of origin and author, even to our own detriment.\"\nTL;DR: Computer security firm Kaspersky Lab has halted all cyber-crime collaboration with European agencies and organisations.\n\nArticle: By Ed DaveyBBC News, London\n\nNewham Council hopes to secure a Treasury loan at favourable rates, allowing the club to finance a move to the stadium after the 2012 Games.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company is due to name either Tottenham Hotspur or West Ham as preferred bidder on or shortly after 28 January. The winner gets \u00a335m of state money for refurbishment.\n\nCouncillors at the Labour-run east London borough will vote on the loan at 1930 GMT.\n\nBut the BBC has uncovered aspects of the council's approach that led one financial auditor to warn of a\"danger of abuse\"of the system.\n\nThese include:\n\nAll 60 councillors in Newham are Labour Party representatives.\n\nOne serving councillor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:\"A significant number of councillors have reservations. \n\n\"There are massive doubts over supposed community benefits.\"\n\nThe councillor continued:\"Why are we arranging a loan for a private company? West Ham should go to a bank like everybody else. \n\n\"The financial football model is hardly blessed by success.\"\n\nBut not one serving politician will go on the record.\n\nThe councillor said:\"The problem is the mayoral system. \n\n\"People are frightened to go against the mayor. They are frightened of a lack of patronage. \n\n\"He's had almost the same executive since 2000 - on \u00a340,000 each. People want a bit of the action.\"\n\nAnita Shields, an auditor who works with other local authorities to ensure financial transparency, said:\"Councillors are afraid to speak out. You have people pushing to get something through quickly. \n\n\"This rings alarm bells.\"\n\nThe BBC has also learned that the mayor has declared 35 gifts from the club in the last three years.\n\nBy contrast, the leader of Islington Council declares an average of three gifts a year from Arsenal.\n\n'Drinks and hospitality'\n\nThe leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council - home to Chelsea, QPR and Fulham - declared four such gifts since 2008.\n\nIn both 2008 and 2009, almost half of the total gifts Sir Robin declared were from West Ham. \n\nThey mostly consisted of\"hospitality in the chairman' s suite\"and\"lunch and drinks\".\n\nThe mayor is a season ticket-holder at Upton Park.\n\nThe BBC understands 13 councillors left the last debate because of declared gifts. Neither they nor Sir Robin are able to vote.\n\nNewham Council says the mayor has been open about hospitality and has nothing to hide.\n\nMs Shields said:\"If you enjoy hospitality, you are not impartial. \n\n\"You become familiar. When you have familiarity you have the danger of abuse of the system.\"\n\nAnd Mike Law, a former Labour councillor who defected to the Conservatives, said:\"Elected members taking gifts from local companies then lending them money is just wrong.\"\n\nHe continued:\"No-one speaking out is par for the course. \n\n\"These councillors don't understand why they were elected. \n\n\"They are frightened because there is always the perk of being a mayor's special adviser on the horizon.\"\n\nMayor's special advisers are paid up to \u00a331,000. The council has not commented on the posts.\n\nBut Mr Law said:\"Local democracy is not working. \n\n\"Councillors are supposed to represent the electorate - yet we have the poorest in the country bailing out multi-millionaires.\n\n\"The vote is window dressing - it allows them to share blame with elected members if something goes wrong.\"\n\nNewham councillors usually receive full details of voting issues a week in advance.\n\nBut they only received the documents 48 hours in advance.\n\nAnd 10\"weighty\"background papers were withheld.\n\nCouncillors were allowed to come into Newham's headquarters to inspect them on Wednesday. \n\n'Suicidal'\n\nBut the BBC understands they could not because the person holding the documents was\"not at work\".\n\nCouncillors can view them immediately before the meeting.\n\nThey are thought to detail whether Newham Council would have to repay the \u00a340m if West Ham defaulted.\n\nThe council has refused to confirm if it will be liable.\n\nMs Shields said:\"You need complete transparency, I cannot stress that enough. Otherwise this does not have the proper agreement of the people.\n\n\"To go ahead on this basis is suicidal. Nobody is scrutinising it.\"\n\nThe council says it cannot disclose the information for\"commercial reasons\".\n\nPress and public will be barred from the vote and were also banned from a previous meeting.\n\nThe councillor who spoke to the BBC said:\"You couldn't take a \u00a32,000 car loan with the information we were given.\n\n\"We are making a \u00a340m decision with no time to scrutinise facts. \n\n\"Councillors will have minutes to read complicated documents. They'll be unable to discuss them privately.\"\n\n'Fully scrutinised'\n\nThe councillor added:\"I can't say who's liable if West Ham default - the answer is sitting in Newham's office.\"\n\nSir Robin declined to be interviewed, but a Newham Council spokesman said:\"The fact all gifts are declared and recorded shows the mayor has nothing to hide and is being totally transparent. \n\n\"The mayor paid for a season ticket and the offer of hospitality was accepted on that basis. \n\n\"West Ham United is a major employer within the borough. It is only right he be involved with them.\"\n\nHe continued:\"[The loan] would be based on scrutiny of a full business case on terms that ensures the council makes money that will be invested in the community and secures legacy benefits.\n\n\"Any loan would be made to a stadium company not West Ham. It is not funding that the council could use on other services. \n\n\"We want an occupant for the stadium that will provide jobs for local people.\"\n\nThe spokesman added:\"The reports to council contain information relating to business of the council and West Ham United. \n\n\"If this information was public it could prejudice the commercial position. \n\n\"A confidentiality agreement has been signed with the Olympic Park Legacy Company. Councillors will have an opportunity to see information before the meeting.\"\n\nWest Ham declined to comment.\nTL;DR: A \u00a340m loan being arranged by a local council to help West Ham United move into the Olympic Stadium has come under fire after a BBC London investigation raised questions over how the decision is being reached.\n\nArticle: A new study has found that marbled crayfish are multiplying rapidly and invading ecosystems across the world.\n\nThe ten-legged pests are descended from one single female with a mutation allowing it to reproduce without males.\n\nThese self-cloning ladies are found for sale in North America, despite a warning against keeping them as pets.\n\nSales of the six-inch creature are already banned by the European Union.\n\nProcambarus virginalis did not exist three decades ago. \n\nBorn to a male and female slough crayfish, a species originally from Florida, the original marbled crayfish had an additional set of chromosomes - a mutation that made her distinct from her parents and allowed her to reproduce without having to mate. \n\nNow officially a separate species, the marbled crayfish can be found in the wild in Japan, Madagascar, multiple European countries and the US. \n\nThe new study published in Nature, Ecology and Evolution describes the invasive species as a threat to wild ones, particularly seven native species in Madagascar.\n\n\"If you have one animal, essentially, three months later, you will have 200 or 300,\"Dr Wolfgang Stein, one of the researchers, told Canadian public broadcaster CBC.\n\nDr Stein, who is a neurophysiologist at Illinois State University, told the BBC that they compared 11 marbled crayfish, spread through the pet trade to four locations on three continents. \n\nHe noted that while they all share the DNA of one mother crayfish, there were some differences in\"colouring\".\n\n\"The animal sequenced here by us in the US was more blue-ish than the ones from Germany and Madagascar,\"Dr Stein said.\n\nHe believes this is where environmental influences may play a role in shaping the unique past of this freshwater crayfish's life.\"[Raised] in solitude they have a tendency to be blue\", and those socialised with others in their species tended to be more grey, he explained.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nCuriously, scientists at the German Cancer Research Centre, that led the study, may be able to better understand how cancer tumours adapt and develop resistance to drug treatments, by studying the crayfish's adaptability and ability to multiply.\n\nThe crustaceans can be bought in pet shops in North America and through online adverts.

a boy and a girl.\n\nWhile working as a welder's mate at the old Gulf oil refinery at Milford Haven in 1978 he won \u00a390,000 and a new car on a spot the ball competition and shortly after quit work to set up and run a family smallholding.\n\nBut, through a series of loss-making house moves and a gambling habit, the prosecution case was Cooper frittered the money away.\n\nCertainly by 1983 police said he had started his career in burglary that eventually led to 30 convictions, although he was linked with many more.\n\nCooper was a fisherman who enjoyed the outdoors, and the prosecution said his knowledge of the fields and paths around Milford Haven gave him free rein to target houses in the area.\n\nCooper's son told the court his father was fascinated by survival programmes on television and even kept a copy of the SAS handbook.\n\nHe would stash coins, jewellery, silverware and photograph frames under lock and key wherever the family was living at the time.\n\nIt was put to Cooper during his trial he would regularly have bonfires in his back garden on which he would burn jewellery as means of identifying any valuable stones and metal he had stolen.\n\nThe attempted robberies of five teenagers he cornered in a field near the Mount Estate in Milford Haven in March 2006 occurred at a time he was targeting homes in that area.\n\nOne of the teenagers was raped at knife point during the terrifying ordeal and another sexually assaulted.\n\nIt was an armed robbery two years later at a house in the village of Sardis that eventually led to his capture.\n\nHe was sentenced to 16 years in prison when convicted by a jury in 1998 of 30 counts of burglary and the robbery.\n\nWhile he was still behind bars for those crimes Dyfed-Powys Police started a cold case review of the double murders of the 1980s.\n\nAdvances in forensic techniques meant they were able to link items used in the Sardis robbery with the killing of the Dixons.\n\nThese included the double-barrelled shotgun used by Cooper, which was found to have a trace of Mr Dixon's blood under the paintwork Cooper had since added.\n\nShorts found in his bedroom at the time of his arrest in 1998 were also found to have Mr Dixon's DNA on them, along with that of his daughter Julie.\n\nAmong the many items Cooper had squirreled away in the hedgerows near his house at 34 St Mary's Park, Jordanston, where he lived for much of the 1980s and 90s, was a sock that belonged to Mr Thomas.\n\nOn 13 May 2009, just a few months after he was released from prison for the burglaries and robbery, Cooper was back in custody for the killing of the Thomases, the Dixons and the attack on the teenagers at the Mount Estate.\n\nAs he was led into Haverfordwest magistrates court two days later he shouted at waiting photographers and television crews:\"You must judge me after the trial and not before.\"\n\nThe jury has done just that and Cooper is now likely to be remembered as one of the most notorious killers in modern Welsh history.\nTL;DR: When John Cooper murdered brother and sister Richard and Helen Thomas at their house in Pembrokeshire in 1985 he was already a prolific burglar.\n\nArticle: The signs placed at the entrances to Redwood Primary School in Sinfin, Derby, urge adults to to\"greet your child with a smile, not a mobile\".\n\nThey have had a mostly positive response from parents, with many agreeing with the sentiment.\n\nThe school said it wanted parents and children talking and listening more to each other at home.\n\nTeachers Rachel Kirk and Sarah Chaffe produced signs for each of the school's three gates.\n\n\"What we've been trying to do is put together lots of ideas for our parents to help them be more effective when they're chatting with their children at home,\"said Ms Kirk.\n\n\"The signs are really just to remind parents how important it is to greet their children and encourage them to get into a conversation about all the fun things they have done that day.\"\n\n'Too distracted'\n\nKerri Hilton, who has two children at the school, said:\"Parents shouldn't need to be told to pay attention to their children. \n\n\"I always ask how their day was and what their favourite part of the day was.\n\n\"If you stood in the playground at home time and looked around - the amount of people on phones is shocking. It's sad to see that a phone becomes a priority over a child.\"\n\nAnother mother agreed with the signs, and said often parents were too distracted to keep an eye on their child. \n\n\"They don't know what's going off so I totally agree with it,\"said Cora Doherty. \n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Over in the Lords, there's a bit of a lull, but there are lots of second readings coming up in their Lordships' final fortnight before the summer break including bills on immigration, medicines, and constituency boundaries.\n\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead.\n\nMonday 13 July\n\nThe Commons meets (14:30) for Home Office Questions, after which, expect the usual crop of post-weekend statements and urgent questions.\n\nThe main business is the Supply and Estimates Bill, which enacts the government's spending plans - followed by the rushing through of the bill to bring in the temporary cut in stamp duty announced by the chancellor in his Summer Statement.\n\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Bob Seely, is on the pressures on independent pharmacies.\n\nWatch out, too, for the government's long-awaited motion setting the membership of Intelligence and Security Committee to allow it to start work after the longest hiatus in its history. \n\nThe motion can be debated for up to 90 minutes, which will provide plenty of opportunities to press for the publication of the long-awaited report on Russia.  \n\nThere may also be some discussion of the government decision to name the former Lord Chancellor, Chris Grayling, as the new chair, succeeding the now-departed Dominic Grieve. \n\nThe other members from the Commons will be Sir John Hayes (C), Stewart Hosie (SNP), Dame Diana Johnson (Lab), Kevan Jones (Lab), Dr Julian Lewis (C), Mark Pritchard (C) and Theresa Villiers (C). A parallel motion in the Lords will appoint their one member on Tuesday.\n\nOn the Committee Corridor, Public Accounts Committee (14:30) takes evidence on Immigration Enforcement from the top civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft and his No 2 Shona Dunn plus Tyson Hepple, the Director General of Immigration Enforcement. \n\nThe first two witnesses endured a bruising encounter with the Home Affairs Committee, a week ago, when they were quizzed about the Windrush scandal. \n\nIn the Lords, (13:00) peers question ministers on assistance to performing arts companies and venues, the situation in Libya and preventing an increase in homelessness once the pandemic ban on evictions is lifted (that one is from the Big Issue founder, Lord Bird) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and desert locusts on food security in East Africa.\n\nThe main legislative action is the Committee Stage consideration of the Business and Planning Bill, which is being rushed through to help the economy recover from the pandemic.  \n\nIt will allow pubs and restaurants to apply for licenses to sell alcohol for off-premises consumption and most of the amendments focus on tightening the system for licensing sales - for example by saying sales must stop at 11pm. \n\nAn interesting player in these debates may be the Lib Dem Baroness Thornhill, a former Mayor of Watford, who devoted considerable effort to coping with the impact of nightlife on local residents. Serious attempts to change the bill may well follow at Report Stage a week later.\n\nAficionados of the Lords committee work should keep an eye on the Lords Liaison Committee (10:45) which will be hearing bids from a series of peers for subjects for the next set of special inquiry committees.\n\nTuesday 14 July\n\nMPs begin their day (11:30) with Justice Questions. \n\nThe Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour MP Liz Twist calls for a review of the Disabled Facilities Grants system - which offers a means-tested grant of up to \u00a330,000 for people with a permanent disability to make changes to their home - a walk-in shower or  a stair lift, for example - to help them to continue living there.\n\nThen MPs polish off the Parliamentary Constituencies Bill - which now does not reduce their numbers to 600, but which does bring in a strict population quota to equalise the number of voters in constituencies. \n\nThe Conservatives will say it irons out a serious unfairness in the electoral system, while Labour will argue that more needs to be done to register voters, particularly in the inner cities. \n\nThe adjournment debate, led by Labour MP Rushanara Ali, is on funding for the removal of flammable cladding, \n\nMy committee pick is the Defence Committee hearing (14.30) on the UK and Defence's preparations for pandemics, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and government's adaptations of plans in response to Covid-19, the Armed Forces and MoD's contribution, as well as what lessons should be learned. \n\nThey will hear from three expert witnesses: Professor David Alexander, professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College London, Dr Jennifer Cole, research fellow in antimicrobial resistance at Royal Holloway, and Bruce Mann, who was director of the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office. \n\nElsewhere, the Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union (10:00) has an evidence session on the progress of the negotiations on the UK's Future Relationship with the EU - and on another Brexit-related matter, watch out for the publication of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report, Unfettered Access: Northern Ireland and customs arrangements after Brexit  - and any follow-up to that in the chamber.\n\nIn the Lords (12:00) questions range across recognising Taiwan as an independent sovereign state, ensuring that a COVID-19 vaccine is available affordable and clauses protecting human rights and maintaining environmental standards in post-Brexit trade agreements.  \n\nThen peers continue grinding through the detail of the Agriculture Bill, with day three of Committee Stage consideration. \n\nThis is going rather slowly - originally it had been scheduled for four days in committee, but two extra days have now been added to the calendar, which, in turn, will probably mean an extra day of Report Stage consideration.  \n\nThere is also a motion to appoint the former Home Office Minister and security advisor to Gordon Brown, Lord West of Spithead, as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee.\n\nWednesday 15 July\n\nThe Commons kicks off (11:30) with half an hour of International Development Questions - which might be rather a mournful occasion as it will probably be the last such question time, with the Department for International Development (DfID) due to be absorbed into the Foreign Office in September. \n\nSo the demeanour of Secretary of State Anne-Marie Trevelyan will be worth watching. And then it's Prime Minister's Question Time\n\nThe day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is on Tree-Lined Streets - with the Conservative, Chris Clarkson, seeking to place a requirement on major new developments to ensure streets are lined with trees. On the argument that greenery in the urban environment has a positive impact on mental and our physical health, and that street trees are associated with cleaner air, more physical activity and improved health and well-being.\n\nThe main debate will be on an Opposition Day motion from the SNP - at the time of writing they're being coy about the subject. \n\nOn the committee corridor, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will field questions from the Treasury Committee about his Summer Statement (14:30). \n\nElsewhere, Northern Ireland Affairs takes evidence on the Legacy of Northern Ireland's past: The UK Government's New Proposals (09:30); Work and Pensions quiz the Welfare Delivery Minister, Will Quince on the wait for a first Universal Credit payment (09:30); Transport (09:30) continues its look at the issues around e-scooters with technology companies and Transport minister Rachel MacLean; International Trade Committee (14:30) takes evidence on UK Freeports and Women and Equalities (14:30) have a panel of ministers before them in their inquiry, Unequal impact? Coronavirus and BAME people - Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, Public Health minister Jo Churchill, and Housing Minister Chris Pincher round off the evidence-taking.\n\nIn the Lords (12.00) question time ranges across the number of children living in poverty in working households, the announcement of the chair, timings and terms of reference of the Royal Commission on criminal justice and racism within the Metropolitan Police. \n\nThen peers rattle through a series of legislative chores, starting with the Third Reading Pension Schemes Bill, which should be a brief rubber-stamping. \n\nNext comes the Enterprise Act 2002 (Specification of Additional Section 58 Consideration) Order which aims to ensure that critical UK public health and crisis mitigation capabilities, are not lost in takeovers and mergers with foreign companies and that will be debated together with the Enterprise Act 2002 (Share of Supply) (Amendment) Order 2020 which increases the government's powers to scrutinise mergers in sensitive sectors of the economy artificial intelligence, cryptographic authentication technology and advanced materials. \n\nPeers will also scrutinise the Competition Appeal Tribunal (Coronavirus) (Recording and Broadcasting) Order 2020 - which will allow Competition Appeal Tribunal hearings to be broadcast by video. \n\nAnd, finally they will approve a motion to seek Royal Assent for a Church of England measure transferring Episcopal oversight of Channel Islands to the see of Salisbury. \n\nFormerly in Winchester, temporarily in Canterbury, Salisbury is intended to be their long-term harbour. The move was agreed by the General Synod in February.\n\nThursday 16 July\n\nMPs begin their day (09:30) with questions to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office (aka Michael Gove), followed by the weekly Commons business statement from the Leader of the House. \n\nUnusually for a Thursday, but probably briefly, there's a Second Reading debate on the Non-domestic Rating (Public Lavatories) Bill, a technical tidying-up measure that probably won't detain MPs for long. \n\nBut then they more to a general debate on the multi-billion pound plan to revamp the Victorian home of Parliament, known in Westminster as\"Restoration and Renewal,\"or R&R for short. \n\nAs things stand, MPs have agreed that they will move out of their Victorian-gothic part of the parliamentary estate for several years, while essential work is completed and have set up a delivery authority set up to oversee the project. \n\nThe reasoning is that it is impossible to complete the necessary comprehensive work to replace crumbling stonework, out of date wiring and failing services with MPs and Lords still in residence - not least because of the dangers posed by asbestos. \n\nThe plan is based on the view that the building cannot practically be renovated in sections, so MPs will be relocated to a new temporary chamber and offices located on the site of Richmond House, the former home of the Department of Health, which would mostly be demolished and rebuilt. \n\nBut a number of MPs have never been reconciled to this decision - the Leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg is a sceptic - and this debate looks like their fightback. \n\nLeading the charge, the ex-minister Sir Edward Leigh, who argues that the Chamber of the Lords could be kept going, thus eliminating the need for a temporary chamber, and the whole exercise could then be accomplished at a much lower cost.\n\nWhat the debate will illustrate is the difficulty of routing an intricate multi-billion pound restoration of a world heritage building through the Byzantine internal structures of Parliament.\n\nTheoretically this is a\"house matter,\"concerning the running of the Commons and Lords, but given the several billion pounds involved, the government has a stake as well, and there are suggestions that Downing Street is jittery about the cost. \n\nA possible final bill of \u00a34bn is often quoted, but this is a ballpark estimate made several years ago; no-one can really be sure. \n\nTwo past Leaders of the House, Andrea Leadsom and Chris Grayling are backing the original scheme - and its supporters point to the current need to maintain a 24-hour seven-day-a-week fire patrol, recent incidents where chunks of masonry have fallen off the building, mercifully without hitting anyone, and the malodorous miasma emanating from the Victorian lavatories. \n\nThey, and other key figures like Meg Hillier, the Labour ex-minister who now chairs the Public Accounts Committee, argue that it would be more costly and outright dangerous to attempt the restoration work with the parliamentarians in situ. \n\nIt is an interesting question who would be liable if someone was hurt in any future masonry fall. The general debate will demonstrate whether or not there is any momentum behind a change in policy. \n\nOn the Committee Corridor, Environmental Audit (14:30) focuses on electronic Waste and the Circular Economy - and are lining up witnesses from Samsung, Fairphone, Beko, Amazon, DixonsCarphone and TechBuyer and International Development (14:30) hear from expert witnesses about sexual exploitation and abuse in the aid sector\n\nIn the Lords (12:00) ministers face questions on the impact of digital platforms on the functioning of democracy, the recommendations of the Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody on prisoners' experience under COVID-19' and the impact of the pandemic on human trafficking. Then it's back to the detail of the Agriculture Bill, with day four of Committee Stage.\n\nFriday 17 July\n\nThe Commons is not sitting, but the Lords is planning to sit on Fridays more frequently, and meets (11:00) to dispose of the Finance Bill - because this is a money bill, where the Commons reigns supreme, peers are not allowed to interfere.\n\nTherefore they will take the Second Reading, Committee, Report and Third Reading stages in a single gulp but perhaps with a few interesting thoughts from the phalanx of ex-Chancellors and other experts on the red benches (Lord Lamont is already listed to speak). There may be further business scheduled as well\n\nThe Lords Science and Technology Committee (15:00) will be quizzing the government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Chris Whitty on the science of COVID-19.\nTL;DR: It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again in the Commons, as MPs prepare for another round of debate on whether or not they should move out of their Victorian home, to make way for a multi-billion pound restoration project.\n\nArticle: Mark Cheetham, of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said the new centre could lead to fewer orthopaedic surgery cancellations. \n\nMr Cheetham, the trust's care group medical director, said cancellations occurred\"too frequently\"because of others needing emergency treatment.\n\nThe sustainability and transformation plan has been criticised by NHS bosses.\n\nThe NHS Future Fit programme was launched in 2014 to review the health system across Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and mid-Wales and reorganise services. \n\nShropshire's health chiefs say the review is necessary because demand on services is rising and\"outstrips\"available funding, putting pressure on all services. \n\nMr Cheetham said it could lead to an\"opportunity\"to develop a specialist orthopaedic centre which would lead to fewer cancellations as such patients were currently\"mixed in with emergency patients\".\n\n\"Most patients having orthopaedic surgery don't need access to critical care, what they do need is access to a bed in an orthopaedic ward,\"he said. \n\nIn December, a leaked letter from NHS England to the trust's chief executive Simon Wright said it had\"little confidence\"in the proposals. The NHS bosses said millions of pounds of funding may not be available and asked for a revised scheme to be submitted.\n\nHowever, Mr Wright said the plan was still a\"working document\".\nTL;DR: A hospital consultant says a proposed shake-up of health services could see a specialist orthopaedic centre created.\n\nArticle: By Owain ClarkeBBC Wales health correspondent\n\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething is setting up a taskforce after a review of amber response times. \n\nHe said he was\"increasingly concerned\"and would not rule out fines among a\"range of options\"to improve things. \n\nThere were 79,150 wasted hours - the equivalent of nine years - last year for crews waiting outside A&E.\n\nThe bulk of 999 calls are ranked as amber and ambulances have been taking longer to reach these patients.\n\nThere is a 15 minute quality target for how long ambulances should be waiting outside hospitals. Anything beyond this counts as a handover delay. \n\nThe number of patients delayed in this way in November 2019 was 513 - the highest number since March 2016.\n\nMr Gething said in a written statement to assembly members:\"As an immediate step, I have asked officials to develop proposals for a system of incentives to achieve desired improvements. \n\n\"I expect to take a decision within the next couple of weeks to enable the new system to be introduced in time to impact on performance this winter.\n\n\"This will be one element of a broader approach to incentives that will in due course focus on other parts of the urgent and emergency care system to drive improved performance.\"\n\nHe told BBC Wales he had an open mind about a potential sanction and would not rule out fines among a\"range of options\".\n\nHow is the ambulance service performing?\n\nFreeing up ambulances as fast as possible is seen as vital when it is set against a background of the rise in the number of emergency calls - about 40,000 a month.\n\nLast month, ministers said it was\"disappointing\"to see the target for red ambulance calls missed for the first time.  In November, 61.4% of ambulances arrived at life-critical calls within eight minutes; the target is 65%.\n\nBut the Welsh Government said the average response in this category remained at six minutes and 39 seconds and 73% of patients received a response within 10 minutes.\n\nAbout 70% of emergency calls are amber, these can include people with chest pains or strokes. \n\nAccording to the latest set of figures, 43.3% were responded to within 30 minutes. But the median (middle of the range) response time for amber calls has been steadily rising and is now more than 30 minutes.\n\nMr Gething believes ambulance availability is\"the single main determinant for the timeliness of amber response\". \n\nHe also highlighted the demands the ambulance service faced during the Christmas and new year period:\n\nJason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said he would welcome any action which was\"proportionate and necessary\".\n\nHe added:\"Less serious patients have been waiting longer than we'd want. We'd welcome any action and incentives put into the system, to encourage us to hand over patients more quickly.\"\n\n'The pressure's on every day'\n\nWayne Davies has been a paramedic in north east Wales since 2004. He also has a senior role which helps decide which ambulances to free up at hospitals.\n\nHis rapid response vehicle deals with red emergency calls as well as amber calls. He can assess patients and decide whether they need help at the scene or should be taken to hospital.\n\n\"The pressure's on every day, seven days a week. It can vary quite dramatically,\"he said. \n\n\"It can be very frustrating - having seven vehicles outside emergency departments and unable to offload means we can't get to patients [back] in the community as quickly as we'd like to.\"\n\nUsing a GP in the emergency contact centre means they can help deal with calls on the phone. \n\nOne amber call we saw was Hayley, who had passed out unconscious at home in Prestatyn after an asthma attack. She had already been in hospital at the weekend and was on antibiotics and steroids.\n\nThe contact centre GP assessed her over the phone before Wayne was sent to check on her. He then arranged an emergency appointment with her own GP - as she faced a wait in the surgery.\n\n\"The doctor [on the phone] was very good, very thorough,\"said Hayley. \n\n\"They told me they were going to send the paramedics - it wasn't worth them sending the ambulance and me having to wait in A&E for such a long time. I feel like I've had very good care today. \n\n\"We could see the pressure in A&E the other day. There were no beds - I was talking to lady with a chest infection who'd been there since 7am and she got a bed about 11:30 on the Saturday night.\"\n\nWayne said:\"At this time of year, there's lots of cold and flu and the cold weather has an effect - on the elderly, the young and people with chronic illnesses. \n\n\"There's been a significant increase in demand across the board, extending from winter pressures, population becomes elderly, plus new builds and a transient population coming into the area.\"\n\n'The highest I've seen is 26 calls waiting'\n\nGill Pleming, a manager at the emergency call centre in Llanfairfechan, Conwy county, has been with the ambulance service for 35 years and worked as both a paramedic and call handler. \n\n\"Demand is unprecedented, I would say, to what it was back then, when people tended to go to their local GP with ailments,\"she said. \n\n\"When I was taking calls we might take 20 in a shift. Now we're taking 80 or 90.\"\n\nCall handler Cerys Owen added:\"The highest I've seen is 26 calls waiting, that's across Wales.\"\n\nThey have noticed a spike in red calls - this can mean patients waiting longer for amber or green category calls.\n\nGill said there could be frustration for everyone at the stack of calls waiting to be dealt with - but everyone calling 999 would be able to speak to a nurse or clinician.\n\n\"We will ring them back after a time to tell them we still have their call and we haven't forgotten about them,\"she said.\n\n\"We also have to manage expectations - and will tell them if we might not get to them for an hour or two, whatever the timeframe is.\"\nTL;DR: Health boards could face fines for failing to tackle issues around the amount of time it takes ambulances to hand over patients to A&E departments.\n\nArticle: The residents\n\nIn 2007, Tesco proposed an 80,000 sq ft store on the site of an old Thorntons chocolate factory in Belper, Derbyshire.\n\nA group of residents decided to get together to campaign against the store and created the Belper Against Tesco Superstore (BATS) group.\n\nTesco owns the land, which is near the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, but has yet to submit a planning application to build the superstore.\n\nAndy Minion, spokesman for the group, said the town already had three supermarkets and feared another one, on the edge of Belper, would encourage shoppers away from the high street.\n\n\"We have a number of Tescos... in Heanor, Alfreton - they are both edge of town developments,\"he said.\n\n\"You look at what was once a perfectly OK high street in the town and the shutters have gone up, they are full of charity shops and empty units.\"\n\nHowever not everyone is against the Tesco development. A Facebook group called Belper for Tesco has 600 members. \n\nOne member, Deborah Sanders, said:\"I thought Belper was trying to move forward and having Tesco and other shops is the only way.\"\n\nPlans for a new Sainsbury's in the market town of Louth, in Lincolnshire, were turned down by East Lindsay District Council in December 2009.\n\nKeep Louth Special, a group set up in 2008 to campaign against the council selling the town's cattle market to the highest bidder, which it feared would be a supermarket chain, spoke against Sainsbury's plans.\n\nAlan Mumby, chairman of Keep Louth Special, said the group was not\"anti-supermarket\"but wanted to protect Louth's high street and its independent traders.\n\n\"There are too many instances all over the country where town centres have died,\"he said.\n\nThe farmers\n\nAndy Bloor, 57, runs a 310-acre dairy farm in Dutton, Cheshire, which supplies 1.5m litres of milk to Tesco each year.\n\nHe is chairman of the 800-strong Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group, which was formed four years ago to ensure farmers received a price for their milk which covered production costs.\n\nHe said Tesco provided him with a rolling 12-month contract and paid enough to ensure he could invest in his business.\n\n\"We are getting a better price and we have confidence that if we invest they [Tesco] will still be in the market for our milk,\"he said.\n\n\"With any business, you cannot just stand still because costs are going up. If you do not re-invest and improve we will end up going backwards and slowly the wheels of the business will come off.\"\n\nHe said the price was constantly reviewed and would be looked at again in January.\n\nDavid Handley, chairman of UK campaign group Farmers for Action, feels differently about supermarkets. He blames them for the decline of the British agricultural industry.\n\nThe dairy farmer said they were ignoring their corporate responsibility by not fairly paying farmers for their produce, which was putting many out of business.\n\n\"The dairy industry has shrunk by nearly 50% in eight years, the pig industry in the UK is virtually decimated,\"he said.\n\n\"Fruit and veg growers are getting less and less.\n\n\"As we get less and less home-produced food the pressure comes on where it's going to come from.\"\n\nHe said farming had declined since the mid-1990s, which he said was the last time farmers could earn a decent living.\n\n\"Multi-national retailers of the likes of Tesco, Walmart [which owns Asda], I hold them totally to blame for this,\"he said.\n\n\"They are the ones that control the purse strings in the supply chain.\"\n\nTesco said it had local buying teams dedicated to working with small, regional suppliers to sell local produce in stores.\n\nThe union\n\nThe growth in the big four supermarket companies is welcome news for the union which represents many of their employees.\n\nUsdaw, which has nearly 400,000 members ranging from check-out staff to supermarket section managers, says it has seen people who had given up all hope of ever working again have their fortunes reversed by a new store opening in their town.\n\nJohn Hannett, the union's general secretary, said:\"A lot of the supermarkets that have opened (have been) in areas that are run down and there are people who are long-term unemployed, including many with learning difficulties, who have been given opportunities they would never have been given.\n\n\"You can imagine how important these jobs are in these times.\n\n\"If you go into some of the areas that I've been to where people have located supermarkets they've been scarred by long-term unemployment. The idea of an interview alone was daunting and all of a sudden they're being viewed as somebody with something to offer.\"\n\nThe union believes further expansion by the big four should be encouraged.\n\n\"There are areas where planning permission is rejected or there's strong local community opposition [but] when these stores open you often find the reaction that was there dies down,\"Mr Hannett said.\n\n\"From my perspective if it brings good jobs and keeps people employed, at the end of the day that's what people want. We can only see a positive developing out of this, especially in those kind of communities where there really are no prospects for people.\"\n\nThe retail sector\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) says in the past 10 years the year that saw the biggest growth in supermarkets was 2001.\n\nIt says expansion among the big four is driven by customers, not corporate greed.\n\nBRC spokesman Richard Dodd said:\"If you look at the figures for the last 10 years from 2000 to now, in fact overall grocery space rose each year by between one and two per cent which is obviously very low growth.\n\n\"[It is] modest growth and actually surprisingly consistent over the years.\n\n\"Anyone who is saying supermarkets are actually growing more rapidly than ever is actually wrong.\n\n\"Why is supermarket floor space growing at all? The answer is all of this is driven by customers. The people who have the power in retailing are the customers.\"\n\nThe BRC, which represents the top nine biggest food retailers, says local opposition to new supermarket developments usually evaporates when the new store opens and customers flock through the doors.\n\n\"Quite often there's a small but vocal minority who make their feelings very well known and usually generate some publicity and they come out with all these lines about it's not wanted here and it's going to kill the high street,\"Mr Dodd said.\n\n\"The supermarkets have got long experience about where would be an appropriate place to open a store. The retailers generally get these judgements right.\n\n\"Most of the store opening that is going on now either is the convenience store or it's about bringing the particular name to an area where it's under-represented at the moment.\n\n\"If customers genuinely don't want the store they won't use it and it won't last five minutes.\"\nTL;DR: Residents living near supermarket developments, farmers supplying the stores and bodies representing workers and the retail industry reveal how they feel about the expansion of the so-called 'big four' - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. \n\n\n\nArticle: Mia Ayliffe-Chung, from Derbyshire, was attacked at a hostel in Queensland by a man allegedly shouting\"Allahu Akbar\", Arabic for God is great.\n\nThe 20-year-old's family said she was\"a rare person who saw beyond race, creed and belief\".\n\nThey said she would not have wanted to be the reason for\"any hostilities\".\n\nPolice are treating the incident as murder, not a terror attack.\n\nThe statement, on behalf of Mia's mother Rosie Ayliffe, was read out by her partner Stewart Cormack.\n\nSpeaking from Cromford in Derbyshire, Mr Cormack said:\"Mia was full of the kind of open-minded compassion for life that you don't see that often.

I was taken to the recovery ward then back to my room where the nurses checked on me constantly. \n\n\"The option was always there to stay if I had to but I had a lunch, we sorted the medication and I was up pretty quickly on my feet.\n\n\"There was no struggle or discomfort. I walked out on crutches and was home in time for tea.\"\n\nThe combination of local anaesthetic, patient education and\"prehabilitation\"with physiotherapy and occupational therapy on the day of surgery means suitable patients can safely go home a few hours after surgery - no matter where they live.\n\nMs Collatin's operation was carried out at the Golden Jubilee Hospital, which is leading the post-Covid charge to ease waiting lists at health boards across the country.\n\nThe hospital does not take Covid patients and is set up to almost pre-pandemic service levels. \n\nOrthopaedic surgeon Christopher Gee says it is now full steam ahead.\n\n\"Now we are really back to where we were before - we had five elective orthopaedic theatres before lockdown and that's what we have now,\"he said.\n\n\"The number of cases we are doing per list is essentially the same.

She feared her painful sinus issues would have to wait, but an urgent referral from an ENT consultant saw her receive a CT scan within three weeks. \n\nShe said:\"If this hadn't been here I would probably be here in another six months because we don't know how Covid is affecting things in hospitals and clinic.\n\n\"Within two weeks I got a call from Louisa Jordan and I am here within a week.

Any with worrying results would be referred for more testing and treatment as necessary.\n\nCurrently, women aged 25-49 are invited for cervical screening every three years, dropping to every five years between the ages of 50 and 64. \n\nThis means the average woman will undergo around 12 conventional smears in a lifetime. \n\nProfessor Sasieni says it is not that the old method is bad, more that it is now outdated and involves testing women many more times than necessary.\n\nData suggests one in five women do not turn up to have smears when invited. \n\nProfessor Sasieni says if HPV testing were to be rolled out from next year, it could be used nationally by 2015.\n\n\"With continued high coverage of HPV vaccination and targeting of screening resources towards unvaccinated women, cervical cancer should become a truly rare disease. \n\n\"And if the government plan for this change now, they could save hundreds of millions of pounds in the long run,\"he said. \n\nIn the UK, girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the HPV vaccine that protects against two strains of HPV, types 16 and 18. Girls have three injections over six months, given by a nurse.\n\nUptake in English schools has reached about 80% and in Scotland 90%.\n\nDr Lesley Walker, Cancer Research UK's director of cancer information, said the very high uptake of the vaccine in the UK had been a real success story.\n\n\"This is exciting and poses interesting questions for the screening programme in terms of the best way to screen women in the future who have been vaccinated.\n\n\"But for now it remains vitally important that all women continue to take up the invitation to go for screening when they receive it.\"\n\nMore than 2,800 women a year in the UK are diagnosed with cervical cancer and almost 1,000 die from it every year.\n\nProfessor Julietta Patnick, Director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, said they were looking at how best to incorporate HPV testing into their current screening programme. \n\n\"Any plans to use HPV testing as a primary screening method will require rigorous investigation and testing, as well as the development of robust quality assurance protocols and standards, before it could be implemented.\"\nTL;DR: Women would need far fewer smears if the NHS switched to a new way of screening for cervical cancer, a Cancer Research UK scientist has said.\n\nArticle: \"The current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format,\"Apple said in a statement.\n\nThe June conference is often used to announce new products and software features.\n\nOnly open to Apple software developers, the $1,600 (\u00a31,280) tickets sell out every year.\n\nApple said it\"will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June...[in] an entirely new online format\".\n\nFull details will follow in the coming weeks, but Phil Schiller, the company's marketing chief, promised\"a full programme with an online keynote and sessions\".\n\nThe company will also put $1m (\u00a3800,000) towards local organisations in San Jose, California,\"to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format\".\n\nThe annual keynote speech from CEO Tim Cook is usually streamed online each year anyway, to a much larger audience than the one in the convention centre in San Jose.\n\nThere had been widespread speculation about the fate of the conference as the world battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Mr Mahathir will become the oldest elected leader in the world.\n\nA government spokesman later declared nationwide public holidays for Thursday and Friday.\n\nWith only a few seats left to count, official results showed Mr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan alliance, along with an ally in Sabah state, Borneo, had won 115 seats with BN on 79 seats.\n\nOpposition supporters poured on to the streets in celebration as the results became clear.\n\nThe campaign pitted Mr Mahathir's opposition group against the BN, led by incumbent Prime Minister Najib Razak. \n\nThe BN and its major party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), have dominated Malaysian politics since the country won independence from Britain in 1957, but the once-powerful coalition has seen its popularity decline in recent years.\n\nIn the previous election, in 2013, the opposition made unprecedented gains, winning the popular vote, but it failed to win enough seats to form a government.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was sentenced to five years jail on sodomy charges, which he said were part of a political smear campaign.  \n\nMr Mahathir, who was once an integral part of BN and a mentor to Mr Najib, abandoned the coalition in 2016. \n\nAs he left, he said he was\"embarrassed\"to be associated with a party\"that is seen as supporting corruption\".   \n\nMr Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal, which saw him accused of pocketing some $700m from the 1Malaysian Development Berhad, a state investment fund. He has vehemently denied all allegations and been cleared by Malaysian authorities.\n\nThe fund is still being investigated by several countries and Mr Najib has been accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials. \n\nThe government recently passed a law redrawing election boundaries, leading to accusations that it had gerrymandered constituencies to ensure they were filled by Malay Muslims, who are traditionally BN supporters. \n\nIn the days before the poll, election reform group Bersih 2.0 accused the Election Commission (EC) of multiple\"electoral crimes\", including irregularities in postal voting and failing to remove dead people from the electoral roll.\n\nA controversial fake news law was also recently introduced, which critics say could be used by the authorities to muffle dissent. \n\nMr Mahathir is himself being investigated under that law after alleging that his plane had been sabotaged. \n\nThe government had insisted the election would be free and fair, with Mr Najib saying that the EC acted\"for the good of all\".\n\nVoters were electing 222 members of parliament as well as state assembly members in 12 of the 13 states.\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where the party that gets the most seats in parliament wins even if it does not win the popular vote.\nTL;DR: Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has scored a historic victory in the general election.\n\nArticle: By Lucy AdamsPolitical Correspondent\n\nA woman in Scotland has told how her parents paid a gang to trace her.\n\nMariam - not her real name - says the only reason she was not killed was her family did not want blood on their hands.\n\nA record 83 honour-based violence cases were referred to Police Scotland in the past year.\n\nDiana Nammi, head of the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation, said:\"Victims live in constant fear.\n\n\"Families pay bounty hunters. It means you never know who the perpetrator is.\n\n\"We have cases where the family paid more than \u00a3100,000 to track someone down and kill them.\"\n\nAn estimated 8,000 women in the UK are forced into marriage each year.\n\nThe Police Scotland figures, seen by the BBC, are the first ever produced in this country.\n\nIn April alone this year, there were nine cases.\n\nOne support agency said its cases had doubled in the past year.\n\n'Retrograde step'\n\nThe UK law to criminalise forced marriage comes into force on Monday 16 June.\n\nBut some lawyers and specialist agencies in Scotland have warned they believe this will drive victims underground. \n\n\"This is a retrograde step,\"said John Fotheringham, family law expert at BTO solicitors.\n\n\"It will dissuade victims from coming forward because it means criminalising your family.\n\n\"The Scottish government had no choice because the UK government signed the Istanbul Convention which meant forced marriage had to be criminalised across the whole of the UK.\"\n\nOthers, including the Scottish government, believe this will send out a strong message and help change attitudes.\n\nScotland already has civil orders to prevent forced marriage and protect victims, introduced and widely welcomed in 2011. Breaching such an order is a criminal offence.\n\nPolice say that the criminalisation will send out a strong deterrent message.\n\nDet Supt Willie Guild, of Police Scotland, said:\"Our top priority is the safety of the individual. \n\n\"We're working closely with the procurators fiscal to ensure victims' views and concerns are taken into consideration. \n\n'Lagging behind'\n\n\"We're aware of concerns and we're working closely with support agencies.\n\n\"However, our view is that this will send out a clear message that forced marriage is unacceptable.\"\n\nGirijamba Polubothu, manager at Shakti Women's Aid in Edinburgh, said she fears Scotland does not yet have the support or specialist accommodation in place to criminalise forced marriage and warned that it will drive victims underground.\n\nShe added:\"For some, the family members find there is no need for bounty hunters. \n\n\"Sometimes after six months, because there is a lack of support services, the victim goes back. They cannot cope with life.\n\n\"They have been in a golden cage and find that they don't know how to make breakfast or lunch.\"\n\nSupport agencies say the problem is getting worse and more women are coming forward because of growing awareness.\n\nJasvinder Sanghera, the founder of specialist UK agency Karma Nirvana, believes Scotland is lagging behind the rest of the UK.\n\nShe told the BBC:\"What I notice about Scotland is that, although it will criminalise forced marriage, there isn't the same level of awareness as in England and Wales.\n\n\"There isn't that strategy that we have. Are they ready for this? Are staff trained? \n\nVulnerable people\n\n\"The calls that we get to our helpline in England from Scotland reveal that their access to support is very poor.\n\n\"And, sadly, there are real risk issues as well because of the lack of awareness and understanding.\n\n\"Scotland really needs to be thinking about how it's going to deal with victims and survivors.\"\n\nCabinet Secretary for Equalities, Shona Robison, said:\"Criminalising forced marriage gives an additional layer of protection for some of our most vulnerable people.\n\n\"It demonstrates that we are meeting our international obligations and ensures consistency of protection across the UK.\n\n\"This not only sends a strong message to victims but also to countries where forced marriage is prevalent and where there is a lack of a domestic legal infrastructure to protect women and girls.\"\n\nShe added:\"There is no current evidence that criminalising forced marriage will dissuade victims from reporting it.\n\n\"In fact, knowing that perpetrators face a significant sanction should be empowering to victims and encourage them to seek help. \n\n\"The Scottish government provides funding to a range of organisations who can provide services including specialist support to people who are victims of forced marriage.\n\n\"We recognise that families using bounty hunters is a potential risk and that's why safety planning is a central part of all agencies' responses to forced marriage.\"\nTL;DR: Families are hiring bounty hunters to track down the victims of forced marriage who try to  run away, the BBC has learned.\n\nArticle: Siti Aisyah, 26, says she was told to sneak up behind people in airports and wipe baby lotion on their faces.\n\nMr Kim died last February at Kuala Lumpur airport after highly toxic VX nerve agent was rubbed on his face.\n\nMs Aisyah and her co-defendant Doan Thi Huong have pleaded not guilty to murder and say they were tricked.\n\nDefence lawyers say the pair had been paid to take part in similar pranks at airports, hotels and shopping malls in the days before Mr Kim's death.\n\nA lawyer representing Ms Aisyah told the court in Malaysia that she had been paid 4,000 Malaysian ringgit (\u00a3730, $1,020) by a North Korean to fly to Macau where Mr Kim was reportedly living in self-imposed exile.\n\nHe said the trip was arranged so she could play pranks for a reality TV programme, but it was cancelled for unspecified reasons.\n\nMs Aisyah sent a text message five days before Mr Kim's death telling a friend she was going to Macau for\"shooting\", police say.\n\nPyongyang has denied any involvement in the 13 February killing, but four men - believed to be North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the murder - have also been charged in the case.\n\nCCTV footage from the departure lounge of the airport shows two women approach Mr Kim before placing something over his face. \n\nThey are being watched by a group of seated North Korean men, thought to have been their\"handlers\", who subsequently boarded flights to various destinations.\n\nBut Ms Aisyah and Ms Huong were quickly arrested.

The last thing this region needs is more Iranian weapons,\"said Brian Hook, President Donald Trump's special representative on Iran during a joint press conference in Saudi Arabia. Mr Hook stood alongside Adel Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs.\n\nParts of what were said to be missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen were laid out behind them. Nearly 400 missiles and rockets have been fired from Yemen into Saudi Arabia, said Mr Hook, adding that this would not have been possible without assistance from Iran.\n\nThe joint press conference made no mention of the \u00a35.3bn ($6.5bn) worth of arms reportedly sold by the UK to Saudi Arabia since the Yemen war accelerated in March 2015, nor of the large number of Yemeni civilians killed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, drawing widespread international criticism.\n\nThe US has been, for many years now, the largest supplier of weapons to the Gulf region but Iran has managed to defy stringent sanctions by exporting both military hardware and advisers to its proxies in the region, notably Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\n\"We call on the UN Security Council to extend the arms embargo on Iran,\"said the US envoy, warning that if the embargo were allowed to lapse then Iran would be able to export\"battle tanks, artillery, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, drones and missile systems to its proxies\", as well as upgrading the range and lethality of its weapons systems and posing what he said would be an even greater threat to shipping in the region. \n\n\"No leader I have spoken to thinks this is a good idea.\"\n\nA recent study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) concluded that despite being under sanctions Iran had succeeded in gaining the strategic advantage over its rival, Saudi Arabia. \n\nThe disparity in wealth between the two countries is enormous, with the richer Saudis expending billions of dollars on expensive and sophisticated state-of-the-art weaponry. Yet none of this was able to prevent a devastatingly effective missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabia's critical oil infrastructure last September. In the space of just a few minutes a flurry of missiles fired under cover of darkness temporarily took out half of Saudi oil exports. \n\n\"These missiles were Iranian,\"declared Adel Jubeir today.\"They came from the north.\"\n\nThe attack was a wake-up call to the Saudi government that US-supplied air defences could not necessarily protect the country from a concerted\"swarm\"attack by low-tech weapons. It also helped prompt a Saudi realisation that its military campaign in Yemen was probably unwinnable and that a political solution to that war was the only way to end it. \n\nWhile the Saudis and their Western allies have supported the UN-recognised Yemen government-in-exile, Iran has supplied weaponry and advice to the Houthi rebels who still control most of the more populated areas. Aid agencies have warned of a looming catastrophe if the conflict continues.\n\nOn Tuesday, said Mr Hook, UN experts will present their findings to the UN Security Council. He said Iran had committed numerous violations of multiple UN arms embargos.\"If this is what Iran is doing now,\"said the US envoy,\"imagine what they will do if restrictions are lifted?\"\n\nThe BBC has asked the Iranian government for comment.\nTL;DR: The US and Saudi governments have made a joint public appeal to the UN Security Council to extend the 13-year old arms embargo on Iran or risk a renewed arms race in the Middle East.\n\nArticle: The blaze broke out on the ground floor of the home in Halton Brook in Runcorn, Cheshire.\n\nFirefighters said no people were harmed but two cats were pulled from the building and treated with special oxygen masks for pets.\n\nThe cats were taken to a vet following Saturday's rescue where they were said to be recovering well, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service added. \n\nIn a post on the Runcorn Fire Station Facebook page, the service thanked the non-profit organisation Smokey Paws for providing the equipment and Willows Veterinary Group for providing the training. \n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

It was never my intention to have that.\"\n\nMs Veselnitskaya said the meeting was set up by a man she did not know who told her by telephone to go to Trump Tower.\n\nMr Trump Jr asked her just one question during the meeting, she said.\n\n\"The question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the DNC [Democratic National Committee] were coming from inappropriate sources.\n\n\"It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.\"\n\nMs Veselnitskaya denied ever having worked for the Russian government.\n\nIn a tweet sent after Ms Veselnitskaya's interview with NBC, Mr Trump Jr accused the media and Democratic Party of focusing on a\"nonsense meeting\"and of\"desperation\".\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, Russian officials said Moscow was ready to expel 30 US diplomats and seize US state property in retaliation for sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama over Russian hacking of Democratic Party computers.\n\nWhat is in the latest New York Times article?\n\nThe newspaper reports that three people with knowledge of the Goldstone email said it indicated the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information on Mrs Clinton.\n\nBut it says there was no mention in the email of any wider effort by the Russian government to interfere in the election, nor was there any indication of a link to the hacking attack on the Democratic Party that was first reported a week after the meeting.\n\nMr Goldstone has previously denied any knowledge of involvement by the Russian government. \n\nAdam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC that the New York Times report was\"a very serious development\"that required further investigation.\n\nMr Trump Jr's statement on the matter on Sunday did not indicate he had been told of any Russian government involvement.\n\nLawyer Alan Futerfas, hired by Mr Trump Jr to represent him in the Russia-related investigations, described reports of the meeting as\"much ado about nothing\"and said his client had done nothing wrong. \n\nThe president's son said he was\"happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know\".\n\nWhen was the meeting and how did it come to light?\n\nIt took place on 9 June 2016, just two weeks after Donald Trump secured the Republican nomination. \n\nAfter the New York Times first reported the meeting on Saturday, Mr Trump Jr released a statement which confirmed that it had taken place but did not mention whether it was related to the presidential campaign.\n\nHowever, another Times report, on Sunday, said Mr Trump Jr had agreed to the meeting after being offered information that would prove detrimental to Mrs Clinton.\n\nIn his statement on Sunday, Mr Trump Jr said he had been asked to meet\"an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign\".\n\nWhat was discussed at the meeting?\n\nMr Trump Jr's statement continues:\"The woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs Clinton.\n\n\"Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\"\n\nMr Trump Jr said the lawyer then changed the subject to the Magnitsky Act and\"it became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along\".\n\nAdopted by Congress in 2012, the Magnitsky Act allows the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved in human rights violations.\n\nMs Veselnitskaya is married to a Moscow government official and her clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin. She has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the act.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Mr Goldstone backed Mr Trump Jr's version of the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered\"just a vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding\"which was\"the most inane nonsense I've ever heard\".\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump Jr tweeted sarcastically:\"Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent...\"He also denied issuing conflicting statements.\n\nA spokesman for President Trump's legal team said the president was\"not aware of and did not attend\"the meeting.\n\nAnalysis: A grim situation for Trump Jr\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter \n\nWhether by plan or happenstance, Donald Trump Jr is stumbling into an increasingly dire situation.\n\nThe pattern has been set. The New York Times runs a story, Trump Jr issues his response, then the noose tightens. \n\nFirst he said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was about adoption issues. Then the Times reports that Trump Jr thought he would learn damaging information about Hillary Clinton. \n\nThe presidential son says he was conducting routine opposition research. Then the Times reports that he was told it was the Russian government itself that was coming to his father's aid.\n\nIn a traditional campaign, a foreign government's attempt to offer incriminating information about an opponent - or even the hint of such an overture - would set off all kinds of alarms. The FBI would have been notified. Senior staff would have insulated themselves from incrimination.\n\nThe Trump team was not a conventional campaign. And time and time again, it made novice mistakes or, more ominously, took unprecedented risks. \n\nIts candidate prevailed, but it has led to countless political headaches. Now it appears the president's own family, and his presidency itself, could be in peril.

But she would not offer any explanation as to why this may be the case.\n\nShe said:\"The study presents a robust and independent set of findings to inform discussion and debate, and to stimulate action. Further work - by Hefce, by the sector and by government - will be needed to understand why these effects are happening, and what sorts of interventions will be most effective in bringing about positive change.\"\n\nBut Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said:\"Dividing the school population into'state' and'private' is too crude to yield anything of value. \n\n\"The majority of our pupils' A-levels were graded A  or A* last summer and we note that Hefce, despite their best efforts, are unable to show that our pupils did less well at university than other groups.\"\n\nDr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of high-performing universities, said:\"As the report reiterates, A-level and equivalent qualifications are still, without doubt, the key source of information about academic ability. \n\n\"Students with better A-levels do better in higher education. But Russell Group universities take a range of factors into account when deciding which students are offered a place. \n\n\"So the candidate's qualifications are considered in a broader'context'. The bottom line is we want to give places to the pupils with the qualifications, potential and determination to succeed.\"\n\nThe study also found that students from disadvantaged areas tended to do less well than those from more advantaged areas - even though they had achieved the same A-level grades.\n\nProf Les Ebdon, director of fair access to higher education, said:\"This important research shows that a student's background influences their likely degree outcome. \n\n\"This is a worrying finding, suggesting that disadvantage continues to follow disadvantaged young people, even after they have overcome often significant barriers to get into university.\"\nTL;DR: State school pupils do better at university than independent school candidates who have achieved the same A-level grades, a study shows.\n\nArticle: The row of huts on Mablethorpe promenade will be\"rejuvenated and enhanced\"with the money.\n\nFourteen other coastal landmarks in England will benefit from a share of \u00a3700,000 from the Coastal Revival Fund.\n\nCommunities Minister Mark Francois said:\"We've got heritage hooks to be proud of, but some of these places need some tender loving care.\"\n\nHe said:\"This country has sightseeing gems that are a match for anywhere in the world and I'd urge people to take a trip down to the seaside to discover them.\"\n\nThe beach huts have been at Mablethorpe and Sutton-on-Sea for more than 70 years.\n\nGrants of up to \u00a350,000 will be awarded to landmarks from Durham in the North East to Dorset in the South West.\n\nLighthouse, museum and pier\n\nA disused lido in Morecambe, Lancashire, will become a venue for festivals, arts and leisure, while Herne Bay Pier in Kent will be given a\"sturdy stage\"with lighting, changing room and screen.\n\nIlfracombe Museum in Devon will receive \u00a350,000 to\"protect and preserve its unique collection of Victorian curiosities right on the seafront\".\n\nA full list of the projects can be seen here.\n\nIn March, \u00a3800,000 was also announced for seaside communities in the South West from the Coastal Communities Fund.\n\nMr Francois said he hoped the work would encourage\"a wave of enthusiasm\"for seaside trips, and help boost the \u00a34bn already generated each year by tourism to coastal communities.\nTL;DR: Dilapidated beach huts in Lincolnshire are to get a \u00a350,000 makeover in an attempt to attract more holidaymakers.\n\nArticle: Elaine Doyle, 16, died on her way home from a disco in Greenock, Inverclyde, on 1 June, 1986.\n\nHer body was found the next day in a lane off Ardgowan Street, less than 50 yards from her home. \n\nJohn Docherty, 48, made no plea or declaration during an appearance at Greenock Sheriff Court.

I now live with my three sons and two daughters-in-law.\n\nWe weren't scared earlier, but since these incidents happened, my family is very scared. My family feels good when they see security guards with us, but our senior officials aren't necessarily good with us. \n\nThis morning we were waiting and not leaving until the security personnel arrives, but our boss told us to leave, he told us our lives are in God's hands, and it's not like we're scared.\n\nWe are strong just like men when we are out working, but it was officially announced that we couldn't leave without the security personnel. \n\nLater, after we had left, the security personnel were sent to us and they stayed very near us, going to every house with us. \n\nPeople asked us:\"Why are people killing you? You people come here to save our children's lives, you never speak rudely, and you wait hours to give polio drops to our children.\"\n\nSo, people are quite surprised that LHWs are being killed. We just need constant support and we will work to the best of our abilities. \n\nWhen you earn 200 to 300 rupees a day ($2 to $3), it doesn't make any difference to people if you are killed\u2026 The only ones affected are our families.  \n\nMunawar Malik, Islamabad \n\nI've been working as a lady health worker since 2004, and I started this job because my husband didn't have a job at the time. I get about 1,000 rupees ($10) for a 5-day programme, and for the campaign I work from 08:00 to 15:00. \n\nEarlier, we didn't have any security, but after the incidents in the past couple of days, we've been given security in the form of police personnel - for every team of two, there are two policemen. Let's just hope this is a permanent change.\n\nIt's quite difficult working as a LHW because you go into areas where you don't know who the people are and how they'll react to you. \n\nBut what worries us the most is that if, God forbid, anything happens to us, then what will happen to our children? There is no insurance programme. \n\nI am personally not scared, I leave each morning after a prayer, but my family especially my children are very upset about me working. \n\nThey heard the news and my 11-year-old daughter cried and asked me not to go, my 10-year-old son also keeps on messaging me on my mobile phone to ask how I am doing. \n\nIt's not a safe job anymore, but I believe we must eradicate polio from Pakistan. \n\nWe are one out of three countries left where this disease exists and I want to be a part of this campaign.\nTL;DR:  BBC Urdu's Nosheen Abbas in Islamabad speaks to two health workers who have been working on the latest drive to eradicate the polio in Pakistan - one of just three in the world where the disease remains endemic. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Angela Harrison Education correspondent, BBC News \n\nOfficial figures  for the last quarter of 2012 show there were 893,000 people aged from 16 to 24 not in education, employment or training (Neet).\n\nThat is down from 957,000 for the same period in 2011.\n\nAmong 16- to 18-year-olds, 153,000 are Neet - the lowest figure in more than a decade for this quarter.\n\nAbout one in seven of those aged from 16 to 24 are Neet and about one in 11 of 16- to 18-year-olds. \n\nSkills Minister Matthew Hancock welcomed the falls:\"These figures show the proportion of young people not in employment, education or training has fallen sharply, and at 16-18 is the lowest comparable figure for a decade.\n\n\"Any number of young people Neet is too high, and the government will be working day and night to do still more on Apprentices, the Youth Contract, and the new Traineeships programme.\"\n\nGovernment figures out in January said more than 500,000 people started an apprenticeship between 2011 to 2012 - an increase of 14%.\n\nBut Labour says apprenticeships are increasingly being taken up by older people - and more effort should be put in to helping school and college leaders.\n\nKaren Buck MP, Labour's shadow minister for young people, said:\"Any headline fall in the numbers of young people out of work, education or training is welcome but there are still far too many young people who are dropping out.\n\n\"Most worrying is the increase in 18-year-olds who are out of work, education or training compared to 2010. It's not surprising given the number of apprenticeships going to young people is falling and the government abolished the Education Maintenance Allowance.\"\n\nA total of 92,000 18-year-olds were Neet in the last quarter of last year. That is the same figure as this time last year but up from 90,000 in 2010 and down from 104,000 in 2008.\nTL;DR: The number of young people not in education, training or work in England has fallen slightly since this time last year.\n\nArticle: Passengers have faced major disruption as hundreds of trains were cancelled following the introduction of new timetables in May.\n\nGTR, which runs Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, said chief executive Charles Horton would remain in post for a short time to oversee the development of a temporary timetable.\n\nThe RMT said:\"The rotten franchise he was steering remains in place.\"\n\nAnnouncing his resignation, Mr Horton said:\"I recognise that passengers have been hugely frustrated at the significant disruption caused by the introduction of new timetables.\n\n\"It is the right time to hand leadership of GTR to a new pair of hands.\"\n\nGTR - Britain's largest rail franchise - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May.\n\nPassengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning.\n\nThe changes affected the Southern rail, Gatwick Express, Thameslink and Great Northern networks.\n\nAbout 230 daily services were removed from GTR's routes to make for a\"more consistent timetable\", the company said.\n\nLast week, it emerged the firm was using taxis to make sure students could get to exams on time.\n\nAnd Mr Horton - who will be grilled by the Commons Transport Select Committee on Monday alongside other rail bosses -  admitted being delayed by his own trains.\n\nIn a letter to staff, he said:\"In my view, this was an industry-wide failure of the timetabling process. But with leadership comes responsibility and so I feel it is only right that I step down.\n\n\"Before my departure in a few weeks' time, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure a smooth handover as we work to put our railway back on track and give our passengers a reliable service once again.\"\n\nRMT general secretary Mick Cash said:\"Mr Horton may now have gone but the rotten franchise he was steering remains in place and no change at the top will alter that.\n\n\"This whole basket-case operation is a failure on every level.\"\n\nCharles Horton has been chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway since September 2014, having previously been managing director of Southeastern.\n\nHe started his career in transport at the London Underground in 1985, rising to station services director. \n\nMr Horton moved to Connex South Eastern in 2000. He then became managing director of Southern Railway from 2003 to 2006, when he moved to Southeastern.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent\n\nThe timetable launch was meant to be a new dawn for commuters of new, faster trains and more destinations.\n\nInstead it has been a total shambles and descended into cancellations, delays and commuter fury. And now the debacle has claimed its first victim, Charles Horton. \n\nHe has been resilient - even last week he told me he'd stay and sort the mess out - and he withstood pressure during extremely disruptive Southern strikes over guards' roles on trains.\n\nBut this timetable launch has been so disastrous he has fallen on his sword.\n\nIndustry sources say it doesn't mean he takes full responsibility - the timetable is an industry-wide issue. \n\nIt will all now be subject to an independent review.\n\nThe bad news for the nearly half-a-million commuters on the mega-franchise is this will not resolve cancellations and delays in the short-term.\n\nThere is a shortage of\"route-trained\"drivers for London's central tunnelled section, which could take months to resolve.\n\nEmily Ketchin, founder of campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, said:\"The so-called timetable that Thameslink is running today is more like a lottery.\n\n\"Customers need to see leadership and a rapid improvement to correct the errors that Mr Horton is leaving behind.\"\n\nAnthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said:\"Passengers will probably welcome a fresh start and this recognition of the problems.\"\n\nA Department for Transport spokesman said:\"Clearly the disruption that passengers have experienced following the recent timetabling changes has been unacceptable and it is right that the industry takes responsibility for its performance.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with GTR's leadership to deliver improved services for passengers. Meanwhile, an independent inquiry will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure this does not happen again.\"\n\nBedford commuters said Thameslink services were\"destroying lives\".\n\nKaty Marshall said trains were dangerously overcrowded, and Ellie Jones said people were left standing and\"falling into each other\"on trains, with nothing to hold on to.\n\nDawn Sawyer-Sheppard said:\"We cannot continue like this, it's destroying lives, jobs and towns.\"\n\nAnother commuter, Fabrizio Garguulo, described Thameslink as a\"poor excuse for a train service\".\n\nLouisa Branson said:\"I think that the mental health impact on all commuters is a ticking bomb. People are trying to be kind and decent to each other but after long busy days in the city, patience with one another is wearing very thin on the routes home.\n\n\"I for one struggle with being so up close and personal with my fellow sufferers.\"\n\nAA president and Thameslink season ticket holder Edmund King said it had gone beyond a joke, adding:\"If this sorry performance continues, more passengers will give up on the railways and take to the congested roads.\"\nTL;DR: The boss of beleaguered rail firm Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) is to resign.\n\nArticle: Dominic Cross, from Bromham, spent about 40 minutes in the air on Thursday doing\"tight turns\"over the Pewsey Vale tracing out the NHS.\n\nMr Cross, who shares the light aircraft with other pilots, had volunteered to do the monthly maintenance flight.\n\nHe said:\"Just going around in circles for an hour is boring so I decided to do something to cheer my wife up.\"\n\nAccording to the Civil Aviation Authority, government guidance\"permits essential maintenance activity to take place during the current Covid-19 restrictions\"but these flights\"must be kept to an absolute minimum in terms of both number and duration.\"\n\nMr Cross said the Grumman Tiger AA5B needed to be flown every four weeks for at least an hour, to stop it corroding.\n\nWhen he was on his way to the airfield at Wroughton he came up with the idea of\"flying the words NHS in the sky, with a little heart\".\n\n\"Just going around in circles for an hour is quite boring because you have to stay within 10 miles of the airfield, where you're based, so I just decided to go and do something I'd never done before,\"he said.\n\n\"My wife works in the NHS, she's working insane hours and I just wanted to try and cheer her up.\"\n\nUsing navigation software on his phone, Mr Cross started his sky writing 3,500ft (1,066m) over the Pewsey Vale and ended up over Hungerford.\n\n\"I tried to draw a heart at the beginning and that was a bit rubbish, but the NHS bit is the bit that matters,\"he said.\nTL;DR: A pilot has honoured his NHS worker wife by writing a message in the skies above Wiltshire.\n\nArticle: The body of Dennis Kellond was discovered at his home in Bletchingley Road, Godstone, on 27 April.

Indonesia has a four-level volcano alert system.\n\nWithin days the volcano showed increasing signs of activity, and authorities stepped up their alerts and evacuations of the rural villages surrounding the mountain. The area is now under the highest caution level.\n\nThousands of Balinese are now living in shelters in town halls and schools, with authorities trucking in tonnes of aid supplies. Some communities have also set up livestock shelters for the cows which they had to leave behind, reported The Jakarta Post.\n\nMany villagers are still visiting their homes in the daytime and life is continuing normally, according to Reuters.\n\nMount Agung, which is more than 3,000m above sea level, lies in the eastern part of Bali, which is a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe volcano is about 70km from the main tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak, which remain unaffected for now. \n\nFlights in and out of Bali are operating normally. The local tourism board said on Sunday that boats connecting to neighbouring islands Lombok and Java, also popular with holidaymakers, were on schedule. \n\nThe board added that though there was no volcanic ash detected, visitors were still advised to\"start preparing sufficient stock of face masks\"in case of an eruption.\n\nSeveral countries including Britain, Australia and Singapore have issued travel advisories for their citizens, warning of possible flight disruptions and evacuations.\n\nMore than 1,000 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. \n\nBali is much more densely populated than it was in 1963. But it also has better infrastructure, and technical developments have made it possible to detect dangers earlier and implement better emergency plans.\n\nMount Agung is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia - an archipelago prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes as it sits on the Pacific\"Ring of Fire\".\nTL;DR: The Red Cross says more than 42,000 people have been evacuated from their homes near an active volcano in Bali, as authorities warn it could erupt.\n\nArticle: Australia, China and the US collaborated in efforts to bring the patient back home.\n\nThe Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) hailed the\"outstanding success\"of an operation it described as\"complex and challenging\".\n\nDetails of the patient's condition were not made public.\n\nOfficials said it was not related to coronavirus.\n\nThe expeditioner was at Australia's Davis research station in east Antarctica when the mission began.\n\nThe AAD said that\"fortunately for the operation\"a Chinese icebreaker happened to pass by. It dispatched its helicopters to transfer a team of Australians to a site some 40km (25 miles) inland, so that they could build a ski-way for a US aircraft to land on and pick up the patient.\n\nMeanwhile, the US ski-equipped Basler aircraft flew 2,200km from the US McMurdo research station to Australia's Wilkins Aerodrome to pick up an Australian doctor.\n\nIt then flew to the ski-way near Davis, where it picked up the patient and returned to Wilkins Aerodrome. \n\nAn Australian Airbus A319 transported the patient back to the Australian city of Hobart on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe AAD said the multi-country collaboration was essential, as Australia does not currently have small ski-equipped intracontinental aircraft in Antarctica.\n\n\"Antarctica really brings nations together to support each other in our operations,\"said AAD director Kim Ellis.\n\n\"We've been doing these medevacs for a long time, but this particular operation was in the very best spirit of that multinational cooperation.\"\n\nYou might be interested in watching:\nTL;DR: An Australian expeditioner has been medically evacuated from Antarctica following a five-day mission involving

She said only 40% of planned\"value for money\"savings made in the last comprehensive spending review were made. \n\nMr Cameron said the government was\"not planning for failure\"and the savings had to be achieved. \n\nHe said when previous efficiency savings had been demanded\"there wasn't quite the same need to find them\":\"We are in a different situation because departments really can see that, in some cases, their base lines are being reduced.\"\n\nBut he added central government policies - like freezing public sector pay, changes to public sector pensions and reviewing procurement - would help them save money.\n\nHe said if they had stuck to Labour's plans\"then at the end of of the parliament we would still have a structural deficit of around 3%... after all the pain of cuts, the situation would still be getting worse. \n\n\"We have got to get to a situation where within this Parliament we have effectively dealt with the worst part of the problems.\"\n\nShe also challenged him on the impact of housing benefit changes - which include capping payments and changes to the way it is calculated. She said that would mean that poorer people would be forced out of central London into areas like her Barking constituency where\"there is already pressure and social unrest\"in part due to a lack of affordable housing.\n\n\"Is social unrest a price worth paying, and the impact that can have with the extreme right?,\"she asked.\n\nWelfare sanctions\n\nMr Cameron said she should ask people on between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 a year whether they were happy to be paying towards people whose rent bills were up to \u00a350,000 a year in central London.\n\n\"I think that is more likely, frankly, to lead to social unrest when people find out how much money they're paying in taxes for people to live in houses they couldn't dream of living in themselves.\"\n\nLabour MP Anne Begg, chairman of the work and pensions committee, asked what the\"rationale\"was behind plans to cut housing benefit by 10% to people on Jobseekers' Allowance for more than a year.\n\nShe said it was possible someone could apply for many jobs but remain unable to find one -\"That would be the first time in welfare history in this country where sanctions are being brought against someone who has done everything the government has asked of them.\"\n\nMr Cameron said the idea was to\"sharpen the incentives to work\"and said 90% of people on JSA got a job within a year and the government's\"work programme\"would help the others to do so. He said none of the changes were\"easy\"but everyone accepted that the housing benefit bill had to be tackled.\n\nHe added housing benefit would not be\"radically reduced\":\"All we're going to be able to do is stem the increase and perhaps a modest reduction.\"\n\nHe has also faced questions about the defence review - including the decision to scrap the UK's Harrier fleet and keep the Tornado. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin asked if it was true that that decision was taken at the last minute.\n\nMr Cameron said the reason it was taken late was\"this was the most difficult decision at the heart of the defence review\". He said although it would have been an easier decision to explain to keep the Harriers and scrap the Tornado, it would have been\"the wrong decision\". \n\nThe Tornado was the\"more capable aircraft\"- more effective as a\"ground attack aircraft\"and currently in use in Afghanistan - the government had wanted to support troops in Afghanistan, he said.\n\nThe prime minister also said he accepted the need for rapid decarbonisation of Britain's electricity supply over the next 20 years to meet long-term targets on climate change.\n\nAsked whether he endorsed projections by the advisory Committee on Climate Change that carbon emissions from electricity generation should fall by 80% between now and 2030, he said:\"Basically, yes\".\n\nThe committee evisages a major switch to electricity for heating and transport.\"If we don't decarbonise electricity we've got no hope of meeting all the targets that we are all committed to,\"said Mr Cameron.\n\nHe acknowledged that this meant bills might rise faster than they would otherwise.\nTL;DR: David Cameron has been challenged on the impact of cuts on defence and welfare by a committee of senior MPs. \n\n\n\nArticle: Foreign Minister Hector Timerman said it was a resolution for economic stability, peace and development.\n\nThe UN said countries should protect governments from minority creditors who refuse to go along with the majority in mutually agreed debt restructuring.\n\nArgentina has been fighting US hedge funds who are demanding full payment on defaulted bonds.\n\nThe hedge funds had refused to go along with the majority of the country's creditors and accept a restructuring deal. \n\nArgentina defaulted in 2001. The hedge funds scooped up its bonds at a fraction of the price and have since won US court backing to claim full payment. \n\nArgentina struck repayment deals in 2005 and 2010  with more than 90% of its creditors.\n\nThe government argues that if it pays the hedge funds the full amount, it would undermine the basis for the repayment deals struck with its other creditors. \n\nSome Caribbean countries have faced the same problem as Argentina.\nTL;DR: Argentina has welcomed a UN resolution creating a new global framework for sovereign debt restructuring.\n\nArticle: The two-year-old car will replace one of the council's Volkswagen Phaetons that was due to have its lease renewed.\n\nThe luxury car, which proudly bears the council's unique'G0' number-plate, will be used by Lord Provost Eva Bolander and other city representatives for appropriate civic duties.\n\nIt will also be used for VIPs who require transportation around the city.\n\nThe Lord Provost said:\"On behalf of the city, I'd like to thank the donor for their civic generosity and philanthropy. \n\n\"I want Glasgow to show its best face to the world and this gift will help us do that. \n\n\"It's a show-stopping car and a tremendous asset.\"\nTL;DR: A Rolls Royce Ghost, worth about \u00a3150,000, has been gifted to Glasgow City Council by a mystery donor.\n\nArticle: The case was closed after a prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to press charges against either the owners of the mine or regulators. \n\nOne of the miners said it was a\"disgrace for justice\"while a former minister called it\"unbelievable\".\n\nThe miners' rescue in a special capsule was followed live around the world.\n\n'Deep hole'\n\n\"This is a disgrace to Chile's justice system,'' one of the survivors, Mario Sepulveda, told Associated Press news agency, \n\n\"It is impossible that in an accident of this magnitude no-one is held responsible. Today, I want to dig a deep hole and bury myself again, only this time, I don't want anybody to find me, he said.\n\nOne of Mr Sepulveda's colleagues said he got in touch with their lawyers as soon as he heard about the decision.\n\n\"[They] told us to be calm. We have another lawsuit, for negligence,\"Luis Urzua told AFP, \n\nFormer mining minister Laurence Golborne, who was in charge of the rescue operations, expressed disbelief at the decision.\n\nHe told Chilean radio Cooperativa that regulators had ordered the owners of the century-old mine to build an emergency exit, but they did not comply. \n\nMr Golborne said that if the measure had been implemented the miners\"would not have spent 70 days trapped\".\n\nSenator Isabel Allende, daughter of the late President Salvador Allende, said the decision was\"painful\".\n\n\"It's hard to accept that the prosecution considers there is no-one responsible\", Ms Allende told EFE.\n\nBut defence lawyer Catherine Lathrop praised the decision.\n\n\"We have always maintained that it was a regrettable accident. Just that, an accident, and neither was it possible to establish any responsibility of my clients in this case,\"she said.\n\nThe collapse of the San Jose mine, near the town of Copiapo, left the 33 miners completely isolated for two weeks at a depth of about 700m.\n\nThey shared emergency rations to survive until rescue workers built a small shaft which was used to send supplies to the group.\n\nIn 2012, on the second anniversary of the collapse, many of the miners attended the inauguration of a monument at the mine.\n\nChilean billionaire Leonardo Farkas gave each of the miners a gift of $10,000 (\u00a36,600) after the rescue. \n\nThe miners hope that a lawsuit filed a year after the collapse accusing the National Service of Geology and Mining of having not inspected working conditions and mine safety can bring each of them reparations of $500,000 (\u00a3330,000).\n\nThe owners of the mine have been told to reimburse the government a quarter of the rescue operation which cost around $22m.\nTL;DR: An investigation into the 2010 accident in Chile that left 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months has failed to find anyone responsible.\n\nArticle: By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Politics Reporter\n\nJust hours after the party's leader, Arlene Foster, gave an interview to the BBC and accused the EU's Brexit negotiator of not being an\"honest broker\"in the talks and misunderstanding the unionist position, all eyes were on Michel Barnier as the press conference began.\n\nHis response was brief - but robust.\n\nHe said he was not ready to engage in\"polemics\"with Mrs Foster and denied that he had ever acted aggressively towards Northern Ireland unionists during the negotiations, but some may feel his words came too late.\n\nHe also told reporters his\"door is open\"to Mrs Foster and the DUP - we'll see if he holds it open for them or slams it shut on Thursday, when the two sides are expected to meet. \n\nWhile there were representatives from Sinn F\u00e9in, the SDLP and Alliance speaking at the forum, the Ulster Unionists were nowhere in sight either.\n\nLike the DUP, the party feels the forum, which has now met four times and was set up after the EU referendum result in 2016, is simply a\"talking shop\"and that there is no need to attend when there are already cross-border cooperation bodies to examine Brexit.\n\nFor those who were there, however, the forum represented a chance for hundreds of political and business delegates and students from north and south to hear directly from the EU's main man.\n\nIt almost became Brexit bingo - as journalists lost count of how many times Michel Barnier referenced the\"backstop\"option for the Irish border.\n\nThe backstop would mean that in the absence of any other solution, Northern Ireland, or the UK as a whole, would align with EU rules required to support north-south cooperation and an all-island economy.\n\nWhile in principle the UK signed up to this option, precise detail on it has yet to appear.\n\nMr Barnier's three points were:\n\nIn brief - the backstop was agreed so let's get on with it. \n\nThat call was echoed by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Leo Varadkar, and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who hosted Monday's event.\n\nThey were also keen to stress that\"meaningful progress\"on the border issue needs to be made by June's European Council summit, otherwise getting the withdrawal agreement ready by October could prove difficult.\n\nThe audience at Monday's event applauded loudly for Michel Barnier and the Irish government, but it felt a bit like a Brexit bubble - all the more noticeable as students at the Dundalk Institute of Technology pushed their way past the media scrum - more interested in getting to class than in the minutiae of Brexit.\nTL;DR: The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) may not have been at Monday's all-island Brexit forum in Dundalk, but its presence was still very much felt.\n\nArticle: The scheme, operated by dial-a-ride Worcester Wheels, will connect Norton, Littleworth and Brockhill residents with the city centre from 14 September.\n\nCouncils acted after normal First Bus services did not return, parish councillor John Waizeneker said.\n\nThe company said it axed the service because it was\"poorly supported\"by locals. \n\nThe new Norton Connector service, which Norton-Juxta-Kempsey Parish Council helped to set up, will connect people to Worcester city centre and the new Parkway station.\n\nMr Waizeneker said:\"[What] was made very clear to us by the previous or the current bus providers is that these rural routes do not pay.\n\n\"So I think community bus services are very much the state of the future and... if the community wants it, the community does something about it.\"\n\nWorcestershire County Council found a spare minibus,\"so they've leased to Worcester Wheels\", Mr Waizeneker added.\n\nHe stated:\"We did a survey of interest in the parish and we got a very, very high rate of interest, both in the fact that we were talking about providing a service, but also from people saying if we did provide a service, they would use it.\"\n\nHowever Nigel Eggleton, the managing director at First Worcester, said only a\"small number of people\"wanted to travel to the city by bus.\n\n\"Our 50s service ran for over 12 months but was very poorly supported by local residents from the villages,\"he said, leading to the decision not to reinstate the service.\n\nThe not-for-profit Worcester Wheels group said it had been approached by parish councils, Wychavon District Council and the county council over the new scheme.\n\nAsked about the impact lockdown had had, its business development manager, Dormston Cook, said a lot of clients had had to self-isolate because of their ages and there had been a reduced service.\n\nThe organisation has 10 vehicles, including eight minibuses.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

A no-win dilemma where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  \n\nBut fewer people will have read the 1961 novel of the same name that propelled the phrase into the English language. \n\nCatch-22 was published 50 years ago. Written by Joseph Heller, it describes the wartime experiences of B-25 bombardier, Captain John Yossarian. Heller himself had served as a US Air Force bombardier in World War II. \n\nHe drags us through the muck and absurdity of a droll group of WWII airmen stationed on a small island off the coast of Tuscany - taking in the dark and brutal nature of war. In it hero Yossarian takes drastic measures to avoid flying an ever-increasingly required number of dangerous missions. \n\nThe only way to avoid such deadly assignments was to plead insanity, but to do so exposed a desire to live - a core aspect of the sane. \n\nPaul Bates, 42, understands Yossarian's plight. A lieutenant colonel with the British army's Royal Artillery regiment, he is currently working as the operations officer with the US Marine Corps in Afghanistan, he says Heller is spot-on in his depiction of this internal conflict.\n\n\"Many observers say that the character of conflict changes because of such things as technological advances. But the nature of conflict, the brutal, chaotic nature of it and the associated emotions - fear, exhilaration, anxiety, courage - remain the same. \n\n\"I see that in the book and have experienced it throughout my time in the Army. Yossarian was afraid of dying, so were many of his colleagues, and he was going to do everything in his power to try to prevent it from happening.\"\n\nYossarian, who of course was drafted into the war, takes drastic measures to avoid flying dangerous missions. These include poisoning the squadron, making up fictitious ailments to stay in hospital and moving the bomb line on the map during the\"Great Big Siege of Bologna\".\n\nLt Col Bates says other Catch-22 characters are just as recognisable.\n\n\"Others were fatalists. They say things like:'If you're destined to be killed over Bologna, then you're going to be killed, so you might just as well go out and die like a man.' Both of these approaches are ways to deal with fear of existing in a profession where you are trained to kill and might be killed yourself.\n\n\"I've seen them both on operations along with others, like the blase demeanour of Aarfy or Havermeyer's invincibility complex. I myself am a fatalist. If it's your time, it's your time.\"\n\n'Self-serving orders'\n\nLt Col Bates also sees similarities in frustrations surrounding the military's hierarchical organisation, which gives rise to comic, inept characters in command positions such as Cathcart, Dreedle and Peckem.\n\nThere is a quote in the book:\"Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three.\" It sums up a character who was unjustly promoted to the rank of major, on account of his birth name.\n\n\"By virtue of their appointment alone and their position in the chain of command, they are allowed to get away with enforcing outrageous self-serving orders that those below are powerless to resist for fear of extreme military punishment,\"says Col Bates.\n\nHeller wrote of the combat men in the squadron being\"bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other\", unable to object to orders.\n\nIn Catch-22, for those lower down the food chain, there is nowhere to go to question methods. The same can be true today mainly because the army employs the same top-down reporting system that was in place 70 years ago, says Lt Col Bates.\n\n\"This is where the military finds itself in a Catch-22. It needs to adopt a strict hierarchical system in order to fulfil its mission. There is little time for debate in a conflict situation. And yet this system can give birth to both brilliance and toxicity.\"\n\nWhen the book was published in 1961, reviews were polarised, ranging from\"the best novel in years\"to\"disorganised, unreadable, and crass\". Views still are. \n\nRex Temple, a retired US Air Force senior master sergeant, says he a hard time reading Heller's comical depiction of life in the armed forces. He found it hard relating to the characters, their actions and their relationships. \n\n\"Perhaps I am a bit biased because I served 28 years in a more mature and reformed service. Even past discussions with World War II veterans did not reveal anything like that portrayed in Catch-22.\n\n\"Our current military is much more disciplined and respectful than the characters portrayed by Heller. There really is no comparison to the current tours in Afghanistan or Iraq.\"\n\nAlthough he did find one similarity - field mice in the tents.\n\nInsanity and absurdity\n\n\"Except [now] an individual would be court-martialled if they used their government-issued weapons to kill rodents inside. Generally, it is forbidden to eat food inside because the falling crumbs attract insects, which attract lizards or mice,\"he says.\n\nDr Roy Heidicker, 4th Fighter wing historian based at the US Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, says those who serve are too busy with their duties to appreciate the irony of their circumstances. \n\nDuring his time serving in the US Marine Corps, Dr Heidicker acted as battery supply officer, just like the outrageous Milo Minderbinder - Heller's mess officer who runs an international black-market syndicate.  \n\nHe pursues profit unscrupulously, but insists that\"everyone has a share\"in the syndicate. A classic interaction has Minderbinder looking to trick Yossarian into eating, and enjoying, chocolate-covered cotton, as he desperately tries to find a way to feed the men his latest acquisition, seeds and all.\n\n\"Milo would have been proud of me as I developed my own'everybody wins' method of doing business,\"says Heidicker. \n\n\"If battalion supply didn't have it, chances were I did. I brought my system with me when I ran Regimental Special Services and had a flair for trading excess equipment for short equipment resulting in perfect inventories.\"\n\nWhen someone writes the next great military novel, Dr Heidicker says, all insanity and absurdity will be documented through politicians, pundits and the man on the street. \n\n\"Bless Joseph Heller for a guidebook for the past 50 years. We search, hopefully not in vain, for a guidebook to help us through the next 50.\"\nTL;DR: The classic novel that coined the term describing impossible situations is celebrating its 50th birthday. So how close does Catch-22 come to accurately portraying today's military?\n\nArticle: Aidan James, 28, of Formby, Merseyside, had no previous military knowledge when he allegedly set out to join the war in 2017 alongside the YPG Kurdish militia.\n\nThe Old Bailey heard that in diary entries he told how he got\"a kill\"and was\"playing my part in this war and feel good to be a part of history\".\n\nMr James denies terrorism offences.\n\nHe is accused of receiving training from the PKK before going on to fight with the People's Protection Unit known as the YPG in Syria.\n\nOn the second day of his trial, the jury was shown Facebook pictures of Mr James posing with YPG insignia wearing military garb.\n\nIn a December 2017 diary entry, he allegedly wrote:\"The situation with Turkey continues to worsen the war is long from over but I am playing my part in this war and feel good to be a part of history and with the revolutionary force of YPG.\n\n\"Daesh is the biggest threat the world has seen since Hitler so anything I can do in these operations is good.\"\n\nIn an earlier entry, Mr James allegedly wrote of his group's\"quest to vanquish Daesh from this place\"and how he got\"a kill\"that day.\n\nThe court heard how a police negotiator was in email contact with him, promising to support him and discuss his return to Liverpool.\n\nMr James wrote of the\"amazing time\"he had fighting on the\"front line numerous times\", killing Islamic State soldiers.\n\nThe court heard he returned to Liverpool John Lennon airport on 14 February last year.\n\nMr James denies engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and two charges of attending a place used for terrorist training.\n\nThe trial continues.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nHM Courts Service\nTL;DR: A British man wrote of his joy at fighting against the Islamic State group, describing it as \"the biggest threat since Hitler\", a court heard.\n\nArticle: By Catherine EvansBBC News\n\nThe Ladies of Rage music collective began in Cardiff and now has more than 400 members across Wales.\n\nFocusing mainly on urban and Mobo (music of black origin) genres, it encourages greater racial and gender diversity.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the group's members have supported each other with online gigs, playlists and chats.\n\nDespite missing being onstage, its members are celebrating International Women's Day with local radio takeovers and a bilingual EP called Harddwch Du/Black Beauty which features only women of colour with lyrics exploring\"being brown and Welsh\"and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe group has produced podcasts, mixtapes, tracks, poems, discussions and interviews for a takeover on digital radio station Dub Frequency Radio on Monday.\n\n'Male allies'\n\nThe celebrations will be tinged with sadness though, as they pay tribute to much-loved south Walian producer Rob Stagg, known as Stagga, who was an integral part of the Cardiff underground music scene and died of a heart attack just before Christmas.\n\n\"His studio was just the perfect space for what we wanted to do,\"said founder Ffion Wyn. \n\n\"He was such a kind soul and really understood the ethos of what we were trying to achieve and just opened his doors up to us and encouraged some of the women that were attending the jam sessions to record with him.\"\n\nLadies of Rage member Amelia Unity said:\"We need male allies to make change. I would never have had the confidence or self-belief to release any music if it wasn't for his encouragement, and it's thanks to him that I'm now learning to produce my own music.\"\n\nShe added the collective had been\"life-changing\"for her, personally and professionally.\n\n\"I've always been into hip hop and I've always been used to being the only woman - or in the minority at least - at events. So I'm used to just being around men.\n\n\"After having been to a few Ladies of Rage jams and it being like this gap, that I didn't even know was a gap, was filled... I felt safe, where before I didn't even realise I didn't feel safe because it was just normal.\"\n\n'Wales is the land of song - so let's sing'\n\nChair Dionne Bennett said the collective aimed to inspire a new generation of musicians, after she left Wales at a young age and pursued her career in London.\n\n\"I don't think I'd be doing what I'm doing without a group like this that supported me in my journey,\"she said. \n\n\"So it was absolutely essential for me as a singer and as a musician to do something to give back, to give other kids and give black women like myself the opportunities that I've had. \n\n\"Some members have gone back into education because of us, some members have increased their confidence, done things they would never have done before. We've upskilled each other, we're always continuing to share knowledge and experience, making sure that we're creating safe spaces so that members feel they can be heard and can be listened to. \n\n\"What we've done through the pandemic is basically be there to support each other; it's been quite hard not to be able to perform, you miss that sisterhood as well. \n\n\"We're Welsh and we need to create a vibrant music scene - and that comes from diversity, that comes from equality. It doesn't come from shutting people out. Wales is not just indie music, black music is not just hip hop. I just hope the next generation gets more opportunity here and can be proud to be diverse, Welsh and play black music - and why not? Wales is the land of song - so let's sing.\"\n\n'If we don't sing about it, the narrative won't change'\n\nLadies of Rage member and reggae artist Aleighcia Scott, who features on Black Lives Matters protest song Freedom, said:\"I've been involved for a few years now and I first remember seeing the group on Facebook and I thought it was a really great space to feel safe and for encouragement. It's really nice to have a gathering of like minds.\n\n\"I definitely feel there needs to be more representation in the Welsh industry as a whole. But I'm glad now these conversations are being had. If we don't talk about it or sing about it the narrative won't be changed.\"\n\nAs a full-time performer, Aleighcia was used to doing shows four or five times a week before the pandemic hit. So Ladies of Rage has helped her to adjust as live music was shelved, venues closed and audiences were ordered to stay home.\n\n\"I think I've done three shows in a year,\"she said.\"It's definitely been something I've had to adjust to, working from home and online live sessions. But Ladies of Rage has been a place where people can talk about how they're feeling or it's a place to build and grow.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to when everything is back to whatever normal is going to be, when the group can have even more ideas and we can come together and make something amazing.\"\nTL;DR: Female and non-binary musicians who formed a network of artists say it has helped them find a \"safe space\" in the industry.\n\nArticle: Meeting Theresa May for talks in Paris, Francois Hollande said he recognised the UK needed time to prepare but stressed:\"The sooner the better.\"\n\nHe said the UK's choice was to stay in the single market and accept freedom of movement or to\"have another status\".\n\nMrs May said she would deliver on demands for\"controls\"on movement.\n\nGreatest danger\n\nDuring a joint press conference with the UK's prime minister following talks at the Elysee Palace, he said he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU and said, in terms of a timescale for negotiating a new relationship:\"For France, the sooner the better.\"\n\n\"There cannot be discussions or pre-negotiations before the negotiations, but we can of course prepare these negotiations and we can understand that your government, that's just been formed, needs this time.\"\n\nHe said uncertainty was the greatest danger and also repeated France's argument that the UK could only get access to the single market if it accepted the free movement of people.\n\n\"It will be a choice facing the UK - remain in the single market and then assume the free movement that goes with it or to have another status.

and if we continue to overspend at the level we have done, it will break many of our budgets. \n\n\"Many councils in the future may be unable to set a balanced budget, whilst others will have to reduce other budgets further, which would run the risk of not being able to deliver statutory duties.\n\n'Looking carefully'\n\n\"It is clear that the current system is not working effectively when nearly two-thirds of councils nationwide over the past year are not reaching the expected level of service in their special educational needs departments.\"\n\nA Department for Education spokesman said:\"We know that costs are rising in areas of the country, which is causing challenges for local authorities, and we are aware of the pressures on school budgets more generally, including the increasing costs of making provision for children with more complex needs. \n\n\"We are looking carefully at how much funding for education will be needed in future years, as we approach the next spending review.\"\n\nHe added that high needs funding for children and young people with the most complex needs had also been increased, from \u00a35bn in 2013 to well over \u00a36bn this year.  In December, an extra \u00a3250 million was pledged.\n\nA spokeswoman for campaigning group SEND action said the county councils' warning was extremely concerning.\n\n'Legal rights'\n\nShe highlighted how the network acknowledges that two-thirds of councils have already failed to reach the expected level of service in SEND provision over the past year.\n\nShe added:\"On June 26 three disabled children and their families took a judicial review against the Secretary of State for Education and Chancellor over the government's SEND funding policy. \n\n\"The government's barrister argued that where local authorities have statutory duties towards Paul (disabled children), then they must rob Peter to pay Paul.\n\n\"It shouldn't be necessary to\"rob\"anyone to secure disabled children's legal rights. \n\n\"The government put in place reforms that councils are legally responsible for implementing, but did not provide sufficient funding. \n\n\"Now councils are saying SEND duties are breaking their budgets.\n\n\"The reality is that disabled children and their families are being broken by an underfunded and dysfunctional SEND system which frequently fails to meet basic statutory duties.\"\nTL;DR: The explosion in demand for special educational needs (SEN) support is threatening English county councils' ability to meet their legal duties.\n\nArticle: But Ashley Graham's new collection for Swimsuits for All, which is being promoted with untouched, unedited photos of the plus-size model, seems quite different.\n\nRetouched images are used as standard by the fashion industry and in the media, and fans have said they wish more models would follow Ashley's lead. \n\nAshley said the photos were a reminder that\"being authentic is beautiful.\"\n\nThe model, who has 6.7 million followers, was the first size 14 model to feature on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine and backs the #BeautyBeyondSize campaign.\n\nShe has worked with Swimsuits For All on a swimwear collection for women up to size 34.\n\nThe\"Power of Paparazzi\"campaign appears to reflect a desire for more transparency around touching up and editing fashion images, as well as a demand for broader definitions of beauty. \n\nIn an Instagram post, the retailer said:\"Looking at the #unretouched photos from our #Summer2018 shoot with @theashleygraham, we thought'why not use these as the campaign images?'\"\n\nSwimsuits for All said the collection was inspired by the 1920s - specifically\"that generation's strong, female pioneers\".\n\nAshley added in a statement:\"I'm not ashamed of a few lumps, bumps or cellulite\u2026 and you shouldn't be either.\"\n\nThe model's followers welcomed the untouched photos.\n\nSuskimo89 said:\"Thank you for using unedited images!

They say these cases - all from the western state of Maharashtra - show that\"the victims are ready to fight but there was no mechanism to help them\". \n\nDespite the laws to protect Dalits, more than 40,000 crimes against lower castes were reported in 2016 alone, according to official statistics. In the past, conflicts between Dalits and upper castes were restricted to fights over land, wages, water, housing and the practice of untouchability. \n\nHowever, according to activists, rising aspirations among young Dalits have fuelled violence against them by upper-caste community members who are unable to accept this.\n\nFound in a field\n\nSagar Shejwal, a 24-year-old nursing student, travelled to the town of Shirdi in May 2015 to attend a friend's wedding. During the trip, Mr Shejwal went to a liquor store with two of his cousins and his phone started to ring while he was there. His ring tone was a song that paid tribute to Dr B R Ambedkar, a Dalit icon and revered Indian leader. \n\nAccording to the police complaint, a group of eight men who had been drinking outside the shop objected to the ring tone and asked him to change it. The verbal spat reportedly turned violent and the men allegedly hit Mr Shejwal with a bottle, kicking and punching him before taking him away on a motorbike. \n\nPolice say they found his body hours later in a field. His autopsy showed that he had suffered multiple fractures - allegedly caused by a motorbike being run over him repeatedly. \n\nThe accused men have been granted bail. \n\nFound in a quarry\n\nManik Udage, 25, was allegedly beaten to death with a steel rod in 2014 because he had organised a grand event to celebrate the anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar's birth.\n\nThe venue for the event was a neighbourhood in Pune city where many upper-caste families lived. Some of them did not want the event to be held there and asked Mr Udage, a contractor, to shift the venue but he reportedly refused. \n\nHis family alleges that four men arrived at their home in the early hours of 1 May and took Mr Udage away. His body was found in a quarry on 3 May. \n\nThe four accused, all men from upper castes, are now in jail. They have been denied bail several times. But Mr Udage's brother, Shravan, fears that his family is still under threat. He says he feels nervous every time he passes through the neighbourhood where the families of the accused men live. \n\nHanging from a tree\n\nNitin Aage, a 17-year-old boy from a village called Kharda, was found hanging from a tree on 28 April 2014. \n\nAccording to the police, Nitin had been seen speaking to a girl from an upper-caste community at their school. Three men, including the girl's brother, had allegedly been harassing him for some time because they suspected he was in a romantic relationship with her. \n\nPolice said he was first beaten at the school and then allegedly taken to a property owned by the girl's family where he was strangled to death. They believe he was hanged from a tree to make it appear as if he had taken his own life. \n\nThe 13 men who were accused in the murder were acquitted in November 2017. Nitin's family has been demanding a retrial since then. \n\n'Staged to look like suicide'\n\nSanjay Danane, 38, was found hanging near the school where he worked in 2010. His parents allege that he was killed by his upper-caste colleagues because of a dispute at work and that they staged the death to resemble a suicide. \n\nPolice arrested about 18 people, including teachers, board members and the school's principal. They have since been granted bail. \n\nDeprived of water supply\n\nTen-year-old Rajashree Kamble hurt herself on the head when she slipped and fell while fetching water. Her father, Namdev, alleges that his daughter would be alive if the Dalit neighbourhood where they live had received their daily supply of water.\n\nIn February 2016, the wells in the village had dried up because of a drought in the region. Mr Kamble says the village council managed to supply water to other neighbourhoods in the village but refused to do the same for his neighbourhood despite repeated requests. \n\nHe says he tried to lodge a police complaint against the village head and other officials but he was unable to do so. \n\n'Stabbed for digging a well'\n\nMadhukar Ghadge, 48, was allegedly killed by 12 upper-caste men for digging a well on his land, which was surrounded by lands owned by them. \n\nHe was allegedly digging the well when he was assaulted with a\"spear-like\"weapon. His relatives say he was pronounced dead when they arrived at the nearest hospital. \n\nMr Ghadge's wife and son say his murder was also driven by the fact that theirs was an educated family that was involved in local politics. \n\nThree years later, a lower court acquitted all 12 accused because of lack of evidence. An appeal is still pending in the Mumbai high court. \n\nBeheaded and burnt\n\nThe day before he turned 19, on 30 April 2009, Rohan Kakade did not return home. His parents began searching for him and they found his body hours later- he had been beheaded and his body set on fire. \n\nThe accused - five upper-caste men - allegedly believed he was in a relationship with one of their sisters. But Mr Kakade's parents say the two were not in love. The girl would occasionally call him and they were friends. \n\nTwo-and-half years after Mr Kakade's death, his father died. His mother continued to fight the case but all five accused were acquitted by the courts.\n\nSudharak Olwe is an award-winning photographer based in Mumbai.\nTL;DR: A recent exhibition in the Indian city of Mumbai documented Dalit (formerly known as \"untouchable\") families that have lost a loved one because of discrimination and violence.

Those that don't will face scrutiny from my office to check they have taken appropriate steps to protect fundamental privacy rights.\"\n\nThe incident was first disclosed on 6 September 2018 and BA had initially said approximately 380,000 transactions were affected, but the stolen data did not include travel or passport details.\n\nWhat information was stolen?\n\nThe ICO said the incident was believed to have begun in June 2018.\n\nThe watchdog said a variety of information was\"compromised\"by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.\n\nBA initially said information involved included names, email addresses, credit card information such as credit card numbers, expiry dates and the three-digit CVV code found on the back of credit cards.\n\nThe watchdog said BA had co-operated with its investigation and made improvements to its security arrangements.\n\nWhat are the new rules?\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force last year and was the biggest shake-up to data privacy in 20 years.\n\nThe penalty imposed on BA is the first one to be made public since those rules were introduced, which make it mandatory to report data security breaches to the information commissioner.\n\nIt also increased the maximum penalty to 4% of turnover. The BA penalty amounts to 1.5% of its worldwide turnover in 2017, less than the possible maximum.\n\nUntil now, the biggest penalty was \u00a3500,000, imposed on Facebook for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.  That was the maximum allowed under the old data protection rules that applied before GDPR.\n\n'Sending a shiver down the spine'\n\nI imagine that many people's first reaction to the \u00a3183m fine that the Information Commissioner plans to levy on British Airways will have mirrored mine - surely the decimal point must be in the wrong place? \n\nAfter all the proposed penalty is roughly 367 times as high as the previous record fine, the \u00a3500,000 imposed on Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nThe difference, of course, is that the law has changed between the two incidents, with the arrival of a new law mirroring Europe's GDPR. This allows fines of up to 4% of annual turnover. \n\nNow you might have expected the data regulator to be somewhat cautious at first in wielding this powerful new weapon but today's news will send a shiver down the spine of anyone responsible for cybersecurity at a major corporation. \n\nThe message is clear - if you don't treat your customers' data with the utmost care expect severe punishment when things go wrong. \n\nBritish Airways certainly appears to be stunned. But then again it could have been worse: the full 4% of turnover would have meant a fine approaching \u00a3500m.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBA has 28 days to appeal. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said British Airways would be making representations to the ICO.\n\n\"We intend to take all appropriate steps to defend the airline's position vigorously, including making any necessary appeals,\"he said.\n\nAlex Cruz, British Airways' chairman and chief executive, said the airline was\"surprised and disappointed\"in the ICO's initial finding.\n\n\"British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers' data. We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft.\n\n\"We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this event caused.\"\n\nFraudster attempted to shop at Harrods\n\nDavid Champion believes that the BA data breach probably led to his credit card being used fraudulently.\n\nHe says he was notified that his card had been used in an attempt to buy items at Harrods by phone while he was in Malaysia.\n\n\"BA are claiming there were no fraudulent transactions from the leak. My card details, I don't think, weren't exposed anywhere else,\"he told the BBC.\n\nThe transaction was rejected and Mr Champion was not left out of pocket.\n\n\"BA contacted me in August/September about the breach, that addresses and emails were leaked. Later they said credit card details were too,\"he added.\n\nHe was worried as he knew he had used BA's site twice, and said that it was right that BA was being penalised for the incident.\n\nWhere does the money go?\n\nThe penalty is divided up between the other European data authorities, while the money that comes to the ICO goes directly to the Treasury.\n\nIt is up to individuals to claim money from BA, which provided no information on whether any compensation had been paid.\n\nUnder the regulations, authorities in the EU whose residents have been affected will also have the chance to comment on the ICO's findings.\nTL;DR: British Airways is facing a record fine of \u00a3183m for last year's breach of its security systems.\n\nArticle: State news agency KCNA described the device, fired into the Sea of Japan, as a\"surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile\". \n\nSouth Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump.\n\nNorth Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned. \n\nThe US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. \n\nChina said it opposed North Korean missile tests and Russia said it was concerned, calling on all parties to prevent any escalation in tensions. \n\n'Great satisfaction'\n\nKCNA said the missile, named the Pukguksong-2, was a\"new type strategic weapon system\".\n\nIt said the missile used a solid-fuel engine, which gives ballistic missiles greater range and means they can be readied for launch faster than liquid-fuel missiles.  \n\nIt was a new version of a missile test-fired from a submarine in August 2016 and was fired in a high arc in consideration of neighbouring countries, the report said.\n\nKim Jong-un\"expressed great satisfaction\"over the test launch, which added\"to the tremendous might of the country\", the state news agency said.\n\nNorth Korea said that the missile could be tipped with a nuclear warhead.

Passengers on public transport went up 25%. \n\nSome Tube stations switched to exit only as would be expected but there were other issues.\n\nFor example St James' station had a problem with platform equipment and had to close. \n\nAlso repairs to the London Overground took all day after a power failure. That will be a concern, as the speed of recovery will be vital during the Olympics.\n\nBut in the main it seems the Tube and roads coped pretty well.\n\nNot prepared\n\nThe train companies fared a lot worse. \n\nMany simply were not prepared for the numbers of travellers on the Sunday. Some ran only an enhanced Sunday service; trains, unsurprisingly, were packed. \n\nThere are bound to be questions now about how the train companies came to the conclusion that an enhanced Sunday service could cope. \n\nWho did the modelling? On what were the numbers based? \n\nDid the train companies engage with the Met Police and TfL who seemed to correctly predict the numbers? \n\nWas the lack of capacity a financial decision? \n\nA spokesperson for the Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said:\"There were extra services and extra carriages to get people to and from London yesterday.\n\n\"But operators have to make a call on how many services to run based on projected demand well in advance.\n\n\"Clearly in instances where overcrowding did cause problems, operators would apologise to passengers.\"\n\nThe lack of capacity on rail meant crowd control systems were implemented at a number of mainline stations. \n\nExpect to see much more of that this summer. And remember the Olympics will be a much bigger test of the transport system spread over two weeks. \n\nThe key message will be to avoid the hot spots and use less busy routes.\n\nTransport chiefs did not want to call it publicly a dry run for the Olympics - but it was.\n\nAm I being fair? Let me know your experiences.\nTL;DR: So how did London cope?  \n\n\n\nArticle: Andrew HardingAfrica correspondent@BBCAndrewHon Twitter\n\nFor years these men have turned their neighbourhood - a collection of drab brick apartment blocks clustered round a patch of grass known locally as\"the killing fields,\"in the shadow of Cape Town's Table Mountain - into something resembling a war zone. \n\nPrison gangs and their local affiliates, with names like the \"Mongrels\",\"Americans\",\"Corner Boys\"and\"Funky Junkies\"have been locked in a violent struggle for control of the lucrative drugs trade. \n\nIt has been a particularly ferocious few months. As we arrive in Lavender Hill, we are told three gang members were shot dead overnight in a nearby district.\n\n\"This is pathetic what is going on in our community. People are giving up hope. We got caught in the crossfire this morning. People are scared to walk,\"said Maureen Osvoel, a teacher from Hanover Park.\n\n\"We don't search\u2026 but I imagine they are well protected,\"said Dr Ruben Richards when I asked if he thinks the gang leaders now attending his weekly reconciliation sessions are armed. \n\nSome of the younger men - slouching, with baseball hats pulled down over unexpressive eyes - fit the familiar cliches of the gangster. But others are plump, unremarkable, middle aged figures - one in a rugby shirt, another with a thick beard.\n\nThe sessions are being organised by local community and religious leaders as part of a new scheme to try to nudge the gangs away from the drugs trade. \n\n\"Without justifying the criminal economy, you have to understand that the dynamics are exactly the same as the legitimate economy,\"said Dr Richards, a facilitator who was involved in South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\n\"These are to all intents and purposes the leaders of the community. This is where power and money is. We have to find a way to re-channel that energy.\"\n\nIt is early days.  We are told one of the men at the meeting recently ordered a hit on another. Later in the week, Dr Richards emails me to say that\"a jammed gun\"just saved another gangster from a point-blank range attack.\n\nBut the meetings continue. At this stage, none of the gang leaders wants to be publically identified for fear that his involvement in the reconciliation process could make him a target for rivals. But one burly man, who admits to spending seven years in jail for murder, agrees to talk anonymously. \n\nEasy money\n\n\"If you don't have a job, it is quick and easy to get money from drugs. People don't see any other way out,\"said the gang leader.\n\n\"But I'm worried about future generations. A lot of blood has flowed. We have the community at heart. It may not look like it right now but we do. This process is changing the way I think.\"\n\nLast week Dr Richards asked the men to write about their lives. This week the discussion ranges from South Africa's history to the source of the men's anger.\n\nThe sessions are due to culminate with all the gangs cooperating in a project to install solar-powered water heaters in Lavender Hill. \n\nBut the chances of that happening remain slim.\n\n\"All it takes is one hit to derail the process,\"says Dr Richards. \n\nStill, the local gangs already have one achievement under their belt - a truce that has now lasted for four months.\n\n\"It's totally unprecedented,\"said Pastor Stanford Hill, showing me round the neighbourhood outside. \n\nHe's a self-confessed\"ex-druggie, ex-con, ex-gangster\", who is behind the reconciliation talks in Lavender Hill. \n\n\"By the grace of God, for the last four months the shooting has stopped. No gang-related killings.\"he tells me.\n\n\"Also what is encouraging to us is that the members of the gangs are willing to participate every week and sit around the table,\"\n\nIn the tiny bedroom they share in a ground floor flat, 13-year-old Lauren Fick is trying to finish her homework on her bed, as her two older brothers rub shoulders at the computer. \n\nThey are all relieved that the shooting outside has, for now, subsided. But their mother, Susan, is not convinced it will last. She also has a nagging suspicion that the gangs are being treated too kindly - the bar set too low.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where you stay, you can still bring your kids up properly. It all depends on the parents and what they're going to do about their kids,\"she said firmly. Beside her, the children nod in agreement.\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by Helen Zille - the premier of the Western Cape province and head of South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.\n\n\"To suggest that people who are unemployed or poor become gangsters is a kind of insult to people who are unemployed or poor. There are billions of people all over the world who are unemployed or poor and who are not gangsters and who do not murder other people,\"said Ms Zille, who blames dysfunctional families, a long history of gang rivalries and above all the drugs trade for the enduring violence on the Cape Flats. \n\nRaids\n\nThe next day I am sitting in the back of a van with heavily armed members of the police's\"gang team\", on the way to the first of three drug raids. \n\n\"These houses - we hit'em hard,\"said one of the officers, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. He said the unit had lost two men in the past month - one caught in crossfire in a similar operation, the other ambushed by a gang wanting to steal his gun.\n\nOver the course of the next two hours the officers, backed up by an eager and effective sniffer dog called Luke, made two arrests. They also confiscated several small caches of methamphetamines and marijuana, and brought in two heavily tattooed gang members for questioning.\n\n\"You can read their bodies - he's a hit man,\"said one officer, lifting the shirt of a dazed-looking 25-year-old man to reveal two pistols tattooed on his chest.\n\nThe police insist the constant raids are having a significant impact on the drugs business. \n\nBut on the short journey between two operations, one of the officers put it more bluntly:\"We're making a difference. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think that.\"\n\n\"But the kids here grow up with the idea that when they're older they're going to be a drug dealer. So we're basically trying to cut the head off a snake - but the body is so damned long, it's unbelievable.\"\nTL;DR: It is an uncomfortable meeting.

At the time there were numerous reports of Turkish atrocities committed against the Armenians.\n\nThe tragedy is in the news again after the US House of Representatives voted to recognise it as genocide. Turkey condemned the vote as a meaningless political step.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThere is general agreement that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died when the Ottoman Turks deported them en masse from eastern Anatolia to the Syrian desert and elsewhere in 1915-16. They were killed or died from starvation or disease.\n\nThe total number of Armenian dead is disputed. Armenians say 1.5 million died. The Republic of Turkey estimates the total to be 300,000.\n\nAccording to the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), the death toll was\"more than a million\". \n\nIn a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2005, the IAGS said\"we want to underscore that it is not just Armenians who are affirming the Armenian Genocide but it is the overwhelming opinion of scholars who study genocide\".\n\nWhat is genocide?\n\nArticle Two of the UN Convention on Genocide of December 1948 describes genocide as carrying out acts intended\"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\".\n\nWere the killings systematic?\n\nThe dispute about whether it was genocide centres on the question of premeditation - the degree to which the killings were orchestrated.\n\nMany historians, governments and the Armenian people believe that they were; but a number of scholars question this.\n\nRaphael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the term\"genocide\"in 1943, referred to the atrocities against Armenians as well as the Nazi massacres of Jews when describing his investigations.\n\nTurkish officials accept that atrocities were committed but argue that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people. Turkey says many innocent Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of war.\n\nWhat was the political context?\n\nThe Young Turks - an officers' movement that had seized power in 1908 - launched a series of measures against Armenians as the Ottoman Empire was crumbling through military defeats in the war. The Young Turks - calling themselves the Committee of Unity and Progress (CUP) - had entered the war on Germany's side in 1914.\n\nTurkish propaganda at the time presented the Armenians as saboteurs and a pro-Russian\"fifth column\".\n\nArmenians mark the date 24 April 1915 as the start of what they regard as the genocide. That was when the Ottoman government arrested about 50 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. They were later executed.\n\nArmenians in the Ottoman army were disarmed and killed. Armenian property was confiscated.\n\nWas anyone held to account?\n\nSeveral senior Ottoman officials were put on trial in Turkey in 1919-20 in connection with the atrocities. A local governor, Mehmed Kemal, was found guilty and hanged for the mass killing of Armenians in the central Anatolian district of Yozgat. The Young Turks' top triumvirate - the\"Three Pashas\"- had already fled abroad. They were sentenced to death in absentia.\n\nHistorians have questioned the judicial procedures at these trials, the quality of the evidence presented and the degree to which the Turkish authorities may have wished to appease the victorious Allies.\n\nWho recognises it as genocide and who does not?\n\nArgentina, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Portugal, Russia and Uruguay are among more than 20 countries which have formally recognised genocide against the Armenians.\n\nThe European Parliament and the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities have also done so.\n\nThe UK, US and Israel are among those that use different terminology to describe the events.\n\nTurkey reacted angrily after Pope Francis called it\"the first genocide of the 20th Century\"in the run-up to the centenary commemorations.\n\nTurkey recalled its Vatican ambassador and accused the Pope of having\"discriminated about people's suffering\". The Pope\"overlooked atrocities that Turks and Muslims suffered in World War One and only highlighted the Christian suffering, especially that of the Armenian people\", the Turkish foreign ministry said. \n\nIn October 2019, Turkey called the vote in the US House of Representatives  to recognise the killings as genocide\"null and void\", saying it was revenge for the controversial military operation it was carrying out against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. It summoned the US ambassador to Ankara to complain.\n\nIt was the first time in decades that the full House had considered such a measure. In the past, attempts were thwarted by concerns that it could damage relations with Turkey, a Nato ally, and intense lobbying by the Turkish government.\n\nIn 2006, Turkey condemned a French parliamentary vote which would make it a crime to deny that Armenians had suffered genocide. The bill did not become law - but Turkey suspended military ties.\n\nIn December 2011, some MPs in France's ruling centre-right party, the UMP, revived the bill, despite Turkish government outrage. It was approved by the upper house, the Senate, on 23 January 2012 but was later struck down by France's highest judicial body, the Constitutional Council. \n\nWhat is the political impact of the row?\n\nThe killings are regarded as the seminal event of modern Armenian history, binding the diaspora together. Armenians are one of the world's most dispersed peoples.\n\nIn Turkey, public debate on the issue has been stifled. Article 301 of the penal code, on\"insulting Turkishness\", has been used to prosecute prominent writers who highlight the mass killings of Armenians. \n\nAmong them were Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and Hrant Dink, who was later shot dead in January 2007. A teenage ultra-nationalist, Ogun Samast, was jailed for nearly 23 years in July 2011 for murdering Dink, a Turkish-Armenian who edited a bilingual newspaper.\n\nThe European Union has said Turkish acceptance of the Armenian genocide is not a condition for Turkey's entry into the bloc.\n\nAre Armenia-Turkey relations still frosty?\n\nAfter decades of hostility there has been a slight thaw. Turkey and Armenia signed a deal in October 2009 to establish diplomatic relations and open their border.\n\nBut the deal is yet to be ratified by either parliament, and some in Ankara accuse Armenia of trying to alter the terms of the deal.\n\nA complicating factor is mutual suspicion over the frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey backs Azerbaijan in the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory inside Azerbaijan held by ethnic Armenians since a war in the 1990s.\n\nCorrection July 2008: This article has been amended following a ruling by the BBC Trust.\nTL;DR: The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One remains a highly sensitive issue.\n\nArticle: Laurna Woods said the buyout of Beattie Communications marked the start of a\"new journey\"for the company.\n\nGordon Beattie stood down this week as chairman after he posted on LinkedIn that the company did not hire\"blacks, gays or Catholics\".\n\nHe later said he was\"truly sorry\"for his\"inappropriate\"language.\n\nThe LinkedIn post, which was uploaded last week, provoked an angry reaction from anti-racism campaigners and was also strongly criticised by others in the communications industry.\n\nThe buyout will see Ms Woods and her leadership team take over the London-headquartered firm, which includes offices in Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Belfast.\n\nMr Beattie will not have any involvement in the new business and the consultancy will rebrand and change its name in the near future.\n\n'Dynamic new agency'\n\nMs Woods said:\"I will be dedicating all my efforts into building a dynamic new agency that is leading in every respect, from the services we provide to the culture we live by.\n\n\"We are fully committed to becoming game-changers in the creative industry and an employer that continues to be equal to all. \n\n\"This will be felt through every touchpoint in our business - from the work we produce to the talent we recruit.\n\n\"This buyout will secure the success of a thriving, client-focused business.

it seemed like the wrong thing to do.\"\n\nBut measurements of the temperatures of the tree trunks showed that, on days as hot as 39C, they were up to seven degrees cooler than the air. \n\n\"That's what made us wonder if the koalas were using the trees as a heat sink,\"said Dr Kearney. \n\nThe team used a thermal camera to take pictures of koalas on a particularly hot day. \n\n\"When we got the images, back it was so obvious what the koala was doing,\"explained Dr Kearney.\"You could see the koala sitting on the coolest part of the tree trunk with its bottom wedged right into the coolest spot.\n\n\"If we had thermal vision, it would have been an obvious thing.\"\n\nDeadly heat \n\nDr Kearney said large trees had their own protective\"microclimate\", which is likely to become increasingly important to tree-dwelling creatures like koalas if global temperatures continue to increase as predicted. \n\nAnother researcher who has used thermal cameras in his ecological research - Dr Justin Welbergen from James Cook University - says thermal images show exactly how animals can exploit these cooler microclimates in trees. \n\n\"This helps them to maximise their chances of survival during extreme heat events,\"He told BBC News.  \n\nResearch Dr Welbergen published earlier this year revealed the effects on wildlife of such extreme events. His research revealed that 45,500 flying foxes had died on just one extremely hot day in southeast Queensland.\n\n\"Our thermal video shows group of flying-foxes trying to cope with an extreme heat event by distributing saliva on their wings,\"he explained. \n\nHugging trees, Dr Kearney said, helps the koalas to avoid similar water loss - enabling them to\"dump heat\"into the tree and to avoid panting.\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\nTL;DR: Hugging trees helps koalas to keep cool, a study has revealed.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan HeadBBC News, South East Asia correspondent\n\nOn Friday the independent news website Malaysiakini was found guilty of contempt. It now has to pay a hefty fine of RM500,000 (\u00a388,500, $123,600). Its editor-in-chief and co-founder Steven Gan narrowly escaped a prison sentence after he was found not guilty for a similar charge. \n\nThe attorney-general filed the charges last year based on readers' critical comments about the judiciary posted on Malaysiakini's website, and later removed, a move with worrying implications for all news media. \n\nMalaysiakini's success so far, its very survival, are all the more remarkable in a country where all news media was once subject to government control, and in a region where truly independent, quality journalism is difficult, dangerous and often driven to the margins.  \n\nBack in 1999 Steven Gan and Pramesh Chandran saw an opportunity to create Asia's first online daily news site.\n\nThey were both former student activists who worked at Malaysia's The Sun newspaper, and had grown frustrated by official censorship through the requirement to have a licence to publish, and through extensive ownership of mainstream media outlets by pro-government interest groups. \n\n\"I was a believer in media freedom, yet we saw its limits in Malaysia every day we worked as journalists\", he told the BBC in an interview before the verdict.\n\nThe catalyst was the dramatic dismissal and then arrest of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in September 1998, a popular figure seen until then as the designated successor to then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who had been in office for 17 years and dominated Malaysian politics. \n\nIt was the start of an epic tussle for power between the two men which would last many years. Steven recalls that several journalists discussed using the then new medium of the internet to report what other media would not. \n\n\"We realised we could do it for quite a low cost, that, unlike print, we did not need a licence, and Mahathir had already promised foreign investors that he would not censor the internet,\"he said.\n\n\"The internet was very new at that time - you know, we used 56k modems, it was really slow.\n\n\"People were really interested in political issues then because of the sacking of Anwar Ibrahim, and we rode on that wave of political awakening. The mainstream media was not reporting what was happening on the ground, especially if there was something like a mass protest in Kuala Lumpur, so they were going to the internet.\"\n\nBased in the suburban district of Petaling Jaya, Malaysiakini started with just three journalists, initially hoping to fund themselves through partnership with an internet caf\u00e9, then with advertising from internet start-ups during what was then the dotcom boom. It was fortunate to receive a $100,000 grant from the Bangkok-based South East Asia Press Alliance. \n\nIt survived the failure of the caf\u00e9, the dotcom bust, and outright hostility from the government, with the Prime Minister accusing Malaysiakini journalists in 2001 of behaving like traitors, and barring them from official press conferences. \n\nOver the years it has endured several police raids, threatened criminal charges and prosecutions. Throughout, said Steven Gan, they insisted their reporters maintain high standards of journalism. \n\n\"We are new media but we practise old media rules,\"he said. \n\nBut perhaps the most important decision was an early focus on finding a viable business model for the site, long before other mainstream media had started to question theirs in the digital era.\n\n\"We knew we needed to offer a website with reliable information, and we needed to make a political impact,\"he says.\n\n\"But just as important is to have a good business model. You need to have a good editor-in chief, and also a good CEO who can look after the business side of things.

It has been an inspiration to other Malaysian journalists, like Jahabar Siddique, a former Reuters employee, who founded another independent news site, The Malaysian Insider.\n\n\"It made it viable for journalists to consider options beyond the muzzled media that was available then. Also made it possible for those like me who were working for international media agencies to consider returning to the local media scene and expand the free space available to inform Malaysians and others about Malaysia.\"\n\nMaria Ressa, a former CNN and ABS-CBN journalist who founded the website Rappler in the Philippines in 2012, and now finds herself subjected to several criminal prosecutions under the hostile media climate of the Duterte administration, credits Malaysiakini for showing that a small, independent news organisation could succeed in South East Asia.\n\n\"They were the first to embrace a digital platform, and the first to come up with a workable business model for online news. What was so great about Malaysiakini was that from the start they set themselves high standards of journalism, and when faced with pressure from the government, they did not buckle. They never gave up.\"\n\nOn the day of his release from second spell in prison in 2018, Anwar Ibrahim thanked Malaysiakini for ensuring dissenting voices were heard.\"You have done a wonderful job. At a time when we had massive restrictions, where the media was nothing but incessant propaganda, Malaysiakini was there.\"\n\nMalaysiakini has been favoured by a less repressive environment than in many neighbouring countries, and a more favourable economic one. \n\nThere is a large and educated middle class in Malaysia, not just keen to read alternative views but to pay subscriptions, or to donate, as they did when the news site needed a new office seven years ago and offered a wall of 1,000 bricks to donors willing to give RM1,000 (\u00a3188) a brick. \n\nIt has created successful subsidiary businesses, like its advertising arm, which has steadily driven up commercial income. But its real achievement, says Professor Zaharom Nain at Nottingham University's Malaysia Campus, is broadening the political debate in Malaysian society.\n\n\"It has, I believe, provided Malaysians with a different way of interpreting Malaysia's politics. It has also paved the way for other news portals to emerge and develop. It has even made mainstream media move to another platform, utilising the internet, for getting their message across,\"he says. \n\n\"Beyond providing dissenting news, Malaysiakini has shown many Malaysians that there is more than one point of view, and that it is legitimate to question authority.\"\n\nToday Steven Gan is not alone in finding himself subject to criminal investigation.\n\nLast year six journalists from Al Jazeera were questioned by police over a report on the alleged mistreatment of migrants in Malaysia during Covid-19, on suspicion of violating three laws. Two other journalists were also investigated for their reporting. \n\nFollowing the collapse of the reformist government headed by Mahathir Mohamad after his comeback in the 2018 election, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin now heads a precarious coalition pulled together last March.\n\nMr Muhyiddin's government is proving less tolerant of critical reporting than its predecessor in what is now a more heated and less predictable political climate.\nTL;DR: Tucked away in an unremarkable business park in a suburban district of the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is the headquarters of a remarkable experiment in journalism. It has come under attack.\n\nArticle: By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent\n\nUniversities Minister Jo Johnson said he wanted\"tough action\"against the spread of plagiarism and the commercial industry it has spawned.\n\nThe Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) said hundreds of\"essay mills\"were charging up to \u00a36,750 for writing a PhD dissertation.\n\nMr Johnson said it could\"undermine\"the reputation of degrees from the UK.\n\n\"Essay mills are a major challenge for universities and colleges,\"said the QAA's Ian Kimber. \n\n\"Because, unlike other forms of cheating, the practice is notoriously difficult to detect.\"\n\nTougher penalties\n\nLast summer the QAA, which monitors standards in higher education, published a report into the scale of such commercial plagiarism.\n\nIt found essay services with charges - depending on length, complexity and speed of turnaround - from \u00a315 to thousands of pounds.\n\nMany claimed to produce customised work that was\"100% plagiarism free\".\n\nThe watchdog said it was difficult to estimate how widely such services were being used.\n\nThere were about 17,000 cases a year of\"academic offences\", it said, but there was no breakdown of how many of these involved students who had used essay writing services.\n\nEssay-writing websites often carry disclaimers suggesting the essays being sold should be used only as examples and not passed off as students' own work.\n\nThe universities minister wants a more co-ordinated response to the problem.\n\nMr Johnson is asking the standards watchdog to take action against essay mills advertising their services to students.\n\nHe also wants stronger guidance for students, including\"tough new penalties for those who make use of essay mills websites\".\n\n\"This form of cheating is unacceptable, and every university should have strong policies and sanctions in place to detect and deal with it,\"said Mr Johnson. \n\n\"Essay mill websites threaten to undermine the high quality reputation of a UK degree, so it is vital that the sector works together to address this in a consistent and robust way.\"\n\nDame Julia Goodfellow, president of Universities UK, said:\"Universities have severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own. \n\n\"Such academic misconduct is a breach of an institution's disciplinary regulations and can result in students, in serious cases, being expelled from the university.\"\n\nThis has been a longstanding problem - and a decade ago Google announced that it would stop running adverts from essay writing services, but such businesses can still be found through online searches.\nTL;DR: The universities watchdog is being asked to pursue websites advertising essay-writing services for students.\n\nArticle: By Dan MacadamBusiness reporter\n\nAbout 1,500 check-in staff, baggage handlers and cargo crew at a number of UK airports have also called a 48-hour strike from 23 December in a pay row.\n\nIn addition, some cabin crew at British Airways have called walkouts, while Argos delivery drivers this week suspended a strike at the eleventh hour.\n\nThe unrest is all the more unusual because for the last 30 years strikes have been falling to record low levels in the UK.\n\n\"We've not seen much strike action really since the mid-1980s,\"says Dr Alf Crossman, an industrial relations specialist at the University of Sussex.\n\n\"Back then it was the great British disease. It was like the weather - something you put up with.\"\n\nThe number and size of walkouts has dropped sharply since the days of the Miners' Strike in 1984-85 and the Winter of Discontent in the late 1970s.\n\nIn comparison, last year the number of working days lost through strikes - 170,000 - was the second lowest on record. \n\n\"The level of action now pales into insignificance compared to the Winter of Discontent in 1978-79,\"says Prof Gregor Gall from the University of Bradford.\n\nThen, a wave of crippling strikes spread across the country, leading ultimately to the collapse of the Labour government and the election of Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\"It's so difficult to draw real comparisons because so much has changed,\"agrees Dr Crossman.\n\nBefore the Thatcher administration, trade unions were more powerful, while the railways, British Airways and Royal Mail were all state-owned. \n\n\"We would not be talking about a Southern rail strike, it would be a nationwide rail strike,\"says Dr Crossman.\n\nBut there are also some parallels, experts say, such as stagnant wages for some workers, inflation edging back up, and the first fully Conservative government in almost 20 years.\n\n\"It feels like there's an undercurrent of discontent building,\"says Andy Cook, chief executive of Marshall-James, which advises firms on industrial relations. \n\n\"People are feeling the pinch,\"he says.\"Average workers feel they're not being paid in line with profits and therefore are more willing to stand up.\"\n\nThe pre-Christmas 2016 strikes\n\nSouthern rail \n\nWhen? Friday 16 December, Monday 19 December to Tuesday 20 December \n\nWhy? Unions say the dispute is about safety, but Southern and the government say it is political\n\nPost Office\n\nWhen? Crown Post Office workers on Monday 19 December, Tuesday 20 December, and Saturday 24 December. Delivery drivers to rural Post Offices on Thursday 22 December and Friday 23 December\n\nWhy? Jobs, pensions and branch closures at Crown Post Offices - the larger branches usually located on High Streets\n\nBritish Airways\n\nWhen? Sunday 25 December to Monday 26 December\n\nWhy? Pay for about 4,000 staff who joined after 2010 on\"Mixed Fleet\"contracts\n\nUK airport staff\n\nWhen? Friday 23 December to Saturday 24 December\n\nWhy? A longstanding pay dispute - the Unite union says wages have not kept up with inflation\n\nTrade unions are at pains to point out that all of these strikes are separate.\n\n\"The causes of recent strikes differ from strike to strike, ranging from safety on the railways to closures of post offices. Each dispute is specific to that workplace,\"says Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC trade union body. \n\n\"Going on strike is always a last resort, especially for the hardworking staff who take pride in their work, and will lose pay while on strike,\"she adds.\n\nOf the four strikes, only the British Airways one and the airport workers one are explicitly about pay. \n\nStill, the level of industrial unrest is on the rise. The number of working days lost to strikes in the first 10 months of 2016 has already passed last year's total, largely because of the junior doctors' strike in April and the teachers' strike in July.\n\nThe unions do seem to be\"flexing their muscles\", Dr Crossman says.\n\nIn the background, there's also the Labour Party's closer relationship with trade unions under Jeremy Corbyn, and the implications of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey standing for re-election. \n\nCompanies are also less experienced at handling strikes, says Dr Crossman.\"In 30 years of relative industrial peace, management have forgotten how to deal with industrial relations.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Christmas walkouts, unions have to weigh the risk of negative publicity against the stronger bargaining position, particularly in sectors like travel and mail delivery where people rely on them more than usual.\n\nWith the Argos delivery drivers, the threat of strikes helped secure a pay deal - an example of the leverage trade unions can hold in the festive period.\n\n\"Would it have got traction if it was in August? Probably not,\"says Mr Cook.\n\nAt least the possible disruption to mail deliveries, and yet more delays for commuters on Southern, is due to industrial tensions and not the weather. \n\nThe unrest during the Winter of Discontent was exacerbated by blizzards and deep snow.\n\nAnd with weather forecasts this year looking milder, that seems a more remote prospect for the Christmas of Discontent.\nTL;DR: With commuters on Southern rail services facing yet another day of strikes, and Crown Post Office workers pushing ahead with walkouts, are we facing a Christmas of Discontent?\n\nArticle: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor\n\nThe screens of the Galaxy S8 and bigger S8+ are also larger despite the devices being about the same size as last year's S7 and S7 Edge.\n\nThis time, both models feature displays that curve round the phones' sides.\n\nThe launch follows Samsung's botched release of the Note 7, which was recalled twice after fires.\n\nThe South Korean firm blamed the problem on battery faults and said it had since put in additional safety measures, including X-ray scans of  batteries.\n\nThe company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country.\n\n\"The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\"commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy.\n\n\"The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.\"\n\nThe new devices will be released on 21 April. \n\nThe S8 is priced at \u00a3690 and the S8+ at \u00a3780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of \u00a3569 for the S7 and \u00a3639 for the S7 Edge.\n\nSamsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC. \n\nHowever, Apple overtook it in the final three months.\n\nSource: IDC\n\nLonger screens\n\nThe displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets.\n\nAs a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG.\n\nA pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback.\n\nSamsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard.\n\nThe screens are the same resolution as before but are now brighter, supporting high dynamic range (HDR) playback of videos for extra clarity.\n\nThe S8's body is a little narrower than that of the S7, while the S8+'s is a bit wider than the S7 Edge but lighter - Samsung says both new devices can still be used one-handed.\n\nHello Bixby\n\nThe phones also introduce Bixby - a virtual assistant based on technology acquired from some of the original developers' of Apple's Siri.\n\nThe helper is activated by a dedicated side-button and allows 10 built-in apps - including a photo gallery, messages and weather - to be controlled by voice.\n\nIt is\"context-aware\", meaning users can ask follow-up questions and assume it is aware of what is currently displayed.\n\nSamsung said it expected owners to mix together voice commands and physical controls - for example asking to see all the photos taken today, then tapping the ones they want, before verbally requesting they be messaged to a friend.\n\nThe software can also be used to recognise objects seen via the phone's camera. This can be used to identify a landmark, for example, or tell the owner how much a product would cost to buy online.\n\nBixby works with Google Play Music, and Samsung intends to open it up to other third-party apps in the future but has not said when.\n\nAt launch, it is only designed to recognise US and Korean voices.\n\n\"If what Samsung demoed works well in practice, Bixby will be interesting because it offers features absent from Siri and Google Assistant,\"commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC.\n\n\"The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales.\n\n\"But in the past, some of Samsung's features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.\"\n\nWhile Bixby offers new ways to control a phone, it lacks Google Assistant's pre-emptive smarts - it does not interject in chats to suggest places to visit, for example. \n\nHowever, the search giant's rival artificial intelligence can still be summoned via the home button.\n\nEnhanced cameras\n\nOther improvements over last year's models include:\n\nSamsung also has a range of accessories including a revamped virtual reality headset that is now accompanied by its own motion-sensing controller, and a second-generation 360-degree camera capable of more detailed images than before.\n\nIt also offers a new dock that connects the phones to a monitor, keyboard and wireless mouse, allowing them to act as a kind of Android-powered PC.\n\n\"Although Microsoft has done this in the past, the performance of the S8 makes it a very compelling experience,\"commented Mr Wood.\n\n\"But while I'm impressed with the dock from a technology perspective, the practicality of it for consumers is questionable.\"\n\nAnalysis: Zoe Kleinman, technology reporter\n\nI'm not sure I share Samsung's bold declaration that the S8 is\"a work of art\"- but the slimmer handset definitely sits more easily in one hand than its predecessor.\n\nAnd once you see the surface, which is nearly all-screen, you wonder why you ever needed a physical home button or any other furniture around it.\n\nThe tech giant has high hopes for its digital assistant Bixby. What I tried was a limited demo model, which only seemed to understand a few predetermined cues such as searching photos and telling you the weather.\n\nThe idea of using the camera as Bixby's\"eyes\"is neat - but is it enough to draw people away from the more familiar Google Assistant, which will also be preinstalled, as it is on other Android devices?\n\nI'd like to be able to tell you more about the battery life of what I imagine is a power-hungry little device - but Samsung was coy about that.

Even if he is convicted by the Vatican City Court, he will not be sent to prison until an appeal takes place, which could take months.\n\nMr Gabriele, a 46-year-old father of three who worked his way up in the Pope's domain from a cleaner's job to the post of butler, valet and sometimes - if we are to believe him - close confidant of the pontiff, spent nearly two months in a police cell and just over another two months under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of aggravated theft.\n\nHe appeared in court smartly dressed in a pale grey suit and answered the presiding judge's questions on the second day of the trial precisely and fully.\n\nFrom the evidence before the court, the butler emerges as a rather devout Catholic believer who until this year was regarded by the small community of men and women who make up the papal household as totally trustworthy. He kept the keys to the papal apartments, and had access to the entire top floor of the Apostolic Palace where Pope Benedict lives, sleeps and takes his meals. \n\nWhen the Pope travelled, Mr Gabriele was seated in the Popemobile beside the driver. When it rained he held a white umbrella to prevent the Pope from getting wet. He was the Pope's shadow, the layman with closest access to the pontiff.\n\nHis position afforded him considerable prestige inside the Vatican where he still lives with his family in a modest\"grace-and-favour\"apartment only four minutes walk from his job.\n\nTension in court\n\nHe told the court that because of the\"evangelical imprint\"of his duties, he felt obliged to help other Vatican employees who did not enjoy the privilege of such close contact with the pontiff. He said he was often waylayed on his short walk back home by colleagues asking him to hand in a petition or a letter to the Pope because of the privileged position he enjoyed inside the Pope's immediate entourage.  \n\nSometimes, he said, he would ask for a driver to take him directly back home to avoid the embarrassment of having to refuse such favours.\n\nMr Gabriele's body language in court sometimes betrayed tension, and when Monsignor Gaenswein - Pope Benedict's private secretary and his immediate superior - was giving evidence, the two mens' eyes never met. \n\nThe butler sprang to attention both as Monsignor Gaenswein entered and exited the small wood-panelled courtroom. The secretary had been the first to confront Mr Gabriele with the accusation that he was the person who had been leaking confidential Vatican documents to the Italian media.\n\nWhat the trial has not revealed so far is the real motive behind Mr Gabriele's apparent betrayal of the Pope's confidence, nor whether any Vatican senior clerics were involved in the most serious internal security breach suffered by the Holy See in living memory. \n\nVatican police officers gave evidence that when they searched Mr Gabriele's study in his home, they found one large cupboard stacked from floor to ceiling with a disorderly jumble of documents taken from the Pope's office over a period of years. \n\nThe documents included original letters initialled by the Pope indicating that he had read them personally, many photocopies, flash sticks and computer disks, and the results of thousands of internet searches on such varied subjects as Freemasonry, espionage, secret agents, yoga and Buddhism. Police said the material seized from Mr Gabriele's home filled 82 cardboard boxes of a size typically used by house movers.\n\nThe Vatican decided early on to speed up the criminal proceedings by reducing the accusations against the butler to a single charge of\"aggravated theft\". Originally, the prosecutor had raised other possible charges of conspiracy, crimes against the Vatican City State, defamation and revealing state secrets (all Vatican employees are required to swear an oath of secrecy regarding everything they see and learn in the course of their duties).\n\nAfter the defence and prosecution have made their summing up on Saturday morning, the three judges will retire to consider their verdict and pass sentence.\nTL;DR: Five months after his arrest on charges of stealing thousands of pages of secret correspondence and documents from Pope Benedict's private office in the Vatican, his former manservant Paolo Gabriele is about to learn his fate.\n\nArticle: By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to kill Soleimani removes one of the most obdurate and effective enemies of the US, and delivers a blow to the heart of the Islamic republic of Iran.

It recorded 1,690 new cases in the latest daily count on Wednesday, bringing the country's total to almost 330,000.\n\nGalicia's smoking ban was announced in a news conference on Wednesday after experts recommended the measure to the regional government.\n\nThe move is supported by health ministry research, published last month, that outlined the link between smoking and the increased spread of coronavirus. \n\nIt said the risk was heightened because people project droplets - and potentially Covid-19 - when they exhale smoke.\n\nIt also said smokers risked infection in other ways, such as by touching their cigarette before bringing it to their mouth and by handling face masks when taking them on and off.\n\nThe research also pointed to the wider negative health effects of smoking.\"It has been proven that tobacco use, in any of its forms, worsens the course of respiratory diseases,\"it said. \n\n\"Current evidence indicates that smoking is associated with... a higher risk of developing a severe form of symptoms,\"it added.\n\n\"Smoking with no limits... with people close by and without any social distancing [poses] a high risk of infection,\"regional President Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o told the news conference.\n\n\"We know that this is an unpopular measure for smokers,\"added Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Villar, a member of the clinical committee advising government, according to the El Pa\u00eds newspaper.\"But I believe we are in an exceptional situation.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Canary Islands announced a similar measure and banned smoking outdoors where social distancing cannot be guaranteed. It will come into force on Friday alongside another order that makes face masks mandatory in public spaces.\n\nOfficials in areas including Madrid, Andalusia and Valencia are also reported to be considering implementing smoking restrictions of their own.\n\nSimilar measures have been imposed elsewhere, such as in South Africa where the sale of tobacco was banned at the end of March. \n\nIt justified the ban on health grounds based on advice from its own medical experts as well as from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAnd in the UK, a survey showed that more than one million people had given up smoking since the Covid-19 pandemic hit. UK government advice says smokers may be at risk of more severe Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nDoctors say smokers are more likely to get respiratory infections, and are more likely to develop complications such as pneumonia at a later stage.\nTL;DR: The Spanish region of Galicia has effectively banned smoking in public places over concerns it increases the risk of Covid-19 transmission.\n\nArticle: By Hugh MilesBBC Radio 4 The Report\n\nSir Howard visited Libya to advise the regime about financial reforms and accepted a \u00a3300,000 donation from the Libyan leader's second son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi for research at the LSE.\n\nHis departure underlines just how politically toxic links with the Gaddafi regime have become ever since it began its brutal suppression of the Libyan uprising.\n\n Saif al-Islam's former friends and business associates in the west have become embarrassed to admit ever knowing him now his reputation as a liberal reformer has been scuttled.\n\nYet just a few weeks ago Saif was socialising with the creme de la creme of British society. \n\nSo how did so many respectable people get it so wrong? \n\nIn part this is because Saif makes such a good impression in the media. Tall and handsome, he speaks fluent English and presented himself as the acceptable face of the Gaddafi regime.\n\nWith few exceptions, he sided with the reformers in Libya and seemed prepared to go head-to-head with his father in an attempt to develop the fledgling Libyan private sector and open up the atrophied media.\n\n'Like the Godfather'\n\nBut Saif's warm reception in influential business, academic and political circles in the West was also attributable to the eagerness in some quarters to gain access to Libya's oil wealth. \n\n\"If Libya was a country without an oil producing capacity, I don't think Saif would have convinced the West,\"said Dr Omar Ashur, a lecturer in the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter.\n\n\"Because of the interests [the West had in Libya] the moral dimension was pushed aside for a while or frozen for a while. But after what happened in Libya in the last few days I don't think this can continue anymore.\"\n\nLike the rest of Gaddafi's children, Saif lived a life of privilege and ease, although like his father he claimed to have no official position and denied having access large funds.\n\nBut now new evidence has emerged that despite his denials, Saif in fact controlled the multi-billion-pound Libyan sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). \n\n\"I've seen the Godfather. This is the closest thing in real life,\"commented a Libyan investment banker familiar with how the LIA was run.\n\n\"It is as if it is his own private farm. This was almost like a mafia operation.\"\n\n'Mother of all funds'\n\nThe ostensible purpose of the Libyan Investment Authority - known in Arabic as\"the mother of all funds\"- was to manage Libya's excess oil wealth for the benefit of future generations. \n\nIts assets were valued at around \u00a350bn to \u00a360bn ($80-100bn) and included shares in Juventus football club, Italian oil giant Eni, and Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times. \n\nSaif appointed an old college friend named Mustafa Zarti to manage the LIA on his behalf. \n\n\"Zarti wasn't made deputy chairman of the LIA because of his talent in investment.  It was out of his loyalty and proximity to Saif. Saif put him there to ensure he implements whatever investment policy was required of him,\"said the banker. \n\nThe way the LIA worked was that Saif would cut opaque business deals with his super-wealthy friends at private parties, sometimes using middle men, and then Zarti would be instructed to push them through.\n\n\"It was very much top down.  Saif would give the deals to Mustafa.  Mustafa would give them to his team. \n\n\"Obviously he never would be held accountable because he never signed anything and to best of my knowledge Mustafa didn't sign anything,\"the banker said.  \n\nBad deals\n\nMany of the deals Saif and Mustafa tried to push through made little financial sense and were met with strong objections by the staff at the LIA. \n\nSome of these bad deals fell through, including ones with Bernie Madoff and Saif's close friend Nat Rothschild, but other bad deals were done and ended up costing the LIA millions.\n\n\"The LIA was being pushed by Saif and Mustafa to invest in Rusal, a Russian aluminium company which had a lot of issues,\"said the banker. \n\n\"The deal was fought tooth and nail by the investment committee, by the board, but in the end it was done. You could say no some of the time to Saif's deals but you can't say no all of the time.\"\n\nFinancial corruption by the Gaddafi family and others linked to the regime has been one of the key drivers of the current Libyan uprising. \n\nThe LIA's funds have now been frozen under UN sanctions and on Tuesday the Austrian foreign ministry asked Austria's Central Bank to look into freezing Mustafa Zarti's Austrian assets. \n\nHis future, like the future of Saif himself, remains uncertain.\n\n\"The right place for many of the leading figures in this regime is the International Criminal Court. To prolong the life of the regime there was a very successful strategy to provide another face and that face was of Saif al-Islam, the LSE graduate, a reformist leading development,\"said Omar Ashur.\n\n\"They were people who were trying to disguise themselves as doves, but in the end they were brutally repressive figures. I don't think there are doves within the Gaddafi regime - including Saif al-Islam.\"\n\nHugh Miles is an award winning writer and broadcaster, the author of Al Jazeera - How Arab TV News Challenged the World.\n\n  You can listen to this special edition of The Report on Libya via the BBC iPlayer now or download the podcast. It will be re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 6 March at 2100 GMT.\nTL;DR: The director of the London School of Economics Sir Howard Davies has submitted his resignation after admitting an \"error of judgment\" in establishing links with the regime of Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi.\n\nArticle: The Public Accounts Committee said there had clearly been an\"emerging problem\"with official advice before it was\"belatedly\"changed in April.\n\nIt accused ministers of being slow to support social care during the crisis. \n\nThe government said it had been\"working closely\"with the sector.\n\nThe committee said around 25,000 patients were discharged into care homes in England between mid-March and mid-April to free up hospital beds. \n\nAfter initially saying a negative result was not required before discharging patients, the government later said on 15 April all patients would be tested. \n\nIn a highly critical report, the cross-party committee said the initial decision to allow untested patients into care homes was an\"appalling error\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, committee chair Meg Hillier acknowledged there had been limited data about the virus when early decisions were made; however she said there was also a long-term lack of understanding at the health department about how the care sector works.\n\n\"The fact that there are people on low pay not taking sick leave, moving from home to home were things that were risk elements - if you had better understanding of any impact of any disease on a care home you would have understood the implications,\"she said. \n\nThe committee says that, by September, the government should review which care homes took discharged patients, and how many went on to have outbreaks.\n\nIn its evidence to the committee, Public Health England said nationwide testing capacity was limited to 3,500 tests per day at the start of the crisis. \n\nThe agency added that it had agreed with the NHS and chief medical officer to prioritise testing for those in intensive care and those with respiratory illnesses, along with limited testing in care homes to detect outbreaks.\n\nHowever the committee said the policy of discharging untested patients continued\"even once it was clear there was an emerging problem\".\n\nRegular testing for staff and residents in care homes in England was rolled out earlier this month. \n\nElsewhere, the committee expressed concern about NHS use of public money when securing private hospital treatment for patients at the start of the pandemic. \n\nIt said NHS England had failed so far to provide\"even a rough estimate\"of costs, criticising an\"apparent lack of transparency\". \n\nThe MPs also said the costs of building England's Nightingale hospitals lacked transparency and\"are also not yet known\".\n\nUnder a funding package to help the NHS prepare for the winter, the temporary hospitals are due to be maintained until the end of March 2021.\n\n'Series of mistakes' \n\nShadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the report confirmed the government\"was too slow to act to protect older and disabled people\".\n\n\"A series of mistakes were made despite clear warnings from what was happening in other countries,\"the Labour MP added. \n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said it has been\"working closely with the sector and public health experts\"to develop guidance throughout the\"unprecedented global pandemic\". \n\nThe spokesman added an extra \u00a31.3bn had been given to the NHS to speed up hospital discharges, while testing had been introduced for all care home residents and staff. \n\nThis includes\"repeat testing for staff and residents in care homes for over-65 or those with dementia\", they added.\nTL;DR: The decision to allow hospital patients in England to be discharged to care homes without Covid-19 tests at the start of the pandemic has been described as \"reckless\" by MPs.\n\nArticle: That made it the most-watched five minutes of British TV since the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.\n\nWednesday's audience peaked between 21:30-21:35 BST as England tried to find an equaliser at the end of extra time in the semi-final against Croatia.\n\nBut they couldn't score, meaning Croatia won 2-1 to take them into Sunday's final against France.\n\nThe overall TV match average for the semi-final was 24.3 million, which doesn't take into account people watching in pubs or on outdoor big screens.\n\nITV said there were also a record 4.3 million requests to watch it online on ITV Hub.\n\nAbout 80% of all viewers watching TV in the UK at the time were tuned into the game. \n\nIts ratings reflected the huge interest in England's first World Cup semi-final since 1990.\n\nHowever not everyone could stand the tension and some changed channels.\n\nThe previous highest audience during this World Cup was 23.6 million for the climax of England's penalty shootout win over Colombia in the last 16.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

On Sunday, police said 50 people had been killed. However, on Monday, they changed that figure to 49, to exclude the gunman from the death toll.\n\nPresident Barack Obama did not hesitate to condemn the massacre as\"an act of terror and an act of hate\".\n\n\"This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends - our fellow Americans - who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,\"he said in an address to the nation.\"The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live.\"\n\nThe Orlando attack is a painful reminder that even though the US has made historic strides in broadening the rights of its LGBT citizens - like the legalisation of gay marriage in June 2015 - the struggle up until this point has been a difficult and sometimes violent one. \n\nSeattle's openly gay mayor Ed Murray says the struggle for equal rights has usually seen moments of progress followed by a violent reaction. \n\n\"Americans woke with the sickening, all-too-familiar feeling of fear that our community has once again been attacked. For too long, our community has been the target of violence throughout the world,\"he said.\n\nNicholas Syrett, co-chair of the Committee on LGBT History and a professor at the University of Northern Colorado, said more openness came with a cost:\n\n\"Those who still remain intransigent in their hostility and opposition to gay people, they're going to be exposed to more of them because we are increasingly able to be open.\"\n\nUntil the shooting in Orlando, the largest mass death at a gay club was the arson attack at the UpStairs Lounge in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1973. Thirty-two people died after an unknown assailant firebombed the entrance to the second-floor club, trapping people inside. \n\nLike many of the patrons at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, the revellers at the UpStairs Lounge were celebrating Pride Weekend.  \n\nIn more recent history, in 2014, a Seattle man set fire to a stairwell at a gay bar called Neighbours, claiming\"what these people are doing is wrong\". No-one was killed. \n\nIn 1997, Eric Rudolph bombed a lesbian bar in Atlanta, injuring five.\n\nMr Syrett said that while large-scale attacks on the LGBT community were not as common, there had been hundreds of individual assaults and murders, including the high-profile beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998.\n\nSimilar attacks have taken place internationally as well - in 1999, a nail bomb killed three people and injured dozens more at the Admiral Duncan pub, in the heart of London's gay community. The culprit was a right-wing extremist.\n\nThere have also been documented executions of gay people in territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State (IS). Those accused of being LGBT are thrown from the roofs of buildings or stoned to death. \n\n\"Isis [another name for IS] are also professional when it comes to tracking gay people. They hunt them down one by one,\"wrote one man who fled IS in Iraq in an essay for BBC News.\"They are trying to track down every gay man. And it's like dominoes. If one goes, the others will be taken down too.\"\n\nIn Orlando, Mateen was said to have called the emergency number 911 to pledge his allegiance to IS just before launching his attack.\n\nMark Wallace, CEO of the Counter Extremism Project, said it was difficult to know how many LGBT men and women had been killed by IS, but the practice was well documented. \n\n\"The targeting, persecution and killing of LGBT [people] in Isis-controlled territory is extensive. \n\n\"LGBT people have been suffering at the hands of extremists in various cultures and parts of the world for some time.\"\n\nThough Mr Wallace said he did not want to diminish the suffering of the gay community, he added that the attacks in Orlando were about much more than an opposition to homosexuality. \n\n\"Isis and extremist ideology hate all of us,\"he says.\"It's really an attack on all of us. It's an attack on the way we live - our openness.\"\nTL;DR: The worst mass shooting in modern American history was also a hate crime against the gay community. It's not the first time LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people have been the targets of violence.\n\nArticle: By Sandy MurrayBBC Scotland news\n\nMany of the more influential Victorians had worries about the working class.\n\nWith what little leisure time they had, those employed in the mines and factories might drink alcohol, or worse.\n\nWhat was needed was something more improving.\n\nAnd, according to historian Paul Rabbitts, bandstands were a very public part of this commitment to uplifting activity.\n\n\"Their purpose was part of what they called'ordered, rational recreation',\"says Paul.\n\n\"It was really something to get the working classes - to get them into parks and open spaces, and give them something that was much more ordered and regulated leisure and recreation.\n\n\"Basically it was to get them out of the gin palaces and the pubs.\n\n\"They saw music as being part of that, and the bandstands came out of that.\"\n\nThis attempt at social engineering created an economic legacy, with workshops in the central belt of Scotland making many of the bandstands erected across the UK and beyond.\n\n\"It was all to do with the kind of ore that was found in the hills just outside Glasgow,\"Paul says.\n\n\"The ore there was perfect for smelting and casting of iron. So what you found was you had a whole industry grow up in and around Glasgow.\n\n\"One of the very earliest foundries was Carron Ironworks near Falkirk but the biggest manufacturer of all was Walter MacFarlane and the Saracen Foundry in Possilpark in Glasgow.\n\n\"They literally cornered the market.\"\n\nPaul says MacFarlane was\"a very clever man\".\n\n\"What he did was that he was very good at marketing. \n\n\"So nowadays we take for granted the internet, and catalogues and that kind of stuff.\n\n\"He used advertising through published catalogues that showed bandstands and all the other kind of things that they cast as well.\n\n\"He marketed them nationally but also worldwide as well.\"\n\nRecent years have seen a renaissance in Britain's bandstands, with many being restored or rebuilt using lottery funding.\n\nSome, such as the one at Wilton Lodge Park in Hawick, had gone almost without trace.\n\nPaul says:\"All that was left was the remnants of the plinth, which became a flowerbed and then a fishpond and then an empty piece of open space.\n\n\"They got lottery money and put back a replica of the original Scottish bandstand back in there.\"\n\nAll images are subject to copyright.\nTL;DR: Victorian bandstands remain a popular feature in many parks and open spaces across the UK. But why were so many of them built in Scotland?\n\nArticle: An expert panel said the move was necessary to cope with the growing workload as more power is devolved.\n\nAlso, the vote would be given to 16 and 17-year-olds as part of proposals to reform the 60-member assembly.\n\nPresiding Officer Elin Jones hailed\"the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests\".\n\nThe assembly is already due to be renamed the Welsh Parliament as a result of a previous consultation. \n\nPowers for the assembly to change its electoral rules, size and other internal affairs are being granted under the 2017 Wales Act.\n\nLast week, AMs voted in favour of putting the expert panel's recommendations out to public consultation.\n\nMs Jones said:\"The Wales Act 2017 marks the start of a new phase of devolution in Wales, giving us the opportunity to make profound changes to our legislature. \n\n\"We now have the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests.\"\n\nThe panel, chaired by Prof Laura McAllister of Cardiff University, also recommended a change in the voting system, to a proportional method called the Single Transferable Vote.\n\nOne option would be to pair the current 40 constituencies to merge them into 20 seats, each with four AMs, giving a total of 80.\n\nA gender quota would boost the number of women in the Senedd, and the option of standing as a\"job share\"candidate would aim to encourage people with disabilities or caring responsibilities.\n\nAny changes will require a law to be passed in the assembly with a two-thirds majority.\n\nWhen the report was published in December, Welsh Labour said it would not give its view until its 2019 conference, which Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said\"kills dead\"any chance of reform before the next election in 2021.\n\nThe consultation is open until 6 April.\n\nIn January, the Welsh Government proposed votes for 16 and 17-year-olds in council elections as part of a package of local government reforms.\nTL;DR: People are being asked to share their view on plans to expand the Welsh Assembly by an extra 20 to 30 members.\n\nArticle: The new deadline - 31 October - averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal on Friday, as MPs are still deadlocked over a deal.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said his\"message to British friends\"was\"please do not waste this time\".\n\nTheresa May, who had wanted a shorter delay, said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible.\n\nThe UK must now hold European elections in May, or leave on 1 June without a deal.\n\nThe prime minister will later make a statement on the Brussels summit to the House of Commons, while talks with the Labour Party, aimed at reaching consensus on how to handle Brexit, are set to continue.\n\nMrs May tweeted:\"The choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest.\"\n\nSo far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year and they have voted against leaving the EU without a deal. \n\nThe EU has ruled out any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nBefore the summit, Mrs May had told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from this Friday to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if Parliament ratified her agreement.\n\nWhat is the reaction in the UK?\n\nFor Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the delay to 31 October\"a good thing\", saying businesses would be\"relieved\". \n\nHe added:\"Negotiations are in good faith. We all feel a deep sense of duty to break the impasse.\n\n\"But there's also this question of how on Earth do we ensure that anything this prime minister promises is actually delivered in the future because of course she's already said she's going to step down, probably within months.\"\n\nOne government minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the latest delay to Brexit could mean a Conservative Party leadership contest after Easter, with a new prime minister potentially in place by June. \n\nFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis said:\"There's been no progress whatsoever, really.\"\n\nHe added that it was still\"difficult to see how\"Mrs May could get her deal with the EU through Parliament and said:\"The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically now, I suspect.\"\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her\"relief\"that the UK wouldn't be\"crashing out\"on Friday, adding that\"allowing people to decide if they still want to leave is now imperative\". \n\nWhat was agreed?\n\nWhat was the EU's message?\n\nDonald Tusk emerged from the talks - and a subsequent meeting with Mrs May - to address reporters at a news conference at 02:15 local time (01:15 BST).\n\n\"The course of action will be entirely in the UK's hands,\"he said.\"They can still ratify the withdrawal agreement, in which case the extension can be terminated.\"\n\nMr Tusk said the UK could also rethink its strategy or choose to\"cancel Brexit altogether\".\n\nHe added:\"Let me finish with a message to our British friends: This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said:\"There will probably be a European election in the UK - that might seem a bit odd, but rules are rules and we must respect European law and then we will see what happens.\"\n\nWhat did Theresa May say?\n\nMrs May spoke at 02:45 local time (01:45 BST). She said that, although the delay extends until 31 October, the UK can leave before then if MPs pass her withdrawal deal.\n\n\"I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,\"she said.\"The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade Parliament to approve a deal.\"\n\nShe added:\"I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital.\"\n\nThe PM said the UK would\"continue to hold full membership rights and obligations [of the EU]\"during the delay.\n\nTrick or treat? Halloween deadline is both\n\nYou couldn't quite make it up. The new Brexit deadline is, you guessed it, Halloween.\n\nSo to get all the terrible metaphors about horror shows, ghosts and ghouls out of the way right now, let's consider straight away some of the reasons why this decision is a treat in one sense, but could be a trick too.\n\nA treat? First and most importantly, the EU has agreed to put the brakes on. We will not leave tomorrow without a deal.\n\nThe prime minister's acceptance that leaving the EU without a formal arrangement in place could be a disaster won out.\n\nAnd there are quite a few potential tricks. This new October deadline might not solve very much at all.\n\nThis could, although I hate to say it, just make way for months of extra gridlock before the UK and the EU find themselves back here in a similar situation in the autumn.\n\nRead Laura's blog here\n\nHow did the EU leaders decide?\n\nThe EU had been split over the length of delay to offer the UK, and by law its other 27 member states had to reach a unanimous decision. \n\nAlthough other countries backed a longer delay, French President Emmanuel Macron pushed for a shorter extension. He called the 31 October deadline\"a good solution\".\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said the extension gave the UK time\"to come to a cross-party agreement\".\n\nRisk of no-deal postponed\n\nFudge and can-kicking are the EU-familiar words that spring to mind at the end of this Brexit summit. \n\nAfter all the drama and speculation leading up to the meeting, effectively all that happened here is that the threat of a no-deal Brexit has been postponed for another six months.\n\nTime enough for the EU to hold European parliamentary elections, choose a new president of the European Commission and pass a new budget - without EU leaders having to keep one eye at least on the day-to-day dramas in the House of Commons. \n\nDespite EU leaders' rhetoric beforehand, they granted this extension without hearing a convincing plan of Brexit action from Theresa May. \n\nIn the summit conclusions there is no evidence of the punitive safeguards mooted to ensure the UK\"behaves itself\"- refraining from blocking EU decisions - as long as it remains a club member. \n\nYes, EU leaders worry about who might replace Theresa May as prime minister. Yes, they're concerned these six months could fly past with the UK as divided as ever but their message to the UK tonight was:\"We've done our bit. Now you do yours. It's up to you. Please use the time well.\"\nTL;DR: European Union leaders have granted the UK a six-month extension to Brexit, after late-night talks in Brussels.\n\nArticle: Mr Salmond said the programme would include guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment.\n\nIt will be produced by Mr Salmond's own Slainte Media company, which he set up with former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.  \n\nRT has been described as a Russian propaganda channel, but Mr Salmond urged viewers to judge for themselves. \n\nOn Thursday, RT - formerly known as Russia Today - confirmed it would be registering with authorities in the US as an\"agent of the Russian state\"- a description disputed by the broadcaster, which insists it has editorial independence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies\n\nAn assessment by US intelligence agencies in January stated that:\"The Kremlin staffs RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, recruiting people who can convey Russian strategic messaging because of their ideological beliefs.''\n\nBut speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Salmond said:\"Over the last year or two, 50 Labour MPs - including the current Labour Party leader - 37 Conservative MPs and 17 SNP MPs have appeared on RT programmes. \n\n\"It would be a bit strange if I said, now that I'm no longer a member of parliament, that I'm refusing to make my own show with my own production company over which I have total editorial control, which is broadcast on RT.\"\n\nThe former SNP leader added:\"It would be a great idea if people watched the show, and if it is a good show and it has high production values and has interesting guests with interesting things to say then they should say it is a good show.\n\n\"And if it turns out to be Kremlin propaganda then people can slate me, but why don't they watch the show first?\"\n\nThe TV show, which will be broadcast in the UK every Thursday from 16 November, has been inspired by Mr Salmond's recent Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, Alex Salmond Unleashed.\n\nMr Salmond, who lost his Gordon seat to the Tories in June's general election, also hosts a radio show on the London-based LBC station, and has been linked to a potential takeover of the Johnston Press group, which includes the Scotsman and the i newspapers.\n\nSpeaking a launch event in London, he said he wanted to hear from\"people of ideas and answers\"on his TV programme, and would give guests a platform to explain their ideas before facing questions.\n\nThe former first minister said:\"This programme will give people with something to say a platform to say it, and we intend to find out something about the personalities behind the public figures.\n\n\"In this show I'm going to give you the opportunity to get to know our guests just that bit better.\"\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nA spokesman for the SNP said it was\"entirely a matter for Alex Salmond\", and that he is free to take on any opportunities he wanted now he is no longer an elected politician.\n\nThe spokesman said the SNP has\"regularly expressed concern over actions by the Russian government, including reports of persecution on the grounds of race and sexuality, attacks on journalists and concerns about the integrity of the democratic process, and we will continue to pursue these concerns.\"\n\nSNP MP Douglas Chapman tweeted at BBC presenter Andrew Neil that Mr Salmond had\"probably got fed up waiting for an offer from the UK propaganda machine...you know, the one you work for.\"\n\nBut political opponents have criticised Mr Salmond, with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson tweeting:\"It's not often I feel sorry for Nicola Sturgeon, but Salmond taking the Kremlin's rouble on Russia Today?

Students and staff had baked potatoes with beans and coleslaw for lunch, with fruit for dessert. The money saved will be donated to the school's charities.\"\n\nPhotos accompanying the post included a poster for Austerity Day, showing a waiter lifting a silver cloche with three peas underneath it.\n\nMs Shah, 24, attended St Paul's from the ages of 11 to 18.\n\nShe was the first of her family to go to university when she left the school for Oxford University in 2012.\n\n\"Austerity lunch is what we ate at home. It's having to eat a jacket potatoes every day, not having one once a term,\"she said.\n\nMs Shah, from Hounslow, said raising awareness for people living in poverty was\"great\", but that the problem was using the word\"austerity\".\n\nA spokeswoman for St Paul's told the BBC:\"For many years, St Paul's has arranged regular lunches when simple food is served and the money saved given to local charities.\n\n\"The aim is also to raise the awareness of our students to those less fortunate than themselves.\n\n\"The choice of the word'austerity' is to draw attention to the fact that others around them are facing significant economic difficulties.\"\n\nThe school refused to explain why the post had been deleted.\n\n'Like Marie Antoinette'\n\nJack Monroe, a campaigner and author renowned for blogging about cooking for a family on a shoestring budget, told the BBC the stunt was\"enormously patronising\".\n\n\"I'm not outraged, I'm more saddened.

These data were consistent with water in the soil being bound to perchlorates.\n\nFinally, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument gave the researchers the content of water vapour in the atmosphere.\n\nThe results show conditions were right for the brines to form during winter nights at the Martian equator, where Curiosity landed. But the liquid evaporates during the Martian day when temperatures rise.\n\nJavier Martin-Torres, a co-investigator on the Curiosity mission and lead scientist on REMS, told BBC News the detection was indirect but convincing:\"What we see are the conditions for the formation of brines on the surface. It's similar to when people were discovering the first exoplanets.\n\n\"They were not seeing the planets, but they were able to see the gravitational effects on the star.\n\n\"These perchlorate salts have a property called deliquescence. They take the water vapour from the atmosphere and absorb it to produce the brines.\"\n\nHe added:\"We see a daily water cycle - which is very important. This cycle is maintained by the brine. On Earth we have an exchange between the atmosphere and the ground through rain. But we don't have this on Mars.\"\n\nWhile one might think that liquid water would form at warmer temperatures, the formation of brines is the result of an interaction between temperature and atmospheric pressure. It happens that the sweet spot for formation of these liquid films is at colder temperatures.\n\nThe fact that the scientists see evidence for these brines at the Martian equator - where conditions are least favourable - means that they might be more persistent at higher latitudes, in areas where the humidity is higher and temperatures are lower.\n\nIn these regions they might even be present all year round.\n\nDark streaks on slopes seen by orbiting spacecraft have long been thought to be the product of running water seeping from the Martian soil. But this interpretation has been contested.\n\n\"It's speculation at this point... but these observations at least support or go in this direction,\"said Dr Martin-Torres.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter\nTL;DR: Nasa's Curiosity rover has found that water can exist as a liquid near the Martian surface.\n\nArticle: He has also threatened to strip government contracts from firms that continue to outsource work to China.\n\nIn a speech on Monday, Mr Trump vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months saying \u201cwe will end our reliance on China.\u201d\n\nIt marks his latest attack on China, after moves that have involved tech companies TikTok, WeChat and Huawei.\n\nThe announcement came as tensions between Washington and Beijing have been escalating rapidly in recent months. \n\nThe Trump administration is now casting its net beyond the Chinese technology companies it has accused of threatening US national security. \n\n\u201cWe will create tax credits for companies that bring jobs from China back to America,\u201d Mr Trump said. \u201cWe built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now I have to do it again.\u201d\n\nChinese communications giant Huawei has repeatedly come under attack by the US government and on Monday further restrictions were placed on the company to limit the electrical components it can buy.\n\nThe Trump administration has also threatened to include more Chinese technology firms on its blacklist of companies which face bans in the US, alongside TikTok and WeChat, \n\nAs November's US presidential election approaches, Mr Trump has upped the ante in targeting China, accusing its companies of stealing American jobs and intellectual property.\n\nIn Monday's speech, Mr Trump added that \u201cwe will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States.\u201d\n\nAmerican icons\n\nMany well-known US products are made overseas for American consumers, a business strategy known as outsourcing.\n\nAmerica\u2019s most valuable public company, Apple, uses a Taiwanese firm called Foxconn to make the majority of its best-selling iPhones.

The northeast monsoon has been particularly vigorous over southern India and more so in Tamil Nadu state, of which Chennai is the capital.\n\nLast month was the wettest November in a century in the city of 4.3 million people. And, at 490 mm, rainfall on 1 December was the  highest in 100 years. \n\nThe floods are a wake up call for India's teeming cities that were built with the expectation that the environment would adjust itself to accommodate the need for the city to grow. \n\nDisconnect\n\nThe disconnect with nature is also manifest in the failure of planners, builders, administrators and even common people to fathom the sheer power of natural events. \n\nThe Corporation of Chennai and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority are responsible for approving building plans and town planning, and for enforcing urban planning. A masterplan was prepared in 2008.\n\nBut much of the city has grown without a plan and with no regard to water flows, and without anticipating extreme weather events. \n\nThen there's illegal construction. \n\nAs The Indian Express newspaper reports,\"What may have been a tank, lake, canal or river 20 years ago is today the site of multi-storey residential and industrial structures.\"\n\nThere are more than 150,000 illegal structures in the city, according to the city's municipality. More than 300 tanks, canals and lakes have disappeared. \n\nAn information technology park in Chennai is flooded because it is located at a place where waters from two separate lakes converge and flow to a neighbouring creek. Many of the city's info-tech facilities are built on marshlands, water-bodies and water courses. \n\nThe city's famous automobile manufacturing hubs are located in the catchment area of lakes. \n\nCampus tree-felling\n\nI was part of a campaign that accused the premier engineering school IIT Madras of clearing more than 52 acres of forest, including 8,000 trees, between 2001 and 2013, as part of a major building spree that saw 39 renovation projects and new construction take place on its campus adjoining a national park.\n\nFollowing a government order exempting educational institutions from needing to obtain clearance for construction activities, the National Green Tribunal last January rejected a petition to stop construction of new buildings on the campus - but restrained the institute from felling trees without permission, as required under Indian law. \n\nPlastics are another culprit. After the first intense downpour in mid-November, discarded plastic washed into rivers by rainwater was pushed to sea by the swollen rivers. \n\nAt high-tide, the plastic was thrown right back onto the city's beaches by the sea. The large quantity of plastics visible in the city's beach litter exposed another chink in the city's defences. \n\nPlastics are virtually indestructible. What doesn't get washed out to sea tends to accumulate in water channels and storm water and sewage networks, impeding and even blocking flows. \n\nClearly, indiscriminate development and shoddy urban planning have contributed to the floods in India's fourth most populous city. \n\nNityanand Jayaraman is a Chennai-based writer and social activist\n\nCorrection 12 January 2016: This report has been amended to clarify the author's involvement in an environmental campaign and to include a subsequent development in the case.\nTL;DR: The severe flooding in Chennai again proves that India's cities are unprepared for extreme weather events like rains, droughts and cyclonic storms which are becoming more frequent and intense.\n\nArticle: The Northamptonshire elections were due to take in May but have been put on hold while a consultation on a new local government structure takes place.\n\nThe county council is projected to overspend by \u00a330m this financial year.\n\nCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire said polls\"would involve significant costs that would be hard to justify\".\n\nNorthamptonshire County Council has a deficit of up to \u00a370m on its \u00a3435m budget for 2018-19.\n\nThe government has just taken over the council's children's services department amid concerns those in its care were at\"potential risk\"and social workers were\"overwhelmed\".\n\nIn a written statement, Mr Brokenshire said elections were important as the\"foundation of local democracy\".\n\nBut he said until a decision had been made on the future structure of local government no elections should be held.\n\nEight councils in Northamptonshire are now to offer suggestions for a new structure by 25 January.\n\nOptions include replacing the two-tier county and district structure with two unitary authorities. \n\nMr Brokenshire said it was possible councillors\"would serve for only one year with their council then being abolished\"if the elections took place.\n\n\"Elections in such circumstances risk confusing voters and would involve significant costs that would be hard to justify,\"he said.\n\nThe leader of Wellingborough Borough Council, Martin Griffiths, said work already been done on ideas for the restructure and this would be\"stepped up\".\n\nJonathan Nunn, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said:\"Given the tight timescales we have continued with our work on unitary councils, and so it's good to now have certainty that things are progressing in Westminster.\" \n\nMr Brokenshire also issued the first report by commissioners appointed this year to run the county council.\n\nIt confirmed the council's budget deficit of up to \u00a370m would be cleared using capital receipts from the sale of assets to balance the books.\n\nBut because of a projected overspend of \u00a330m in 2018/19 all non-essential spending was being frozen.\n\nOnly identified\"core services\"will be funded and money controlled by finance officers overseen by appointed outside monitors.\n\n\"We are confident that the sum of these measures will deliver considerable savings,\"the commissioners' report said.\n\nAnalysis: Unprecedented financial move\n\nBy Tom Barton, political reporter \n\nThe news that the government is to allow Northamptonshire County Council to use \u00a370m of savings, normally reserved for capital projects such as buildings and infrastructure, is unprecedented.   \n\nThe move will allow the council to pay back some of last year's \u00a335m overspend and give it a real chance of balancing its books this coming year. \n\nOther councils facing extreme financial pressure will be watching this development with interest, and many will hope they will be allowed to do the same thing. \n\nIn reality, that it is highly unlikely, since accounting rules normally forbid the switching of money between capital and revenue funds.

The bride and groom were among those feared dead.\n\nThe full extent of the region's death toll is not clear.\n\nOn Saturday, Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, told local media that\"close to 100 lives\"had been lost.\n\nHowever, local media reported that up to 120 people in the state had been killed in the floods, including at least 14 killed by landslides.\n\nMr Abdullah said that the army had been requisitioned to help in rescue efforts.\n\n\"Now that the rain has eased, we hope that water levels will start going down,\"he said.\n\nHouses levelled\n\nMore than 2,000 people have been marooned by the floods and required rescue in the past five days, the Times of India newspaper reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad Kamal, a spokesman for Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, said that 100 people had died in Pakistani-administered Kashmir when the roofs of their homes collapsed.\n\nForty people were killed by the floods in Pakistan's Punjab province alone, Dawn newspaper reported.\n\nMuch of the city of Lahore was submerged by floods, with houses levelled by the rain, the newspaper added.\n\nPakistan regularly witnesses severe floods during monsoon season.\nTL;DR: More than 200 people have been killed in flooding caused by heavy rain across large swathes of India and Pakistan, reports say.\n\nArticle: Police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally. \n\nActivists and police have clashed over the past 11 weeks, but this weekend's protest remained peaceful.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a controversial extradition bill, which has since been suspended.\n\nThey have now morphed into a broader movement demanding democratic reform and an investigation into alleged police brutality.\n\nThe protest's organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, were denied authorisation for a march through the city, but police allowed a pre-approved demonstration in the city's Victoria Park.\n\nOne of the marchers, named as Mr Wong, told the BBC's Lam Cho Wai at the scene:\"We have been fighting for more than two months, but our government has no response at all. We could just come out again and again.\"\n\nLarge crowds also marched in the nearby areas of Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Wan Chai in defiance of the police ban.\n\nA spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that although the demonstrations were generally peaceful, they had seriously affected traffic and caused much inconvenience.\n\nHe added that it was\"most important to restore social order as soon as possible\".\n\nReinvigorated faith in the cause\n\nStephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong\n\nThe push to drive Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement in a more peaceful direction this weekend seems to have worked.\n\nFrom toddlers to the elderly, protesters turned out to join a massive rally. Entire families were seen dressed in black getting soaked together when the heavens opened and driving rain struck the city.\n\nThese demonstrations wanted to draw again on a wide pool of public support after shocking images of escalating violence here caused many to rethink the direction of the pro-democracy push.\n\nWhen it was announced inside an already full Victoria Park that underground train stations had been closed because too many people were flooding in trying to reach the rally, there was a huge cheer from the crowd.\n\nToday has reinvigorated people's faith in this cause and, at the moment, made it feel like a decent proportion of this city's population are preparing to keep fighting right up to 2047, when Hong Kong is due to lose its special status and become a Chinese city like all others.\n\nHow have recent protests unfolded?\n\nThe violence has intensified in the past few weeks, and police have frequently fired tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nLast weekend activists occupied the airport, leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled. There were further clashes with police on Tuesday.\n\nThe turmoil has plunged one of Asia's leading financial centres into crisis. Many businesses remained closed on Sunday amid fears of further violence.\n\nWhat is Beijing saying?\n\nThe Chinese government hardened its rhetoric following the airport unrest, condemning it as\"behaviour that is close to terrorism\".\n\nIt was the second time in a week that Chinese officials had publicly likened the protests to terrorist activity.\n\nSome observers believe that the repeated use of such language suggests that China is losing patience with the protesters and signals that an intervention by Beijing is increasingly likely.\n\nThousands of armed police have been stationed across the border in Shenzhen. \n\n\"If Hong Kong's situation deteriorates to a point uncontrollable by the Hong Kong government, the central government will not sit by and watch,\"Chen Wen of the Chinese embassy in London told BBC Radio 4.\n\n\"We have enough powers and enough solutions to quell any unrest within the limit of basic law.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that if China were to carry out a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the protesters, it would make a trade deal between Washington and Beijing\"a very hard thing to do\".  \n\nWhat is the movement about?\n\nIt was sparked by a bill that would allow extradition from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland.\n\nCritics argue that the proposal would undermine the territory's judicial independence and could be used to target those who speak out against the Chinese government.\n\nThe former British colony has a special status, with its own legal system and judiciary, and rights and freedoms not seen in mainland China. \n\nThe bill - announced by the government in February - was suspended following mass rallies in June. But the protesters want it withdrawn altogether.\n\nTheir current demands are:\n\nSome also want the resignation of Carrie Lam, the current chief executive, whom they view as a puppet of Beijing.\n\nMore background on the protests\n\nWhat questions do you have about Hong Kong?

This does require the NHS to reorganise but it will deliver improved outcomes for patients and considerable cost savings to the NHS. \n\n\"It is also clear there were multiple failings across the health service in the lead-up to this tragedy, and the behaviour of each responsible part of the NHS in evading and obfuscating justice is appalling, and piled even more distress on an already distraught family. This requires further investigation and action taken to ensure it cannot be repeated.\n\n\"This tragedy demonstrates, once again, the devastation eating disorders can cause.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital said:\"We met Averil's family in 2014 to offer our sincere condolences for their sad and devastating loss. \n\n\"Since then we have taken into account the learning from this tragic event and our structure and processes have been reviewed.\"\n\nA spokesman for Cambridge University Hospital said:\"The trust would like to repeat the apologies previously made to Averil Hart's family and accepts the findings and recommendations in the ombudsman's report. \n\n\"When Averil was transferred to Addenbrooke's in December 2012, she was already very unwell but her death, at that time, may have been avoided had failures in her care not taken place. \n\n\"A thorough investigation has been carried out, lessons have been learned from what happened to Averil and a number of changes made.\"\n\nThe Norfolk Community Eating Disorder unit, which was tasked with providing community care to Miss Hart, has been approached for comment but is yet to respond.\n\nThe University of East Anglia declined to comment on the report, claiming it had\"been informed that legal action is pending subject to the outcome of an inquest\".\nTL;DR: A teenager who \"starved to death\" in a matter of weeks was failed by \"every NHS organisation that should have cared for her\", a review has found.\n\nArticle: By Del CrookesNewsbeat reporter\n\nThe Isle of Wight music festival has teamed up with the video sharing website to show acts such as Florence + The Machine as they appear on stage.\n\nOther bands on the stream will include The xx, Friendly Fires, Two Door Cinema Club, Emeli Sande, Bat For Lashes, Orbital, Miike Snow and Azealia Banks.\n\nThe event runs between 6-9 September at Robin Hill Country Park.\n\nBestival curator and Radio 1 DJ Rob da Bank said:\"I've been watching festivals such as Coachella and Tomorrowland on YouTube and loving the futuristic new angle on showing festivals in a different light via a medium that nearly everyone in the music and festival worlds is tuned in to.\"\n\n'Pioneering'\n\nAfter the event songs will be available on demand for 90 days on YouTube.\n\nBen Turner, a director of Bestival, said:\"Following our pioneering coverage in 3D last year, Bestival is proud to now be the first UK festival to live stream to YouTube.\n\n\"This type of music and festival is being underserved by mainstream TV in the UK and we believe that it's an important step forward for music coverage overall.\n\n\"We also believe this approach is reflective of how today's audiences want to consume music at home.\"\n\nBestival was first held in 2004. \n\nThis year's fancy dress theme is wildlife and there is a new performance area this year.\n\nThe Amphitheatre will feature music, comedy, theatre and poetry.\nTL;DR: Bestival is set to become the first UK festival to be streamed live on YouTube, its organisers have announced.\n\nArticle: Farmers will sell a lamb or ewe and donate the profits to help families in difficult circumstances due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns.\n\nFarmer Iwan Pughe Jones set up the appeal to help people struggling with health issues and losing work.\n\nHe was inspired by Rashford's bid to ensure children in England receive free school meals during the holidays.\n\nHe pitched the idea to raise money at a Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) Zoom meeting and livestock sales, auctions and cattle markets agreed to help.\n\nMr Pughe Jones said:''Farmers in the meeting were moved when they heard of the hardship.\n\n\"Families were having to make difficult choices of turning off heating and electricity to the point that they had to justify turning the oven on to cook food for their families for a certain period of time, as they did not have the money to cover the cost, let alone offer their loved ones presents for Christmas day.\n\n\"I was inspired by the effort of Marcus Rashford.

And over the last 20 years I've gone from being based in a newsroom and on location to working more and more from home.\n\nAs my mobility has decreased - walking with a stick, then two crutches, now a walker and sometimes a wheelchair - so my need for technology to help me to work has increased.\n\nAlways adapting. Always reinventing.\n\nThis has worked well. But I always felt a bit off the radar and, dare I say it, even forgotten about.\n\nWell, that's the downside of working remotely I guess: you tend to feel a bit remote.\n\nMaking a mess\n\nI arrange all my stories and interviews, go out to do the filming with my cameraman, and then come home to record my voice later. \n\nI have software that means I can record straight onto my phone from a suitable room. \n\nIn my case that's my son's bedroom - as long as the curtains are shut and there are enough blankets and duvets around to ensure the sound is acceptable.\n\nIt's not nine-year-old Matthew making a mess of his room - it's his mother!\n\nI can also look through the interviews and pictures in my kitchen and choose the best shots and clips. \n\nI then edit remotely with me sitting at home... and my editor and producer sitting in the newsroom. And no-one can tell that's how it was done when the piece is broadcast.\n\nI hardly ever go into the newsroom. I stay in contact by phone but I definitely feel a bit remote. I avoid going to meetings in Glasgow or Edinburgh. The travel would be too exhausting and debilitating for me.\n\nSo remote working can be done. For several years I have been quietly making it work on a VERY small scale.\n\nThis new normal has been my old normal for several years.\n\nAnd now everyone is adapting and reinventing.\n\nImagine presenting a radio programme from your attic? Or broadcasting a TV show from your living room?\n\nUnthinkable. Until now.\n\nBut this new normal unfortunately has some extra conditions for me.\n\nI have been told my condition and the treatment I'm receiving mean I have to be shielded.\n\nSo from now on I'll be adapting, reinventing... and concentrating on surviving.\nTL;DR: Adapting and reinventing have been part of my working life for many years.\n\nArticle: But with the Taliban currently refusing to hold direct talks with Afghan officials, and negotiations relating to\"unsolved matters\"still to continue, what has actually been agreed during the meetings in Qatar?\n\nSecunder Kermani, the BBC's Afghanistan correspondent, and senior Afghan journalist Sami Yousafzai, look at what we know so far about the talks, and what it could mean for the future of the country and the foreign forces operating there.\n\nHow significant were the talks?\n\nBoth the Taliban and US officials have said\"progress\"was made in the latest set of talks in Qatar, and despite continuing violence on the ground in Afghanistan, there seems to be a growing momentum to the peace negotiations. \n\nLeading analyst Ahmed Rashid told the BBC the talks were\"enormously significant\"and that\"we've never been as close\u2026 to an end to the civil war in Afghanistan\".\n\nThe talks lasted for six days - longer than any of the other previous set of discussions that have been held during recent months. \n\nIn the middle of the talks last week, the Taliban announced one of the group's founding members, Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader, would be appointed the new head of the Taliban's political office in Qatar, after recently being released from detention by Pakistani authorities.\n\nMr Rashid said Mullah Barader\"had a record of wanting peace and stability\"and could help persuade grassroots members to accept any deal that is reached.\n\nWhat was discussed? \n\nThe\"progress\"made seems to relate to two key issues: \n\nA senior Taliban official who attended the talks told the BBC that both sides had agreed to form two committees to draw up detailed plans on how to implement agreements in principle on these topics. \n\nThe Taliban leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committees would\"identify routes for the withdrawal, and how much time is needed. We suggested six months, but are flexible\". \n\nHe said the committees would also produce concrete proposals on how the Taliban can sever any links to al-Qaeda, and would start work within the next week. The Taliban source added that another meeting with the US would likely take place in early February.\n\nAnother source in the Taliban told the BBC that once an agreement had been drawn up, they would attempt to get other countries or international organisations to act as guarantors for it. \n\nWhat about a ceasefire?\n\nBoth sides have said further talks are necessary to resolve outstanding issues. \n\nWhat remains unclear is how a ceasefire fits into current discussions. The Taliban position seems to be one that can only be declared once a withdrawal date for international forces has been agreed. \n\nA separate high ranking Taliban official suggested that the group was nervous about agreeing to a ceasefire before having established a firm settlement, as it could be difficult to convince grassroots fighters to take up arms again, after having laid them down. \n\nThe other crucial issue is when the Taliban will agree to begin talking directly to the Afghan government. The Taliban official said the\"committees\"due to be established would also produce recommendations on this.\n\nSo far, the insurgents have only engaged with the US, dismissing the administration of President Ashraf Ghani as\"puppets.\"\n\nWhat's the Afghan government's view?\n\nIn pointed comments at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland earlier this week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said 45,000 members of the Afghan security forces had lost their lives since he took office in 2014. \n\n\"It shows who is doing the fighting,\"he said.\n\nWhen asked about the progress of talks in Qatar, President Ghani responded tersely that the aim of the meetings was\"to bring the Afghan government and the Taliban into face-to-face discussions and negotiations... then, the larger issues of the US presence and other international issues will be addressed\". \n\nMany analysts have interpreted those comments as revealing a concern amongst Afghan authorities that they are being excluded from the discussions amidst the rush to bring the conflict to an end. US President Donald Trump is believed to be growing increasingly frustrated by the continued US presence in the country. \n\nZalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation who has led talks for the American side, seemed aware of these concerns when he tweeted he was travelling to Kabul to brief President Ghani and said that any deal\"must include an intra-Afghan dialogue.\"\n\nThe discussions between the Afghan government and the Taliban are likely to be even more complicated and delicate than the discussions that have been held so far. \n\nThey would have to include agreements on the role of women's rights and democracy in an Afghanistan where the ultra-conservative Taliban are a significant part of the political mainstream. \n\nWhat happened in previous peace talks?\n\nPrevious attempts at peace have failed in their early stages. \n\nIn 2015, talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban in Pakistan broke down after news emerged of the death of the Taliban leader Mullah Omar - with whose authority the Taliban team was supposedly meeting. \n\nWhilst in 2013, talks in Qatar were cancelled when the then Afghan President Hamid Karzai was angered by the presence of a Taliban flag at the group's offices in Qatar, and felt his authority was being undermined.\nTL;DR: The \"significant progress\" said to have been made during six days of talks between US officials and the Afghan Taliban suggests that both sides are serious about trying to find a peaceful solution to a 17-year conflict that has scarred Afghanistan.\n\nArticle: Kerry Boyd, 21, took up the full-time role in April 2014, a year after Kent's first youth commissioner resigned over comments she posted on Twitter.\n\nBut just two months later she was being investigated amid reports of a relationship with a married man.\n\nShe said being in the media spotlight had led her to\"suffer from anxiety\".\n\nMs Boyd had been working with Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes but was forced to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship with a former county councillor were investigated.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC South East, Ms Boyd, from Margate, said:\"Having gone through that and hit so low where you just don't recognise who you are anymore, to then go through the recovery process, actually helped me to understand and empathise more with young people as to what difficulties they're facing.\"\n\nShe said she had also managed to use the experience\"as a tipping point to turn her life around a bit more\".\n\n\"They [Ms Barnes' office] referred me to the welfare department where I got eight months counselling. \n\n\"That professional help was very helpful,\"Ms Boyd said.\n\nShe added that learning to cope with the pressures of the job had made her stronger.\nTL;DR: Kent's former youth police and crime commissioner has revealed that stories published about her private life forced her to seek counselling.\n\nArticle: The teenager was welcomed by chants of\"Greta, Greta\"as she addressed some 15,000 people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate (BYS4C) event. \n\nShe accused politicians and the media of ignoring the climate emergency and\"sweeping their mess under the rug\". \n\n\"We are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not,\"the Swedish environmentalist said.\n\nGreta was speaking at the climate strike event on College Green, before leading a march through the city.\n\n\"Activism works so I'm telling you to act,\"she said.\"We are being betrayed by those in power.\"\n\nWet weather failed to deter thousands of people turning out for the 17-year-old, who appeared on stage at about 11:45 GMT. \n\n\"Our leaders behave like children so it falls to us to be the adults in the room. They are failing us but we will not back down,\"Greta told the crowds. \n\n\"It should not be this way but we have to tell the uncomfortable truth. They sweep their mess under the rug and ask children to clean up for them.\n\n\"This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power.\n\n\"Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials.\n\n\"So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.\"\n\nGreta walked at the front of the crowds behind a green banner reading Skolstrejk for Klimatet, which translates from Swedish as School Strike for Climate.\n\nProtesters of all ages, including youngsters dressed as the activist, waved flags, placards and banners throughout the march. \n\nAnnie, a 21-year-old Bristol University student, was of the many people who turned out to hear the headline speaker and took a day off from her studies to participate. \n\n\"This is probably one of the most important things that we should be focussing on right now. Showing support and that you want change will make people higher up realise that as well.\n\n\"One day off school is a good enough sacrifice for what this is standing for.

Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself.\"\n\nA fall in US growth this year to 1.6%, down from the previous 2.2% forecast, will be offset by increases in countries including Japan, Germany and Russia and India, the IMF said.\n\nEconomists for Brexit, a group of eight influential economists which supported the Leave campaign ahead of the EU referendum, criticised the IMF's forecasts arguing their pre-Brexit forecasts had already been proven wrong.\n\n\"The IMF, together with countless other institutions, forecasted a state of Armageddon which hasn't even come close to materialising in the UK,\"said Graeme Leach, member of Economists for Brexit and chief executive of Macronomics.\n\nHe added:\"The UK economy seems to be strengthening, not weakening. Just today, construction PMI was positive, ahead of many gloomy forecasts. \n\n\"Consumer spending is strong, with retail sales up 6% and car sales also growing.\"\n\nThe group said it still expects the UK to grow 2.6% this year and next, unchanged from its pre-referendum forecast.\n\nPattern of underperformance\n\nThe indifferent economic recovery after the global financial crisis has been a persistent theme in the Fund's regular World Economic Outlook reports. \n\nThe latest report warns of the danger of a pattern of underperformance becoming entrenched. \n\nWeak growth can lead to lower investment, slower productivity growth and the erosion of what the IMF calls\"human capital\"- which means skills and expertise. \n\n'Fraying consensus'\n\nThe UK referendum result highlights wider trends in developed economies, the IMF says. \n\n\"The Brexit vote and the ongoing US presidential election campaign have highlighted a fraying consensus about the benefits of cross-border economic integration,\"the report says.\n\nThe US reference is about the hostility to international trade agreements such as NAFTA, which involves the US, Canada and Mexico,) voiced in the election campaign. \n\nThe Republican candidate Donald Trump has been the most vocal, though not the only voice expressing such views.  \n\nIt is a political trend that has the IMF worried. It argues that an environment hostile to trade would make it harder for commodity exporters and poorer countries to develop new lines of exports. Such a trend would also undermine productivity growth and the spread of knowledge and technology. \n\nMr Obstfeld says:\"It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration. Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy's current doldrums.\"\n\nIn one important area - China - the IMF's concerns have eased somewhat in the short term. Growth has been stable, allaying fears that China's widely reported economic slowdown would be much more abrupt than it has been. \n\nHowever, there is a warning about the country's longer-term prospects and the debt burden faced by many businesses.\n\n\"A still-rising credit-to-GDP ratio and lack of decisive progress in addressing corporate debt and governance concerns in state-owned enterprises raise the risk of a disruptive adjustment,\"the IMF says. \n\nThat could have important international implications especially for commodity and machinery exporters, for which China is a vital market.\nTL;DR: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for UK economic growth next year as it warned that the global recovery remains \"weak and precarious\".\n\nArticle: Fire crews found the body of the 34-year-old when they entered the flat after tackling the fire in Green Lane, Hadfield.\n\nThey were alerted after getting reports a smoke alarm was going off at the property.\n\nFirefighters used breathing apparatus discovered the body after they and police were called out at about 07:33 BST.\n\nThe man's family have been told, but formal identification has yet to take place, a Derbyshire Police spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Our thoughts and sympathy go to the family and friends of the deceased at this distressing time,\"she said.\n\nA joint police and fire investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

And while Mr Biden has defended the economic record of his then-boss President Barack Obama, there are plenty on his team who wish the US had done more.\n\nThis time, Mr Biden's initial economic agenda is Covid. \n\nAs he enters office, the pandemic is still raging, thousands are dying every day, and jobless numbers are going up. Health is wealth, in terms of fully reopening the economy. \n\n'America Rescue Plan'\n\nMr Biden outlined last week what he called his\"America Rescue Plan\"- a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) effort to fund universal vaccination and more coronavirus testing, and provide funds for households, business and lower levels of government. \n\nMore than half of the figure is earmarked for direct financial relief for families, including $1,400 stimulus cheques for most households, as well as significantly increasing and extending unemployment benefits for millions of jobless Americans. \n\nThe plan also includes raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and childcare funding.\n\nBut this is just a plan - and turning it into reality will mark the first test of the very thin control Mr Biden's party allies hold over Congress.\n\nMr Biden is going to try to win support from Republicans, but they are wary of the price tag. The left of his party, meanwhile, want the stimulus to be even bigger. \n\nIf Mr Biden succeeds, the prize for the economy is a possible growth rate in 2021 not seen since the Reagan era - at 5% or 6%.\n\nThe constraint on his plans is the massive government debt he has inherited, due in part to the economic collapse and the $4tn in stimulus the US has already approved.\n\nBut is it a constraint? \n\n'Act big'\n\nMr Biden's choice as Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said that borrowing rates are likely to stay low for a long time, and as the former head of America's central bank, Ms Yellen has some authority on the issue. \n\nThe US is unlikely to follow the eurozone down the road of negative interest rates, which means finding alternative ways to support the economy.\n\nThe whole administration seems to be behind the mantra that borrowing cheaply to spend is not just possible but opportune, necessary and essential. \n\nAs Ms Yellen put it herself during her confirmation hearing:\"Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.\"\n\nTo Mr Biden, that means substantial spending on green energy and jobs, as indeed is being argued in almost every country in the world. \n\nThe US government will now be helping to fund the long-term economic transformation spurred by climate change, as embodied by Mr Biden's plan to re-join the Paris accords on climate change as one of his very first acts. \n\nGlobal re-engagement\n\nSo, is Mr Biden decisively turning his back on the steady and targeted erosion of the multilateral system under President Trump? Mostly, yes, but not entirely.\n\nUS antipathy towards China and attempts to contain its rise will continue in the Biden era. \n\nBut the Biden administration will not extend such Trumpian mercantilism to democratic allies.\n\nFor example, the Trump trade agenda systematically dismantled the functioning of the World Trade Organization and viewed the European Union as practicing similarly unfair trade protections. \n\nPresident Biden and team are likely to see the EU as strategic allies, even though eyebrows have been raised about the fast-track investment deal done by the EU with China, just before Biden's inauguration. \n\nThe UK government sees opportunities here, with the G7 meeting in Cornwall, chaired by Boris Johnson, expanded into a D10 of democracies with India, Australia and South Korea. \n\nSome though not all of the attendees are concerned about China's strategic influence over technology, manufacturing, the internet, and global investment and development via its\"Belt and Road\"initiative.\n\nThe other interesting global challenge could be the tech companies themselves. \n\nPresident Trump defended the US giants from efforts to tax them on sales. But Mr Biden might try to address some of the concerns about these global mega-monopolies, particularly as regards to their role in inadvertently cultivating political division and extremism.\n\nThe big picture here though is a president in fiscal rescue mode, and a team haunted by the fear that it fell short in 2009.\n\nThey are determined not to repeat that mistake.\nTL;DR: As was the case 12 years ago, Joe Biden enters the White House on an economic rescue mission after an historic US and global recession.\n\nArticle: The clip, which was apparently recorded during a Skype conversation, is also thought to show him exposing himself.\n\nThe actor has played Arthur\"Fatboy\"Chubb in the BBC One show since 2010.\n\n\"Ricky Norwood has been suspended from the show for a period of two months with immediate effect,\"said an EastEnders spokeswoman.\n\nShe added:\"In addition, Ricky would like to apologise to EastEnders' viewers for any offence caused and for bringing the show into disrepute.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old studied dance at performance arts school before he decided to take up acting.\n\nNow a full time cast member in EastEnders, Norwood first appeared in the soap's online spin-off E20.\n\nIn 2010, he won a National Television Award for best newcomer after joining EastEnders earlier that year. \n\nHis latest storyline has seen him comforting Dot Cotton, who is played by June Brown, following the death of her son Nick Cotton.\n\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter\nTL;DR: EastEnders actor Ricky Norwood has been suspended from the soap for two months after reports he was  shown smoking cannabis  in an online video.\n\nArticle: The five-year-old's parents released pink balloons and lanterns on Tuesday evening for their daughter who was taken by Mark Bridger on 1 October last year in Machynlleth, Powys.\n\nBridger was jailed for life for her abduction and murder at a month-long trial in May.\n\nLast week hundreds of people attended April's funeral in her hometown.\n\nApril went missing while playing outside her home.

On a foggy Tuesday morning, I'm standing in the middle of it, looking up, feeling small.\n\nThough the GBT has many research tasks, the one everyone talks about is the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. The GBT listens out for signs of communication or activity by species that are not from Earth.\n\nAnd if aliens are aware of our giant ear to the galaxy, there could be no better advert for the beauty of our planet than the town of Green Bank. \n\nFound in beautiful rural West Virginia, the town of 150 or so people is anchored by the GBT. The structure dominates the view over the countryside, but somehow does not seem to spoil it.\n\nUnique people\n\nI am not the first BBC reporter to pop in here. In fact, Green Bank is a source of constant fascination for journalists all over the world. Recently, several people in the town told me, a Japanese crew baffled everyone when it appeared to set up a game show-style challenge in the area.\n\nOutsiders come here for two reasons. One, to marvel at the science. Two, to ogle at the unique people who have chosen to live here.\n\nGreen Bank sits at the heart of the National Radio Quiet Zone, a 13,000 square mile (33,669 sq km) area where certain types of transmissions are restricted so as not to create interference to the variety of instruments set up in the hills - as well as the Green Bank Observatory, there is also Sugar Grove, a US intelligence agency outpost.\n\nFor those in the immediate vicinity of the GBT, the rules are more strict. Your mobile phone is useless here, you will not get a TV signal and you can't have strong wi-fi\u200a -\u200athough they admit this is a losing battle. Modern life is winning, gradually. And newer wi-fi standards do not interfere with the same frequencies as before.\n\nBut this relative digital isolation has meant that Green Bank has become a haven for those who feel they are quite literally allergic to electronic interference.\n\nThe condition is referred to as electromagnetic hypersensitivity disorder. Opinion is split on whether it is real, with the majority of medical opinion erring on the side that it is more psychological than physical.\n\nBut when I met with Diane Schou, one sufferer, I realised it did not matter whether the condition was\"real\"or not\u200a - \u200afor a growing number of people, modern technology has them feeling trapped. \n\nThe knock-on effects from the global recession have led to the Green Bank Telescope being on the chopping block.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is consulting right now on whether they can justify the expense of the telescope. To make things more precarious for Green Bank, other telescopes with similar abilities have been built in other parts of the world, including Chile. \n\nThe NSF is not going to just pull the rug from underneath the GBT. As it stands, funding is going to be gradually removed. Not a slow death, but rather a chance for Mr Holstine to court private investment money to keep the telescope operational.\n\nIt is working so far\u200a - \u200athe Breakthrough Listen project, backed with Silicon Valley money, is focused solely on finding other intelligent life. Over 10 years, its investors are planning to spend $100m (\u00a380.3m) on the quest. They are using the GBT as part of an effort to survey the one million stars closest to Earth.\n\nFor the locals in Green Bank, the survival of the telescope is not just about seeking ET. It is also the largest employer in the entire county.\n\nThe big questions\n\nWhen I asked Chuck and Heather Niday, who host a weekly show on the charming Allegheny Mountain Radio, whether the town would change if restrictions were lifted, they were reserved. \n\nSure, the kids would love access to Snapchat. But the fabric of the town would not be affected. It is a rural community and no amount of mobile phone signal will change the nature of this tight-knit town.\n\nIf like me you find it unfathomable that we are alone in the universe, then Green Bank is an utterly essential utility. When I asked Mr Holstine to justify the money the US government spends on the facility, he dug deep.\n\n\"How many of us have walked out into the night and looked up at the stars and stood there in wonder?\n\n\"We don't produce widgets. We don't produce something that you go to the store and buy. But we do produce education. We do produce research. We do produce answers to questions we haven't even asked  ourselves yet.\n\n\"Those questions are the basis of what it means for us to be human. That constant search is done right here every day.\"\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook.\nTL;DR: There's a town in West Virginia where there are tight restrictions on mobile signal, wifi and other parts of what most of us know as simply: modern life.

Cardiff.\n\nThe archdiocese said it was based on Catholic understanding of life.\n\nHerefordshire Council said it was\"at odds\"with the role of encouraging children to respect differences.\n\nThe programme also says men were\"created to initiate sexual relationships\"and women are to be\"receiver-responders\".\n\nFelicity Norman, Herefordshire Council's children and families cabinet member, said she had serious concerns about it, although the local authority had\"no power\"over what the archdiocese chose to teach within county schools.\n\n\"It seems to be at odds with the essential role of a school to foster caring and co-operative relations between all children and staff, to respect differences and to support and encourage children as they negotiate the difficulties of adolescence,\"she said.\n\n\"We are disturbed at the failure of the Archdiocese of Cardiff, responsible for directing its schools as to what it teaches, to respond to us over this or other matters concerning the safeguarding of children, in spite of attempts on our part to engage with them.\"\n\nWhat is the background to A Fertile Heart?\n\nStuart Wetson, head teacher of the school in Lugwardine, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service St Mary's was a Catholic school and its relationships and sex education policy was inspired by religious teachings of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nIt was acting in accordance with government guidance on relationships and sex education (RSHE) and was\"committed to providing our pupils with opportunities for broad and balanced debate on a range of issues whilst teaching distinctive faith perspectives on relationships\", he said.\n\n'Catholic values'\n\n\"We continue to review and evaluate our practice, sharing feedback from teachers, pupils and parents with the Archdiocese of Cardiff and the publishers of key resources.\"\n\nThe latest Ofsted report for the school in 2019 rated it outstanding in all areas and praised pupil development and its\"extremely effective\"safeguarding.\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 means schools cannot unlawfully discriminate against pupils because of their sex, race, disability, religion or belief or sexual orientation. \n\nLucy Whitehouse, from online sex education platform, Fumble, said it had\"never been more important\"for schools to teach pupils about sex and relationships properly. \n\n\"The government is giving schools room to be creative with it which is important, particularly for faith schools... but there needs to be clear lines about ideas of gender and LGBTQ,\"she added.\n\n\"To suggest contraception is wrong and gay and lesbian people cannot marry and must abstain from sex, everything there I would be quite happy to affirm is wrong.\n\n\"It is a backward step.. and LGBTQ pupils will be listening to that in school and it's harmful and leads to lasting damage.\"\n\nIn November, the\u00a0education secretary was asked by Labour MP Stella Creasy whether material published on the website A Fertile Heart was permitted to be used in schools according to government guidance.\n\nSchools\u00a0minister Nick Gibb said it was for schools to decide which resources they chose to support the teaching of RSHE.\n\nHe said there was clear advice for schools on choosing resources within the Department for Education's\"Plan your relationships, sex and health curriculum\", as well as the statutory RSHE.\n\n\"The department has stated that schools should not work with agencies that take extreme positions, and this should also be reflected in the school's choice of resources,\"he said.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the programme said those behind A Fertile Heart were\"sad\"to hear councillors' concerns.\n\n\"The programme A Fertile Heart contains 115 lessons that have been written in line with Catholic values and everything that Pope Francis has taught us. \n\n\"These lessons prioritise love, tolerance, human dignity and respect,\"it said.\n\nThe spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Cardiff added added that a\"well taught and high quality\"RSE was an important part of Catholic education.\n\n\"Our vision for RSE [Relationships, Sex and Health Education] is based on the Catholic understanding of the human person, of human flourishing and human relationships,\"he said.\n\n\"The most fundamental element of that understanding is the equality and inalienable dignity of all human persons, created in the image and likeness of God.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

has put a strain on the existing infrastructure.\n\nIn the US, regulators recently voted in favour of rules that are designed to uphold the principles of network neutrality.\n\nThe EU has openly backed network neutrality, but has introduced regulation that allows network providers to manage traffic on their networks, provided what they are doing is transparent. \n\nThe UK regulator Ofcom is expected to clarify its stance later this year.\n\nIn the meantime, the UK government has already said that it backs a two-speed internet.\n\nCulture minister Ed Vaizey said in November that ISPs had to be free to experiment with new charges to help pay for the expansion in internet services and infrastructure. \n\n\"This could include the evolution of a two-sided market, where consumers and content providers could choose to pay for differing levels of quality of service,\"he said. \n\nThe new offering from BT seems to be the first major step in that direction. \n\nThe service, offered by BT's wholesale division, is based on a new content distribution network built by BT that stores video content closer to the user, reducing congestion on the network and speeding up load times. \n\nBT retail - a separate division of BT - will begin to use the service to deliver BBC iPlayer content on its BT Vision TV service within the next few months. \n\n\"It will cache iPlayer content closer to customers on the network, allowing for the content to be delivered to customers in a more efficient and cost-effective way, as well as improving the overall viewing experience,\"a BT spokesperson told BBC News.  \n\n\"The Content Connect service will also be available to all UK ISPs within the same timescales.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that BT would not throttle or discriminate against other video services on the network, but did not rule out that ISPs using the network could do so. \n\n\"The treatment of content on the network - such as prioritisation of content or bandwidth throttling -  is strictly within the domain of the ISP and not the wholesale provider.\"\nTL;DR: BT has introduced a controversial service that some say could allow broadband providers to create a \"two-tier internet\".\n\nArticle: It follows criticism of the island's sanctions by Moneyval, part of the Council of Europe, in a report released last week.\n\nIt described them as not\"dissuasive and proportionate\"based on the size of the island's finance sector.\n\nHigher penalties for licensees will be limited to 10% of annual turnover.\n\nThe fines can be levied for failing to carry out checks on customers, not carrying out regular risk reviews and failing to make the disclosures necessary under Guernsey law.\n\nProposed financial penalties\n\nThe proposals compare to fines of 5,000,000 euro or 10% of the total annual turnover of a credit institution or financial institution across the European Union.\n\nIn Jersey there are three levels of fines with the highest being 8% of relevant income up to a maximum of \u00a34m.\n\nThe Policy Council, which has brought forward the proposals, said the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and Guernsey International Business Association have been involved in the development of and support the changes.\n\nThe council's report said:\"It is clearly important to be able to strike the right balance between ensuring that, on the one hand the Bailiwick's regulatory regime is underpinned by an effective and proportionate approach to enforcement, and on the other hand that firms are able to obtain the services of good quality people as directors and other officers.\"\n\nThe proposals do not address the other main criticism of the Moneyval report -
