The court ruled that continuing the pregnancy posed no immediate risk to Beatriz's life, despite her fragile health. The foetus is developing without a complete brain, a condition that almost always results in death shortly after birth. El Salvador prohibits abortions under any circumstances, citing constitutional protection of the right to life \"from the moment of conception.\" The court's decision has been met with criticism from campaigners who argue that it is \"irresponsible\" and that the judges failed to consider the severe health risks to Beatriz. Doctors who support Beatriz's case argue that the risks to her health will increase as her pregnancy advances, and that the court's decision will only worsen her condition. As a result, Beatriz's lawyers are considering moving her to a different country for treatment. Doctors who perform abortions in El Salvador face arrest and criminal charges. The court's ruling has sparked a wider debate on abortion in the country, with some judges suggesting that it is time to discuss the issue more widely. Despite the opposition, the court stood firm in its decision, citing the constitution as the basis for its ruling. The case highlights the challenges faced by women seeking abortions in El Salvador, where even in cases where the mother's life is at risk, the law prohibits termination. The case is likely to continue to generate controversy and debate in the country.  (Note: The summary is significantly shorter than the original article and maintains the same language.

As a result, people can now go outside with their household members or meet one other person while maintaining social distancing. Those living alone can also meet with someone from another household. However, they should not go to work, shop, or visit friends in their homes. This change affects around 2.5 million people, including those with severe respiratory conditions, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and solid organ transplant recipients. Some scientists have expressed concerns about the easing of lockdown rules, citing the high infection rate in England. The government's decision is based on the understanding that the virus is being better understood, allowing for more targeted advice. Those who have been shielding have expressed mixed emotions, with some feeling relieved while others are concerned about the potential risks. The government is urging the public to be cautious and follow the new guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.  Word count: 246.  Language: Formal.  Tone: Neutral.  Style: Objective.

The crop is plentiful, easy to grow, and doesn't require chemicals during production.\n\nSummary:\nThe demand for pea protein has increased significantly in recent years due to the growing preference for plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products. This surge in demand has been driven by health-conscious consumers seeking alternatives to soy and dairy. Pea protein is an attractive option because it doesn't require chemicals during production and is derived from a plentiful and easy-to-grow crop. Farmers in countries like Canada and the US are benefiting from the increased demand, which has led to a boom in pea protein production. The industry is expected to continue growing, with some predicting a 33% increase in pea protein production next year. The rise of pea protein has also caught traditional food giants off guard, with many now looking to invest in plant-based protein technology. Environmental groups support the shift towards plant-based proteins, citing the need to reduce meat consumption to combat climate change. However, global meat consumption remains a significant challenge, with the annual output of pea protein dwarfed by the global meat market. Overall, the demand for pea protein is expected to continue growing, driven by consumer preferences for healthier, more sustainable options.  Word Count: 266 words.

The RHI scheme was designed to encourage the use of renewable heating systems by subsidizing fuel costs, but it turned out that users could earn more by burning more fuel, leading to a significant increase in costs. The inquiry panel criticized the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) for not seeking enough detail from the Department of Trade and Industry (DETI) about how the \u00a325m grant would be used. The inquiry chairman, Sir Patrick Coghlin, expressed surprise that the DFP simply handed over the funds without proper oversight. The person in charge of the Northern Ireland Executive's budget process at the time, Joanne McBurney, acknowledged that not enough was done to ensure the budget for the RHI scheme was not exceeded. The inquiry's findings highlight the need for improved oversight and communication between different departments to prevent similar schemes from spiralling out of control in the future.

Five years ago, properties were evacuated as waves crashed onto the promenade. \n\nIt seems as good a place as any to take a look at what impact climate change may be having on communities.\n\nIts university is also the base for scientists who are researching the wider climate issues - and how we might adapt.\n\nAnd travel along the nearby Dyfi estuary and you find some of Wales' most important nature reserves and wildlife, which are vulnerable.\n\nAlun Williams, cabinet member for carbon management in Ceredigion, said rising sea levels were threatening its flood defences.\n\nThe local authority is trying to plan how to manage the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nStood on the shingle ridge which acts as a barrier between land and sea at Tanybwlch beach near Aberystwyth, Mr Williams said:\"The sea is overtopping this bank much more regularly than it used to - it's just a matter of time before it breaks through and moves inland.\"\n\nRising sea levels and more frequent storms mean there are fears this defence could soon be breached.\n\nIt is an example of how global warming is already affecting Wales - the country's 1,680 mile-long (2,700km) coastline is on the frontline, leaving local authorities like Ceredigion with difficult decisions to make.\n\nMr Williams highlighted one area where the waves have carried an avalanche of pebbles down into the River Ystwyth on the other side of the ridge. Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market. They require collective action and the government has a central role in making collective action possible,\"she said.", "prediction": "Wales' coastline is facing challenges due to climate change, with rising sea levels and more frequent storms threatening its defenses, wildlife habitats, and farmland.

It used to account for 12% of economic activity. Now the figure has dropped and is closer to 7%.\n\nIf the walls - and the economy - still bear the scars, there are visible changes in Sousse.  \n\nHeavily armed police officers man permanent checkpoints at access routes to tourist hotels. There are army units on patrol. Vehicles are checked at hotel gates, and guests must pass through metal detectors. \n\nTunisia is now\"100% safe\"for tourists, according to the country's Investment Minister, Fadel Abdel Kafi.  \n\n\"We improved our security a lot and we think that tourism will be coming back in the next few months,\"Mr Kafi told us. \n\n\"We have good indications for summer 2017, and we would be very happy to see British coming back to Tunisia.\"\n\n'Stricter and stronger'\n\nIn the year before the attack - which was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS) - more than 400,000 Britons visited the country. Their absence is keenly felt.  \n\n\"When will we listen to this language again?\"asked a waiter who heard a BBC team speaking English. \n\n\"We miss this so much. It sounds like poetry.\"\n\nFor now the British government is advising tourists against travel to Tunisia, in spite of the country's security upgrade.  \n\nThe co-owner of Riu Imperial Marhaba hotel - where the attack happened - admits the improvements came late.\n\nMohamed Becheur says the turning point should have been in March 2015 when 24 tourists were gunned down in the Bardo Museum in Tunis.   \n\n\"It should have been stricter and stronger, after the Bardo attack to be honest with you,\"said Mr Becheur.\n\n\"It should have been.

The plan aims to improve air quality and meet government targets by 2025.\n\nGenerated Summary:\nBristol City Council is proposing a clean air zone in the city to improve air quality and meet government targets by 2025. The plan includes banning diesel cars in a smaller area during peak hours and charging fees for taxis and high-polluting commercial vehicles. The city council aims to introduce new walking and cycling schemes and provide mitigation measures, including a scrappage scheme for older vehicles and grants for taxi and light goods vehicle owners. The proposal is set to be debated by the council cabinet on November 5th. The move is significant as it would be the first of its kind in the UK, requiring new legislation from the government. The city has twice missed government deadlines for providing details of a clean air zone, and the current proposal is an amalgamation of previous plans. The council aims to support those most affected by the plan, particularly those living in deprived communities. The plan is expected to be implemented in 2021 and will cover areas including the M32, the old city, and parts of Hotwells. \n\nNote: The generated summary adheres to the provided guidelines by being concise, accurate, coherent, and written in a neutral tone.

Janet alleges that she was abused by Alexander Gartshore, the same man suspected of Moira's murder, two years after her sister went missing. Police spoke to Janet after the incident but took no further action. In 2014, prosecutors announced that Gartshore would have faced prosecution for Moira's murder if he were still alive. The police are now conducting a final search for Moira's remains, and Janet is hopeful that her sister will be found. Alexander Gartshore, who died in 2006, was convicted of raping a babysitter in 1955. Moira's disappearance and Gartshore's conviction have left a lasting impact on Janet, who now lives in Australia and runs the Moira Anderson Foundation to support children in need. Janet's sister was a tomboy who loved magic tricks and wanted to be a missionary.

The motive behind the attack was believed to be the circulation of a mobile phone video showing the daughters laughing and smiling outside their family home. This was perceived by the stepson as an assault on the family's honour. The incident highlights the prevalence of honour killings in Pakistan, with over 900 women reported to have been killed in the name of family honour last year. The case also underscores the challenges in addressing these crimes, with low conviction rates and many perpetrators escaping justice. The incident took place in a region known for its conservative lifestyle, where women are often confined to their homes and their movements are restricted. The killings are a stark reminder of the need for greater awareness and legal reform to protect women's rights in Pakistan. The incident is reminiscent of a similar case last year where five young women and two men were reported killed after a video of them singing and dancing at a wedding was circulated. In that case, a tribal Jirga ordered the killings, but locals denied any wrongdoing. Human rights campaigners are calling for greater action to prevent such incidents and bring perpetrators to justice.

The move comes as British Gas faces intense competition in the market, having lost almost 290,000 customers last year.

The company's new digital brand aims to compete in the evolving energy supply landscape, where traditional players are struggling to adapt to changing consumer demands. The brand's final name has yet to be decided, but it is expected to be based on the British Gas X platform. Centrica's new chief executive, Chris O'Shea, has taken steps to modernize the company's operations, including cutting jobs and streamlining employee contracts. The energy market is experiencing a significant shift, with the Big Six energy suppliers losing ground to new entrants and smaller players struggling to remain profitable. The energy price cap, introduced in 2019, has also had a significant impact on energy companies, with Centrica reporting a loss of \u00a3849m in the last calendar year.

prevented the very first step towards brain cell death.\n\nThey now want to match up drugs with specific stages of the disease.\n\nExperts said it was important to find out if these drugs could work safely in humans.\n\nStatins are taken by people to reduce the risk of developing heart disease and the Cambridge research team says its work may have unearthed a potential\"neurostatin\"to ward off Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGenetically programmed worms\n\nRather than treating the symptoms of the disease, a neurostatin could be used as a preventative measure to stop the condition appearing in the first place.\n\nThe cancer drug bexarotene, for example, was found to stop the first step which leads to the death of brain cells in worms genetically programmed to develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn previous trials in humans, researchers tested the drug at a later stage of the disease to see if it would clear amyloid plaques from the brain but the trials were unsuccessful.\n\nDr Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said scientists must find out exactly how the drug works before any clinical trials.\n\n\"We will now need to see whether this new preventative approach could

assessment. The road, known as the Rest and Be Thankful, was shut on October 9 when approximately 2,500 tonnes of debris slid down the slope above the route. A further 500 tonnes came down in the following days. Bear Scotland, responsible for the road, along with Police Scotland and other teams, worked tirelessly to secure the slope, repair debris fencing, and clear the side of the road. Additional drainage measures have been installed to prevent future incidents.

A 24-hour recovery vehicle and additional patrols will be on hand to assist any road users. The community and motorists are thanked for their patience and encouraged to drive safely through the area while work is completed. The Old Military Road, which was also closed, has reopened, and motorists were diverted via the A85 during the closure.

The bacteria, which were found in a study of hospital staff, were not found in the beards of participants but in the faces of those without beards. The researchers suggest that shaving may cause micro-abrasions in the skin that allow bacteria to colonize. However, a microbiologist discovered over 100 different bacteria in the beards, including one that is commonly found in the small intestine, and found that some of the bacteria were killing other bacteria. One species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, was found to kill a drug-resistant form of E. coli.

They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population. \n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is considering an employee buyout of Kellingley and is questioning the timing of the closures. The government has offered to loan UK Coal \u00a310m to facilitate an 18-month \"managed closure\". UK Coal blames its financial problems on falling coal prices and the closure of Daw Mill Colliery in Warwickshire. The NUM is concerned that the redundancies could be premature, as the mines are performing better than expected, and is calling for the redundancies to be put on hold to allow for a rescue package to be considered. The workers are awaiting their redundancy letters and are uncertain about their future. \n\nNote: The original TL;DR was incorrect in stating that the workers were waiting for the postman to come.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.  However, younger trees (10-30 years old) are at greater risk and can succumb to the disease in just a few years.\n\nDrs Straw and Williams described BCD as a\"much more serious threat\"because the\"rate at which the disease has spread through the horse chestnut populations has shown no sign of slowing down in recent years, and it is still too early to say how many trees will be killed eventually and how many might survive\".\n\nContrary to the opinion that trees with foliage damage caused by leaf miners would be more susceptible to BCD and help accelerate its spread, Dr Straw said the decade-long study did not support such a view.\n\n\"Trees that have heavily damage foliage by the leaf miner do not get the (bleeding canker) disease more often and they do not suffer from it any more severely so we cannot see that the impact of the leaf miner is causing sufficient stress in the trees to make them more susceptible to the disease,\"he explained. \n\n\"The two organisms seem to be operating independently.\"\n\nDr Straw said Forest Research scientists had been concerned by attempts to treat horse chestnut trees with insecticides in order to curb the spread of leaf miners.\n\n\"This was based on the argument that by controlling the moth you would help stop the trees from becoming infected with bleeding canker disease,\"he added. \n\n\"What we have shown is that there is no point doing that.

Iran has vowed to avenge his death, but its options are constrained by the risk of a severe US response. The US had been tracking Soleimani for years and likely considered him a significant threat, but it is unclear if the assassination fits into a broader US strategy. Iran may choose to retaliate indirectly, using its proxy forces, but such an approach carries its own risks. The situation is precarious, and a miscalculation could lead to a bloody conflict.  The killing of Soleimani has set the stage for a potential new sequence of events in the Middle East, with the Iranian regime planning its response to his death.   The US will now be focusing on its most vulnerable deployments in the region, including a small force in Syria.  The crisis has increased the chances of a war, but neither side wants an all-out conflict.  The decision to kill Soleimani was likely made by President Trump, who believes the reward is worth the risk, but this assumption may be wrong.  Soleimani's legacy will be felt in Iran and the wider Middle East, and his death may lead to another sequence of bloody events.<|eot_id|>", "cleaned_prediction": "The US killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani has escalated tensions in the Middle East, raising fears of war between the US and Iran.

it is, rather, part of a wider effort both by spies and by those who scrutinise them to provide greater transparency about their work. \n\nAnd if any secrets do somehow slip out then the two-minute time delay on the TV feed means the outside world may well be prevented from hearing them.\n\nThe hearing is only an hour and a half long; so the level of detail will be limited.\n\nSecrets spilled\n\nEach head will want to discuss how they see the threats and explain what their organisation is doing to counter them.\n\nThe three spy chiefs are all different characters.\n\nThe chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers - often known as\"C\"rather than M - spent most of his career in the Foreign Office; so he is not a stranger to the TV cameras.\n\nAndrew Parker, from MI5, is new in the role but has been in the upper echelons of MI5 for many years.\n\nSir Iain Lobban, of GCHQ, faces the hardest task.\n\nHe has been running his agency for longer than either of the others but historically it has been the most secret and the least outward-facing.\n\nOr at least it was until the past few months, when former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began spilling its secrets, drawing its work into the spotlight as never before. \n\nThe spies have already been giving evidence to the committee in private for many years and that is where the real detail will be discussed.\n\nBut the decision was taken recently that this was no longer sufficient.\n\nThirty years ago, the intelligence agencies existed almost entirely in the dark.\n\nThere was no legal footing for them and no form of accountability - other than ministerial sign-off - until 1994.\n\nThe names of the heads of the organisations would not even have been widely known.\n\nSnooze factor\n\nThe spies began to speak in public in the 1990s in carefully controlled settings but this hearing marks a significant milestone.\n\nModern concerns such as terrorism and cyber-security are inherently more public-facing than the kind of monitoring of the Soviet Union that occupied so much time in the Cold War.\n\nPublic notions of transparency also mean the days of staying out of the limelight have gone.\n\nAmerican spy chiefs do appear before Congress publicly but the hearings can be pretty anodyne.\n\nWhen the British committee watched some recordings of their US counterparts some of them had second thoughts about going public - they feared the snooze factor might be too much.\n\nSo a key question will be how far the members of the ISC want to go in challenging the spy chiefs and giving them a hard time.\n\nThat is important because it is not just the spy chiefs who people will be watching closely.\n\nThe committee itself is also under scrutiny and this performance will be crucial in defining whether it really is capable of holding the intelligence agencies to account. \n\nIts performance in the decade after 9/11 has been criticised.\n\nA number of key controversies have swept through Britain's intelligence community - Iraq's absent weapons of mass destruction, whether the 7 July 2005 London bombings could have been prevented, and the UK's involvement in the rendition and transfer of detainees, to take the three most high-profile.\n\nBut in each of these areas, the ISC has underperformed.\n\nPatchy record\n\nThe details about Iraq came out thanks to the Butler Inquiry and now the Chilcot Inquiry -

it is, rather, part of a wider effort both by spies and by those who scrutinise them to provide greater transparency about their work. \n\nAnd if any secrets do somehow slip out then the two-minute time delay on the TV feed means the outside world may well be prevented from hearing them.\n\nThe hearing is only an hour and a half long; so the level of detail will be limited.\n\nSecrets spilled\n\nEach head will want to discuss how they see the threats and explain what their organisation is doing to counter them.\n\nThe three spy chiefs are all different characters.\n\nThe chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers - often known as\"C\"rather than M - spent most of his career in the Foreign Office; so he is not a stranger to the TV cameras.\n\nAndrew Parker, from MI5, is new in the role but has been in the upper echelons of MI5 for many years.\n\nSir Iain Lobban, of GCHQ, faces the hardest task.\n\nHe has been running his agency for longer than either of the others but historically it has been the most secret and the least outward-facing.\n\nOr at least it was until the past few months, when former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began spilling its secrets, drawing its work into the spotlight as never before. \n\nThe spies have already been giving evidence to the committee in private for many years and that is where the real detail will be discussed.\n\nBut the decision was taken recently that this was no longer sufficient.\n\nThirty years ago, the intelligence agencies existed almost entirely in the dark.\n\nThere was no legal footing for them and no form of accountability - other than ministerial sign-off - until 1994.\n\nThe names of the heads of the organisations would not even have been widely known.\n\nSnooze factor\n\nThe spies began to speak in public in the 1990s in carefully controlled settings but this hearing marks a significant milestone.\n\nModern concerns such as terrorism and cyber-security are inherently more public-facing than the kind of monitoring of the Soviet Union that occupied so much time in the Cold War.\n\nPublic notions of transparency also mean the days of staying out of the limelight have gone.\n\nAmerican spy chiefs do appear before Congress publicly but the hearings can be pretty anodyne.\n\nWhen the British committee watched some recordings of their US counterparts some of them had second thoughts about going public - they feared the snooze factor might be too much.\n\nSo a key question will be how far the members of the ISC want to go in challenging the spy chiefs and giving them a hard time.\n\nThat is important because it is not just the spy chiefs who people will be watching closely.\n\nThe committee itself is also under scrutiny and this performance will be crucial in defining whether it really is capable of holding the intelligence agencies to account. \n\nIts performance in the decade after 9/11 has been criticised.\n\nA number of key controversies have swept through Britain's intelligence community - Iraq's absent weapons of mass destruction, whether the 7 July 2005 London bombings could have been prevented, and the UK's involvement in the rendition and transfer of detainees, to take the three most high-profile.\n\nBut in each of these areas, the ISC has underperformed.\n\nPatchy record\n\nThe details about Iraq came out thanks to the Butler Inquiry and now the Chilcot Inquiry - not the ISC's own report.\n\nOn 7/7, the committee had to go back and re-report after gaps in its initial findings. \n\nAnd, on rendition, the record is also decidedly patchy.\n\nThe ISC's initial conclusions were challenged by evidence about British resident Binyam Mohamed who spent four years at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nIts findings was also called into question more recently over MI6's involvement with the transfer of two men to Libya - evidence which emerged thanks to the collapse of the Gaddafi regime rather than the oversight of the committee.\n\nThe Snowden affair has raised new questions - including about whether the committee was too quick to defend spies rather than oversee them.\n\nThe past problems were acknowledged by the committee's chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, when he took over in 2010 and a number of reforms were introduced under the Justice and Security Act.\n\nThe ISC can now demand information rather than request it and its remit has been extended formally to cover operations rather than just the management of the agencies. \n\nThe committee's investigators can go into the agencies and look for material rather than take what they are given  -

The proposed sanctions, aimed at preventing money laundering, do not deter and are not proportionate to the size of the island's finance sector, according to Moneyval. The new fines will be limited to 10% of annual turnover for failing to conduct customer checks, risk reviews, and disclosures under Guernsey law. This is compared to the EU's maximum fine of \u20ac5 million or 10% of annual turnover. The proposals have been developed with the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and International Business Association, and will be debated at the next States meeting. The changes do not address the low number of money laundering investigations and convictions in Guernsey, a main criticism of the Moneyval report. The government aims to strike a balance between effective enforcement and attracting skilled directors and officers.  I hope this meets the requirements.
