K. Rowling, to accuse the newspaper of racism.\n\n\"Well done on reducing one of the greatest sportswomen alive to racist and sexist tropes and turning a second great sportswoman into a faceless prop,\"Rowling wrote on Twitter. \n\nSome also said Knight had\"whitewashed\"Osaka, whose father is Haitian and mother Japanese. She was drawn as a white woman with blonde hair.\n\nThe cartoonist denied it was racist, saying he had intended to depict only the tennis player's\"poor behaviour\".\n\nHerald Sun editor Damon Johnston also jumped to Knight's defence, saying in a tweet that the cartoon\"rightly mocks poor behaviour by a tennis legend... Mark has the full support of everyone\".\n\nHe later shared an image of the front page, which included a series of other cartoons the newspaper was suggesting could offend the\"self-appointed censors\".\n\nIt once again provoked a reaction on social media - with many pointing to the irony of the Herald Sun having its own\"tantrum\".\n\n\"I'm genuinely embarrassed for you,\"Julie Stoddart said in a tweet, while Ken McAlpine tweeted:\"Poor little newspaper needs a hug.\"\n\nOthers, however, backed the newspaper's stance.\n\n\"This will trigger the perpetually offended,\"tweeted @RohanCT.\n\nAnother Twitter user, Paul Pellen, added:\"Outrage for the sake of outrage!

The response reflects the fact that Covid-19 has hit many businesses here more than in other parts of these islands.\"\n\nEconomy Minister Diane Dodds said that there was total funding of \u00a314.3m for the scheme.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, Mrs Dodds said she hoped it would\"make the difference\"for firms considering whether or not to keep someone on. \n\n\"We want to have pathways for young people,\"she said.\n\n\"All our information on the economic situation so far indicates that the impact will be on those who are younger, in training, and those who are on shorter term contracts.\"\n\nShe added it was important that there were routes into employment for people in Northern Ireland as the furlough scheme tapers off from next month.  \n\nEmployers will also receive \u00a33,000 for each new apprentice they recruit until 31 March 2021. \n\nMrs Dodds said that payment would cover all new apprenticeships created in the period by employers in all sectors.\n\n'25% of an apprentice's wage'\n\nInformation for employers on how they can apply for the payments is due to be announced by the department shortly.\n\nIndustry sources told BBC News NI that the new payments could amount to around 25% of an apprentice's annual wage and could encourage some firms to begin recruiting apprentices again.\n\nA similar scheme introduced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak offered firms in England \u00a32,000 for every new apprentice they hired.\n\nIn August, the government in the Republic of Ireland offered employers up to \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,677) to recruit and retain apprentices.\nTL;DR: Employers will be paid up to \u00a33,700 for each apprentice worker they train and retain under a new Department for the Economy (DfE) scheme.\n\nArticle: Yelchin, who played Pavel Chekov in the rebooted Star Trek films, died at his home in Los Angeles in June.\n\nA wrongful death lawsuit filed by his parents against Fiat Chrysler says the gear changer on his Jeep was defective.\n\nIn April, the company recalled 1.1m vehicles across the world over concerns that they could roll away after drivers exit.\n\nYelchin did not write a will before he died and left behind a $1.4m (\u00a31.06m) estate, according to court documents filed by his parents.\n\nCourt records show Victor and Irina Yelchin filed to become administrators of their son's estate on Friday.\n\nThe filing states Yelchin left behind at least $641,000 in personal property and had $731,000 in equity in his home.\n\nThe 27-year-old died when his car struck him after rolling backwards down the steep drive, pinning him against a brick postbox pillar and a security fence.\n\nThe vehicle that killed Yelchin was one of those subject to a recall because the gear shifters confused drivers, causing the vehicles to roll away unexpectedly.\n\nFiat Chrysler offered their sympathies to Yelchin's family in a statement, but said it could not comment on their plans for a lawsuit.\n\nThe company added it was speeding up its recall of the vehicle.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\nTL;DR: The parents of actor Anton Yelchin are suing the makers of his car, after it rolled downhill and killed him.\n\nArticle: Arbus, who did not begin acting until he was in his 40s, started his career as a successful fashion photographer. \n\nHe became a TV regular who appeared on several popular series, including police drama Starsky and Hutch. \n\nHe died from congestive heart failure at his home in Los Angeles on 19 April, his family confirmed.\n\n\"At 95, doctors didn't want to do surgery and Allan didn't want it at all,\"Arbus' second wife Costello told Reuters. \n\nBorn in 1918 in New York, Arbus started his career as a photographer in the US Army in Burma during World War II.\n\nIn the late 1940s, he set up a New York photography studio with his wife Diane, who later became a renowned art photographer. \n\nThe couple separated in 1959 and she committed suicide in 1971. They were portrayed by Nicole Kidman and Ty Burrell in the 2006 film Fur.\n\nArbus' first major acting role was in director Robert Downey Sr's 1972 cult film Greaser's Palace, which also starred the director's young son, Robert Downey Jr.\n\nThe MASH actor's last television role was in 2000 on the Larry David comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm.\nTL;DR: Actor Allan Arbus, best known for his role as army psychiatrist Sidney Freedman in the 1970s US TV series MASH, has died at the age of 95.\n\nArticle: Earlier in July, the county council said the Leicester Royal Infirmary (LRI) would no longer be a stop from the Enderby site as demand was too low.\n\nSome users said this would force hospital visitors to use cars.\n\nNow the NHS Trust has said its existing service between the LRI and Glenfield will stop at St Nicholas Place, the nearest park and ride halt.\n\nThe county council said the service to the LRI was part of a route which had been underused. \n\nThey added that in tough financial times they had to look at ways of saving money on the service, which last year received more than \u00a3630,000 in subsidy from the city and county councils.\n\nWhen travelling from Glenfield Hospital towards the LRI, the hopper bus will stop at St Nicholas Place. When travelling in the other direction, the bus will stop outside Jewry Wall Museum. \n\nRuth Ward, travel manager at Leicester's Hospitals, said:\"We're really pleased to be able to provide this valuable link between our hospital buses and the city's park and ride passengers.\"\nTL;DR: A bus linking Leicester's hospitals to the park and ride service has been set up just days after another was axed. \n\n\n\nArticle: Prof Annette Pritchard, director of the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said the country was\"underperforming\".\n\nMeanwhile, figures show 14 tourist information centres (TICs) in Wales have closed in the past five years.\n\nBut Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the future was digital.\n\nProf Pritchard said despite some encouraging figures, Wales was still not doing well enough in key areas, and the impact of budget cuts had seen the closure of tourist information centres across Wales at a time when the industry needed growth.\n\n\"We are not doing as well internationally as our competitors, we're getting about 3% of visitors and about 2% of spend,\"she told BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme.\n\n\"We've got about 5% of the population so really we need to be aiming for that 5% mark from the overseas tourism.\"\n\nVisit Wales spent less than Visit Scotland on marketing in 2016. \n\nThis year its budget has increased but according to Mr Skates, money is not always the answer when it comes to tourism marketing.\n\n\"Many critics will say'well you just need to spend more on newspaper adverts, more on TV adverts in order to get more visitors in',\"he said.\n\n\"Well that's not necessarily the case in the 21st century - the way to market a country, a product is to actually make sure that it captures the attention of billions of people through social media and to do that you have to have an innovative approach - you have got to have a creative approach.\"\n\nLast year, Wales attracted more than one million overseas visitors while Scotland welcomed 2.7m overseas visitors over the same period.\n\nResearch by Week in Week Out revealed a decline in the number of tourist information centres run directly by councils, with the closure of 14 in the past five years, including five in Gwynedd.\n\nTwo - Porthmadog and Caernarfon - have been taken over by North Wales Tourism, but they do not have the funds to open on a regular basis. \n\nAmbra Burls, who works at the Porthmadog centre, said:\"We've had some 3,000 people through the door here in Porthmadog alone since Easter.\n\n\"Considering we're only open at weekends between 11:00 and 15:00 - that speaks volumes really as the amount of people that would come in through the week.\"\n\nIan Spindley, marketing manager at the Royal Sportsman Hotel in Porthmadog, added:\"Each week we would probably get five guest room recommendations and referrals from the TIC and dozens and dozens of recommendations for diners to come and eat with us - and that stopped over the last 18 months when the centre was closed.\"\n\nGwynedd council said severe budget cuts had resulted in them no longer directly running TICs but added they were working with tourism groups to maintain the service. \n\nMr Skates said changing times called for a change in attitude when it came to attracting - and informing - visitors.\n\n\"We have to respect the fact that the local authority budgets are under immense pressure and so sometimes difficult decisions have to be made but we also need to make sure that the economy itself is preparing for the 21st century way of doing things and the fact is - based on evidence that was gathered in Swansea - that only 1% of visitors to Swansea accessed information through Tourist Information Centres,\"he said.\n\n\"We need to be looking into the future rather than the past and the future is digital.\"\nTL;DR: Wales is not reaching its full potential in attracting high-spending international tourists, a leading academic has said.\n\nArticle: The government says the plant, set to produce gasoline and petrochemicals including paraxylene, or PX, is essential to the local economy and will meet environmental standards.\n\nBut protesters fear it will end up polluting air and water.\n\nPhotos on weibo, China's version of Twitter, show people wearing masks and waving banners amid tight security. \n\nThe China National Petroleum Corporation plans to build the refinery in the nearby town of Anning. It would produce gasoline, diesel and fertilisers as well as PX.  \n\nBut not all are in favour of the plan, with some residents asking for the project's environmental review to be made public. \n\n\"The refinery is too close to Kunming,\"a protester was quoted by the South China Morning Post newspaper as saying.\"We don't want the refinery.\"\n\nReports said several hundred protesters were involved. An estimate by the Associated Press news agency put the number at about 2,000.\n\nOn 4 May, hundreds of people also protested against the plant, with some carrying posters warning against the dangers of a PX spill.\n\nA petition has also been posted on the White House website asking the US government to\"remonstrate with [the] Chinese government\"over the refinery. To date it has over 14,000 signatories. \n\nThe petitioners said they feared the plant would\"jeopardise human health\"because reliable\"scientific assessments\"had not been made, and PX was potentially carcinogenic. \n\nTwo years ago, protests against a PX factory in the city of Dalian forced the city government to close the plant, though it reportedly re-opened later.\n\nChina's rapid industrialisation has brought serious environmental concerns - but in recent years public protests have forced some projects to be reconsidered. \n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nSouth China Morning Post newspaper\nTL;DR: Protesters have taken to the streets of Kunming in China for the second time this month over plans for a refinery.\n\nArticle: By Natalia AntelavaBBC News\n\nThe soft, accented voice is easy to recognise.\"We need medical help urgently\u2026 We have this opportunity to send a USB stick out of the country, we will appreciate any help,\"Gulnara Karimova says. All the messages on the memory stick are in English, an acknowledgement that she doesn't expect help to come from within Uzbekistan.\n\nKarimova, 42, used to be the glamorous face of one of the most brutal, isolated and secretive regimes on earth, one often compared to North Korea. But that was before her dramatic and public falling out with her strongman father, President Islam Karimov.\n\nIn March, I received and authenticated a handwritten letter from Karimova, in which she said she and her daughter had been placed under house arrest. The letter was her last public communication until this month, when the short audio recordings were smuggled out of Uzbekistan. In them, Karimova says that their situation has deteriorated greatly. \n\n\"The territory of the house is basically surrounded now by hundreds of cameras and special equipment which is blocking any means of communication. So it's tremendous pressure and stress on me and my daughter. We need medical help urgently,\"Karimova says in one of the recordings.\n\nThroughout the recordings she repeats her concerns for her 16-year-old daughter Iman. According to Karimova's son Islam Karimov Jr, a student at Oxford Brookes University, Iman has always worn a monitoring device for a heart condition that she has suffered from since childhood. But the device, he says, has now been taken away and she has missed an annual round of treatment. Karimov Jr adds that his mother is also in need of surgery, and that since the recordings were smuggled out the pair may have even been denied access to food.\n\nUzbekistan has a history of human rights violations. Andrew Stroehlein from Human Rights Watch says that next month his organisation will publish a report on dozens of wrongfully imprisoned people in the country, whose cases are backed by\"multiple sets of corroborating evidence from reliable sources, gathered through months of painstaking research\". \n\nBut he says the problem with the\"Gulnara Case\"is that all of it comes from a single source - herself. \n\nStroehlein is cautious when it comes to Karimova's recent concern for human rights in Uzbekistan, since it follows a decade-long period when the woman known as\"Googoosha\"wielded immense power in the country.\"She almost certainly had top-level regime access to critical information regarding serious and systematic rights abuses in Uzbekistan, and she has had many opportunities to hand that information over to journalists and human rights groups,\"he says.\"She hasn't.\"\n\nUzbekistan's embassy in London did not comment on Karimova's allegations or situation. \n\nMore from the Magazine\n\nBefore her Twitter feed went quiet in February, Gulnara Karimova exchanged a number of tweets with Natalia Antelava.\n\nKarimova's messages, whether in Russian or broken English, were elusive and full of riddles, but still projected a shaft of light on the bizarre world of Uzbek politics.\n\nAntelava's feature, published in January 2014, charted\"Googoosha's\"very public fall from grace.\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Googoosha?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbekistan's president, used to be one of the most powerful people in Central Asia.

However there has been no official confirmation of his identity.\n\nMr Hatz was head of Research and Development at VW-owned Porsche and had held other roles in the VW group, including in engine development at Audi. He was suspended after the diesel emissions test-cheating was exposed.  He then left the company. \n\nLast year Porsche said no evidence had been found against him. \n\nMr Hatz was reportedly close to former VW chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, who has denied any knowledge of the\"defeat devices\"which allowed vehicles to artificially reduce emissions during tests before their existence was exposed publicly.\n\nAnother former Audi executive, Giovanni Pamio, was taken into custody earlier this year, at the request of the US Department of Justice. One man has so far been jailed in connection with the scandal: Volkswagen engineer James Liang received a 40 month sentence in a US court last month.\n\n'Unexpected and unwelcome'\n\nNews of the additional financial burden from dealing with vehicles in the United States underlines the difficulty the company is having extricating itself from the scandal.\n\nShares in the German carmaker initially fell sharply on Friday although they later recovered most of the lost ground.\n\n\"This is yet another unexpected and unwelcome announcement from VW, not only from an earnings and cash flow perspective but also with respect to the credibility of management,\"said Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nVW first admitted in September 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat US emissions tests. \n\nSince then the firm has been adapting its cars to meet legal requirements. But the process in the United States is proving tougher than expected.\n\nIt is also amending cars in Europe, but the process there is more straightforward, VW said.\n\nThe additional costs will be reflected in VW's third quarter results, which will be reported next month.\nTL;DR: The diesel emissions cheating scandal will cost Volkswagen an extra $3bn (\u20ac2.5bn), because engines are proving \"far more technically complex and time consuming\" to adapt the company  said.\n\nArticle: By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter\n\nSurfers are better known for getting excited about big waves.\n\nLast month, American Garrett McNamara rode what may have been the highest wave ever caught by a surfer.\n\nExperts have been asked to certify the new record - 100ft (30m) according to some reports - set at Nazare, Portugal.\n\nMcNamara holds the current world record after surfing a wave of 78ft (24m) in November 2011 at the same location.\n\nBut Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway is trying to draw attention to giant waves for a different reason.\n\nHebridean Marine Energy Futures, a project involving the college in partnership with universities and energy companies, has been recording wave heights off the west coast of Lewis for more than two years.\n\nIt says wave energy in the Western Isles has the potential to generate as much power as dozens of nuclear power stations.\n\nThe project uses devices called wave rider buoys, installed about five nautical miles off Bragar and Siader in Lewis, to gather data about wave height and strength.\n\nDuring winds gusting up to hurricane force on Monday, the buoys detected waves averaging 14m (45ft) in height and reaching a maximum of more than 23m (75.5ft).\n\nArne Vogler, a senior research engineer and principle investigator on the project, said:\"The sea is still building up and even higher waves are anticipated during the day.\"\n\nHe added:\"We are talking about vast amounts energy being deposited on our shore.\"\n\nNuclear power\n\nThe project team have calculated how much energy could be generated from the action of waves.\n\nThe average wave power measured off Lewis over a one year period, October 2011 to Sept 2012, was 75.5 kilowatts per metre.\n\nThe Saltire Prize, which was launched by the Scottish government and Crown Estate to accelerate the development marine renewables, estimated that 42.4kW/m could be generated from the same area.\n\n\"This indicates that the wave power resource off the Outer Hebrides is even better than what was thought to be the case,\"said Mr Vogler.\n\n\"Based on average wave power of 75kW/m and a 200km coastline from Butt of Lewis to Barra, the total mean power would be 15GW - equivalent to 12 modern nuclear power plants, such as Torness.\"  \n\nBut according to his calculations, during storms such as Monday's, the wave power potential down the 124 miles (200km) length of the Western Isles could match the output of 120 Torness-sized nuclear power stations.\n\nMr Vogler added that the challenge to renewables companies would be to come up with technology able to stand up to the most extreme conditions.\nTL;DR: Monster waves are being recorded off the west of Lewis in the Western Isles.

continuous dual carriageway between Aberdeen and Ellon.\n\nMr Brown predicted the multi-million pound work would lead to improved safety and faster journey times.\n\nThere is not yet a definite time scale for the scheme, which is estimated to cost more than \u00a350m.\n\nThe larger scale \u00a3400m Aberdeen bypass, aimed at creating a fast link to the north, west and south of Aberdeen, is currently the focus of a legal challenge.\n\nA Transport Scotland spokesperson said:\"Assuming a successful outcome to the appeal, the cost estimates for both this scheme and the A90 Balmedie to Tipperty scheme will be reviewed and updated prior to the commencement of the formal procurement process.\"\n\n'Economic benefit'\n\nNorth East SNP MSP Maureen Watt said of the A90 upgrade:\"Many people and businesses throughout the north east journey on that stretch of road on a daily basis and reducing the journey times they face will have a tangible economic benefit.\"\n\nScottish Lib Dem transport spokeswoman Alison McInnes said:\"The decision to upgrade the A90 is of course to be welcomed as it will ease congestion in the area and make this stretch of road so much safer.\"\n\nShe urged that the upgrade be built as soon as possible.\n\nKevin Stewart, chairman of North East of Scotland Transport Partnership (Nestrans) said:\"Naturally we welcome the news regarding the dualling of the A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty as this scheme has been of our main areas of priority for some time.\n\n\"It is obviously in the interests of the vast majority of those who use this extremely busy corridor that construction of the dual carriageway commences as soon as possible.\"\n\nAnd Bob Collier, chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said:\"The announcement that the transport minister has now confirmed the chosen route for the essential A90 upgrade between Balmedie and Tipperty is welcome news because it moves the project one step closer to becoming a reality.\n\n\"The dualling of this stretch of road is one of the priorities of the chamber's ongoing transport campaign as the improvements are crucial in order to tackle congestion, reduce journey times for commuters and improve safety for motorists.\"\nTL;DR: A scheme to make the busy A90 between Balmedie and Tipperty in Aberdeenshire a dual carriageway is to proceed, the Scottish government has announced.\n\nArticle: MPs voted by 319 to 308 to remove an amendment to the Trade Bill which would have forced ministers to withdraw from deals with nations the UK High Court ruled guilty of mass killings.\n\nIt comes amid condemnation of China's treatment of the Uighur people. \n\nThe rebels believe they have enough support to secure another vote soon.\n\nAmong those to defy the government were ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet ministers David Davis and Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. \n\nInternational courts\n\nThe rebellion is one of the largest on an issue not related to the Covid-19 pandemic during Boris Johnson's time as prime minister. \n\nThe government has a Commons majority of 80 but this was whittled down to just 11 as prominent ex-ministers such as Tobias Ellwood, Caroline Nokes and Nusrat Ghani, as well as a number of MPs first elected last year, sided with the opposition.\n\nMPs have been debating proposals, tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Alton, to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide, a decision currently left to the jurisdiction of international courts.  \n\nThe proposals, also backed by Labour, would mean that ministers would have to revoke post-Brexit trade deals with countries that were ruled to be carrying out systematic mass killings. \n\nThe issue is expected to resurface when the Trade Bill returns to the House of Lords.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Conservative rebels, led by former leader Iain Duncan Smith, were unable to force a vote on a separate amendment they had proposed.\n\nEvery speaker in today's debate - from the front and back benches - said genocide was abhorrent. The worst of crimes. There was united criticism of China's brutal treatment of the Uighurs too. \n\nBut the question Parliament has been wrestling with is whether the High Court should have the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. And if they did judge a country has been carrying out mass killings, should the High Court be able to compel the government to revoke any trade treaty it has with that country? \n\nMinisters insist it should be the job of elected governments, not judges, to determine trade policy. But opposition parties and a large cohort of Tory backbenchers argue it's essential the High Court can rule on genocide and ensure the UK's new trade-making freedom has an obligation to uphold human rights too. \n\nThis also is an argument about where power lies after Brexit and what role Parliament should have in shaping trade policy after decades in the EU.\n\nBut BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said that by securing large, but not overwhelming, support for Lord Alton's amendment in the Commons, the rebels hope the government will accept Mr Duncan Smith's own amendment - which would give the Commons the right to debate whether trade deals can be halted if genocide is proven. \n\nThe debate came as the US government formally declared that China was committing genocide in its repression of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang.\n\n'Light of hope'\n\nThe UK government has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and last week announced measures to cut UK business links with forced labour camps in the region. \n\nBut some MPs suspect the government is pulling its punches to avoid antagonising Beijing. \n\nMr Duncan Smith said the debate was\"all about simply shining a light of hope to all those out there who have failed to get their day in court and failed to be treated properly\".\n\n\"If this country doesn't stand up for that then I want to know what would it ever stand up for again?,\"he added. \n\nBut Trade Minister Greg Hands said it was unprecedented and unacceptable to give the courts powers to revoke trade deals agreed by elected governments. \n\nAnd he argued that no one would benefit from the proposal because the UK currently had no free trade deal with China.\nTL;DR: The government has narrowly seen off a rebellion by 33 Tory MPs, who want to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to be committing genocide.\n\nArticle: Dated 26 October 1962, the letter, signed by Denis Follows, then secretary of the Football Association, offers an annual salary of \u00a34,500.\n\nSir Alf, who died in 1999, managed England for 11 years, winning the World Cup in 1966.\n\nA silver salver commemorating his 100th game in charge of England topped the letter, selling for \u00a33,600.\n\nBoth were sold for several times their reserve price. \n\nThirty lots from the estate of Sir Alf's widow Lady Victoria Ramsey, who died in March, went under the hammer at Clarke and Simpson auction house in Framlingham, Suffolk.\n\nThe letter details a salary rising annually by \u00a3100 increments to a maximum of \u00a35,000, to start from the following May.\n\nThe salary would equate to about \u00a395,500 today.\n\nThe salver was presented to Sir Alf by the Council of the FA at England's match against Wales in 1972.\n\nThere had been an estimate of \u00a3600-800 on the letter, with the salver expected to attract between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500.\n\nItems from Sir Alf's time as manager at Ipswich Town, who he led to become English champions in the 1961-62 season, were also sold at the auction.\n\nGeoff Barfoot, from the auction house, had said it was\"exciting\"to be auctioning the items because of Ramsey's\"links to the local community\".\n\n\"A quirk of the letter is that the'O' in October is out of line, so perhaps the FA's typewriter wasn't very good!\"\n\nThe auction was held as England's 2018 World Cup players prepare for their opening match against Tunisia in Volgograd, Russia.\nTL;DR: A letter confirming World Cup-winning Sir Alf Ramsey's appointment as England manager has sold for \u00a33,400.\n\nArticle: Natalie Putt went missing from her home in Lower Gornal, Dudley, aged 17 in 2003, leaving behind her 11-week old son.\n\nShe was likely to have died at home or nearby on the day she disappeared, a coroner ruled in January.\n\nHer sister has travelled to Wales on what would have been Natalie's 33rd birthday to lay a stone in her memory.\n\nMs Putt's body has never been found and, recording an open verdict, coroner Zafar Siddique said it was unclear how she died.\n\nSister Rebecca Coggins appealed for anyone with information to speak up, saying:\"You were probably very, very young, it was a spur of the moment, whatever the circumstances, just put it right. \n\n\"Make it right for that baby, who is now a grown boy, for my children, her brothers, her sisters, her dad, put it right.\"\n\nMs Coggins has travelled to Machynlleth in Powys to lay a stone in her sister's memory on their mother's grave.\n\nShe said:\"The person quite literally could get away with murder, but not while I'm alive.

I didn't brush my hair that day,\"she said.\n\n\"They just asked for a photo of my face alongside what I really enjoy about working at the company.\"\n\nBut the resulting image of Ms Anchalee created a social media storm when it appeared on Bart, the San Francisco metro.\n\nLots of people questioned whether she really was an engineer.\n\n\"There were two other ads that went up that had two male co-workers - one of them was wearing a large black hat and a shirt that said'hacker',\"Ms Anchalee said.\n\n\"I thought that one might have been a little controversial but it was mine that people seemed to care about.\"\n\nStereotype\n\nFeeling\"helpless\", she wrote a blog post and launched the hashtag #ilooklikeanengineer - inviting other engineers to share their own portraits on Twitter, holding up a sign bearing the phrase.\n\n\"It was not just limited to women - it resonates with every single person who doesn't fit with what the stereotype should look like,\"she said.\n\nThousands of people have taken part, and other professions including surgeons and physicists have also adopted the idea.\n\nIsis Anchalee, who taught herself to code at the age of eight, is no stranger to her appearance and career choice causing confusion.\n\n\"You're way too hot to be an engineer,\"said a man in the lift of her block of flats when she wore a T-shirt from program-sharing service Github.\n\nAn awkward attempt at flattery, perhaps?\n\n\"It definitely was not a compliment,\"she countered.\n\n\"I was dumbfounded. What do you say to something like that?\n\n\"In a perfect world I would love for there not to be a need for me to stand out as a female engineer - but we have to work really hard.\n\n\"I've ended up where I'm at and I think I'm kicking ass.\"\n\n\"I chose my career against marriage\"- Sovita Dahal, software test engineer, Kathmandu\n\n\"My parents, my brother, my community, all were against me,\"said Sovita Dahal of her decision to pursue a career in technology.\n\n\"I was going against traditional things.\"\n\nNepalese women are still expected to marry at the age of about 21, go to live with their husbands and raise a family, she explained.\n\nBut Ms Dahal was determined to follow a different path.\n\n\"In my schooldays I was fascinated by electronic equipment like motors, transformers and LED lights. Later on this enthusiasm became my passion and ultimately my career,\"she said\n\nThere were just three women among the 35 students on her university course. One left, one got married and only Sovita Dahal finished her degree.\n\n\"After my high school [my family] didn't like me to enter the tech field - parents think it is only for boys, not for girls.\"\n\nFortunately she was able to win her family round.\n\n\"It was very, very, difficult to convince them.

There are a lot more women on site now.\"\n\nBut the argument that women have a biological struggle with maths and science subjects is infuriating, Ms Agrawal said.\n\n\"There is no proof that engineering isn't for women because of some biological reason.\n\n\"When people say,'Women are not naturally as good at maths and science,' nothing can make me more upset because it's simply not true.\"\n\nMs Agrawal would like to see more parents and teachers supporting the message that engineering is an achievable career for girls - but also believes that Britons in particular have an attitude problem to address as well.\n\n\"People easily say,'I'm terrible at maths,' or'I'm awful at numbers.' If you said that kind of thing in India people would look at you funny,\"she said.\n\n\"It's like saying,'Oh, I can't read,' and being proud of that fact.\"\n\n\"Women have blue-sky thinking\"- Dolphin Guan, industrial designer, Shenzhen\n\nFor Dolphin Guan, currently working with mobile phone company Seeed Studio in China, the difference between men and women is very much still an issue.\n\n\"Women have blue-sky thinking, men have precise thinking with logic,\"she said.\n\n\"So in our society, most of the females work on civilian [jobs], and men work in technology. But as technology is advancing, and everything becomes possible, it is very good that women [can] be part of it.\"\n\nMs Guan finished university last year. She studied computer science with 40 students, of whom just four or five were women - but in her industrial design class the gender ratio was 50:50.\n\n\"These years in China, I can see more and more women working in tech/engineering jobs,\"she said.\n\n\"And a good thing about being a tech/engineer is when we have a good idea, we are able to make it happen.\"\n\nClick here to listen to Business Daily's Ada Lovelace Day special from the BBC World Service\nTL;DR: On Ada Lovelace Day, four female engineers from around the world share their experiences of working in male-dominated professions.\n\nArticle: Douglas FraserBusiness/economy editor, Scotland\n\nAfter eight years of this, any loss of less than a billion ceases to have much impact. But for one quarter, from July to September, an attributable loss of \u00a3469m should still hurt.\n\nYet huge losses are priced in. The share price has fallen less than 1%. At less than 200p, it's below half the level of two years ago, and even further below breakeven point for its main shareholder, the UK government.\n\nBehind the latest figures are restructuring costs. They're going up. The restructure to spin off Williams & Glyn gets messier and more entangled. You'll recall, surely, that's the division RBS has been required to sell by the European Commission as a condition for being allowed all that government bail-out.\n\nIt is taking a further \u00a3500m from the full-year bottom line. And after all the effort to split it from the rest of RBS, there's a heavy hint that a buyer might want to take only part of it. That could be Clydesdale Bank, but RBS also hinted at others who might still be in the frame.\n\nWhoever it is, the sale isn't going to to be complete before the end of 2017, which is the deadline set by the European Commission.\n\nWill there be a penalty for that? Will the Commission concede that RBS has done enough to re-shape itself by other means, and that improved competition in the UK banking sector is a bit less of a priority (as the Treasury seems to think)?\n\nAnd how will this play with the (coincidental) Brexit negotiations? Could RBS use that to play the long game, and get out of the divestment? No, nobody knows the answers to any of these questions.\n\nThen there's litigation and conduct, adding nearly \u00a3500m more third-quarter losses. By conduct, of course, they mean misconduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\nSetting out the results, you could sense Ross McEwan, the chief executive, tense as he used the careful legal wording ahead of the report into RBS's treatment of client companies in financial distress: not all customers treated as they should have been, but no evidence of companies being collapsed\"artificially\".\n\nThere's also the legal action over the \u00a312bn rights issue in 2008, on which US litigants claim they were knowingly misled. An attempt to mediate a deal came to nothing in July. So that could still go to court next March, with a potential big pay-out to include in next year's accounts.\n\n\"Substantial additional charges and costs may be recognised in the coming quarters which would have an impact on the group's level of capital,\"warns the Royal.\n\nCompanies in trouble like to use the word\"historic\"about their\"legacy\"issues. So it is with RBS. But an interesting angle on its third-quarter results is that there is some noise that's more current.\n\nCapital Resolution was due to carry a \u00a31.5bn bill this year. That's now looking more like \u00a32bn. RBS has had to account for impairments to its loan book from exposure to shipping companies, as well as the oil and gas sector, and mining. Those choppy waters, well beyond British shores, are having a new impact.\n\nRoss McEwan warned at the start of 2016 that this year's accounts were going to be\"noisy\".  He wasn't kidding. These figures need earplugs.\nTL;DR: It's a familiar tale from RBS: everything's shipshape and cruising along nicely through choppy economic waters, except for the very nasty smell emanating from the bilges and that slight listing to starboard.\n\nArticle: King Bhumibol Adulyadej has had a lengthy spell in hospital in Bangkok and has not been seen in public for months.\n\nThe king is widely revered and seen as an arbiter in the country's divided political arena.\n\nThailand is preparing to celebrate 70 years of his reign on Thursday.\n\nThe monarch was treated for narrowing of the arteries with\"satisfactory results\", the palace said in a statement.\n\nDoctors performed a procedure known as balloon surgery to widen the arteries on Tuesday after tests had shown insufficient blood in the heart muscles, the statement said.\n\nIn the past month, the king has also been treated for a build up of fluid surrounding the brain and a swollen lung.\n\nAn X-ray on Saturday showed less fluid around the brain, the statement said.\n\nThe monarch's health is closely watched in Thailand as he is seen as a unifying symbol and pillar of stability in a society that has suffered increased political divisions and violence.\nTL;DR: Thailand's 88-year-old king, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has undergone heart surgery, the Thai Royal Household Bureau said.\n\nArticle: By David ShukmanScience editor\n\nThe measures cover plastic straws, plastic drinks stirrers and plastic cotton buds in England from April 2020. \n\nOnly plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale -

When any malware is discovered, it is shared around many experts for analysis - any attacker could simply reversion the code for their own use, like a cover version of a song.\n\nBut there's another, better clue: IP addresses - locations, essentially - known to be part of\"North Korean infrastructure\"formed part of the malware too. \n\nThis suggests the attack may have been controlled by people who have acted for North Korea in the past.\n\nWhat is the FBI evidence?\n\nSony Pictures chief executive and chairman Michael Lynton later told CNN it had not made an error in pulling the film.\n\nHe said the president, press and public were mistaken about the withdrawal, saying the decision had only been taken after major chains had refused to screen it.\n\nHe said:\"We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down.\"\n\nA Sony statement on Friday said that the firm was\"actively surveying alternatives to enable us to release the movie on a different platform\".\n\n\"It is still our hope that anyone who wants to see this movie will get the opportunity to do so,\"the statement said.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation officially tied North Korea to the cyber-attack, linking the country to malware used in the incident.\n\nHackers had earlier issued a warning referring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, saying\"the world will be full of fear\"if the film was screened.\n\nThe movie features James Franco and Seth Rogen as two journalists who are granted an audience with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe CIA then enlists the pair to assassinate him. The film was due to have been released over Christmas.\n\nThe film's cancelled release drew criticism in Hollywood, with some calling it an attack on the freedom of expression.\n\nActor George Clooney told the trade website Deadline on Thursday the film should be released online, saying Hollywood shouldn't be threatened by North Korea.\n\nIn November, a cyber-attack crippled computers at Sony and led to upcoming films and workers' personal data being leaked online.\n\nThe hackers also released salary details and social security numbers for thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities. \n\nNorth Korea earlier this month denied involvement in the hack - but praised the attack itself as a\"righteous deed\".\n\nAn article on North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency, quoting the country's top military body, said suggestions that Pyongyang was behind the attack were\"wild rumour\".\n\nHowever, it warned the US that\"there are a great number of supporters and sympathisers\"of North Korea\"all over the world\"who may have carried out the attack.\n\nIn the article, Sony Pictures was accused of\"abetting a terrorist act\"and\"hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership\"of North Korea by producing the movie.\nTL;DR: President Barack Obama has vowed a US response after North Korea's alleged cyber-attack on Sony Pictures.\n\nArticle: Mr Rees-Mogg was guest of honour at the Traditional Britain Group's annual dinner in May.\n\nThe group's Facebook page calls for Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, and\"millions of others\"to be\"requested to return to their natural homelands\".\n\nTBG denies being a far-right group. \n\nIt says it supports leaving the European Union and halting immigration but should not be\"smeared\".\n\nPosts by the group on its Facebook page criticised the decision, announced last week, to make Mrs Lawrence, whose son was murdered in a racially motivated attack in 1993, a Labour peer.\n\n'Smear'\n\nIt is also critical of the Conservative Party - saying its current leadership is\"liberal left\"- and\"likes\"the Facebook page of far-right French politician Marine Le Pen. It praised a by-election victory by her National Front party in May as\"excellent\".\n\nMr Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, addressed the group at their function in London in May.  \n\nIn a statement, he said he had been warned the day before about the group's\"right-wing connections\"and had questioned the organiser about them, who had told him\"it was a smear\".  \n\n\"I am shocked by the comments made by members of the Traditional Britain Group which I note from the Liberal Conspiracy website seem to have been made after I had addressed the dinner,\"Mr Rees-Mogg said.\n\n\"I can entirely disassociate myself with the Traditional Britain Group as I have never been a member or supporter.\"\n\nHe later told BBC's Newsnight:\"I clearly made a mistake.

But we believe that exiting the EU and halting immigration are crucial to the survival of the British nation. \n\n\"One appreciates this upsets the liberal-left but we should be permitted to entertain our own opinions on these matters just as they are, without being smeared as'far-right'. It is clear that people across the political spectrums amongst the man-in-the-street are concerned about immigration.\"\n\nHe added that the group was\"a traditional conservative organisation concerned about the future of Britain and our nation\"which encouraged discussion on its Facebook page by\"sometimes provocative links to stories\".\n\nIt later emerged that Mr Lauder-Frost is also a member of UKIP. \n\nA UKIP spokesman said:\"Mr Lauder Frost is an ordinary member, he holds no position or authority in the party.

It would be foolish to think that the UK could navigate these problems\"unscathed\". \n\nThis echoes comments by Chancellor George Osborne on Monday, who said:\"The British recovery has been damaged over the last two years by uncertainty in the euro and that uncertainty would be magnified were a country to leave. \n\n\"It is that uncertainty and not austerity that is doing real damage to the European recovery and indeed the British recovery.\"\n\n'UK recession'\n\nBut Labour said EU growth figures for the first quarter of the year - when it narrowly avoided going into the recession - showed the UK's recession was\"made in Downing Street\".\n\nIn the Commons, Labour leader Ed Miliband asked Mr Cameron what discussions he had had with new French President Francois Hollande on a growth plan for the continent.\n\nHe said it was\"a shame\"the prime minister had not meet Mr Hollande when he visited the UK a few months ago - when as the Socialist candidate for the presidency he met the Labour leader. \n\nMr Miliband added:\"Europe needs a proper growth plan which this prime minister has failed to argue for.

Falling oil prices also resulted in cheaper petrol prices.\n\nEconomists warn inflation could slide to 0.5% in 2020 as the economy shrinks. \n\nThe ONS's latest data was collected on 17 March, just before lockdown started on 23 March. But its head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said there were already signs people were spending less in shops and more on necessities such as food. \n\nThe agency said the average price of clothes and shoes fell 1.2% in the year to March 2020.\n\nIt also said average petrol prices stood at 119.4 pence per litre during the month - the lowest seen since February 2019, while diesel stood at 123.8p\n\nThe UK benchmark for oil has fallen to about $16 (\u00a313) a barrel as economic activity has slowed. That is a fall of about 75% since the start of the year. \n\nSarah Hewin, senior economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC's Today programme:\"Normally low inflation would be welcomed as it means people have effectively more to spend in the shop but these are not normal circumstances. \n\n\"The fall in inflation, in addition to low energy prices, is an indication of the steep recession we will see in the coming months.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics said:\"We suspect a larger fall in CPI inflation, from 1.5% to 0.9%, is in store for April as Ofgem [the regulator] lowers the cap on utility bills to reflect past falls in wholesale energy prices.\"\n\nHe added that falling employment, consumer caution and lower energy prices could pull inflation\"down to just 0.5% in the second half of this year\". \n\n'More help needed'\n\nCPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation.\n\nInflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the\"base rate\".

A grinding lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus had shut down life and business in the capital.\n\n\"I begged and begged them to retain me even without a salary. My boss said he had run out of business and money. He knew my situation, and said he was helpless,\"Ms Madan, who has more than a decade of work experience in office administration, told me.\n\nShe joined millions of Indians whose jobs have disappeared because of the pandemic. A month after the lockdown, 121 million Indians were out of work, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank.  \n\nSince then, the Indian economy has clawed back tens of millions of jobs, mainly in the informal and rural economies. (The bulk of India's 400-odd million jobs are in the informal economy.) \n\nThe CMIE, which conducts one of the world's largest continuous surveys to track household incomes, expenses and assets, reckons that 70 million such jobs lost at the peak of the lockdown in April have returned. \n\nThis is mainly because of the resumption of some economic activity and a bumper harvest that has not only helped absorb a large workforce but also created extra jobs on farms. The nationwide rural jobs guarantee programme has also helped.\n\nThat's where the good news appears to end. \n\nSome 19 million salaried, formal economy jobs have been lost after the lockdown, estimates the CMIE. A separate report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that more than 4 million Indians below the age of 30 have lost their jobs due to the pandemic. Those aged 15-24 are the hardest hit.\n\n\"The hit is largely among young people who are below 30 years. Companies are retaining experienced people and the axe is falling on younger people,\"Mahesh Vyas, managing director of the CMIE, told me.\n\nThis, many believe, could be the most worrying aspect of the joblessness blighting India's slowing economy, which is likely to contract sharply this year. \n\n\"Trainees and probationers have lost their jobs. Companies are not hiring on campuses. There's a hiring freeze. When the next batch of job seekers graduate in 2021, they will join the army of unemployed,\"says Mr Vyas. \n\nPostponement of jobs for fresh graduates means depressed wages, erosion of return on education, and lower savings in the long run.\"It impacts the job seeker, their families, the economy, everything,\"Mr Vyas adds.\n\nHousehold incomes are also shrinking because of widespread salary cuts and sluggish demand, forcing firms to cut corners. CMIE surveys in previous years would usually find some 35% of respondents saying their incomes were better than the previous year. This year only 2% of the respondents feel that way. \n\nThe decline in wages cuts across all groups - from the poor to the upper middle class. Salaried Indians have already withdrawn $4bn (\u00a33bn) from a mandatory contribution fund in four months after the lockdown, presumably to meet expenses after job losses and salary cuts, according to a report.\"The shrinkage of incomes is particularly striking in the middle and upper middle class,\"says Mr Vyas.\n\nAlso, more people are dropping out of the workforce because there are no jobs available. This is not a new development: a 2017 study by economist Vinoj Abraham, using jobs data collected by the labour bureau, found an absolute decline in employment - a drying up of existing jobs - between 2013-14 and 2015-16, possibly for the first time in independent India.\n\nLabour participation in the workforce - a measure of an economy's active workforce -  has fallen to around 35% from around 46% before the controversial 2016  currency ban that crippled India's economy, according to CMIE estimates. The current unemployment rate of 8% hides this shrinkage.\"This happens when it's futile to look for a job because none is available,\"Mr Vyas says.\n\nMs Madan would agree. She sent out her resume to two dozen firms without success even as she dipped into her savings and her mother's pension.\"I have stopped looking for jobs now,\"she told me. \n\nIncome insecurity is acute in India. A study by researchers Marianne Bertrand, Kaushik Krishnan and Heather Schofield on how Indians were coping during the lockdown found that only 66% of the households had the resources to go on for more than another week before facing economic distress. \n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government is not in denial over job losses. Even new employment in government fell by 60% in June compared to the monthly average in the last financial year.  \n\nLast week, Ms Sitharaman told a meeting that India was\"facing an extraordinary situation\u2026 an act of God where we may even see a contraction\". The Covid-19 caseload is inching towards 3.5 million, and much of the economy remains stalled. A full economic recovery seems to be distant. \n\nThe informal economy is slowly picking up, as many workers who returned to their villages after losing jobs after the lockdown are slowly trickling back to cities as their workplaces open up. Some are even getting paid more by their employers desperate to reopen their businesses.\n\n\"By the end of the year, more jobs will return as the economy continues to open,\"says KR Shyam Sundar, a labour economist.\"But salaried employment will take time to pick up. This is going to be a long haul.\"\nTL;DR: In early May, Shalika Madan, who worked in a law firm in the Indian capital, Delhi, received a call from her office and was told that she was being laid off.\n\nArticle: The course of the 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given has been corrected by 80%, according to the Suez Canal Authority.\n\nIt added that further efforts to move the boat would resume later on Monday.\n\nBut the head of a company involved in the rescue efforts urged caution, warning that completing the operation would not be\"a piece of cake\".\n\nThe Ever Given has been blocking one of the world's busiest trade routes, forcing companies to reroute ships and causing long tailbacks of hundreds of vessels.\n\nThe reports that the ship had been partially freed raised hopes that traffic along the canal could resume within hours, clearing the way for an estimated $9.6bn (\u00a37bn) of goods being held up each day.\n\nRescue workers from the authority and the Dutch company Smit Salvage used tug boats to wrench the rear of the ship from the canal bank.\n\nAlongside the tugs, dredgers have been digging out sand and mud from under the bow of the vessel. \n\nThe stern, which had been 4m from the shore, was now 102m clear, the Suez Canal Authority said, adding that the boat had been fully refloated.\n\nEfforts to move the boat resumed at 11:30 local time (09:30 GMT) when the tide was due to rise.\n\nIn a statement, the Suez Canal Authority said that once the tide had reached 2m, rescue workers would aim to fully restore\"the vessel's direction so it is positioned in the middle of the navigable waterway\".\n\nTraffic would resume once the ship was moved to a waiting area in a wider section of the canal, the authority said. A total of 367 vessels are waiting to pass through, and officials have said it will take three and a half days to clear the traffic jam.\n\n\"We will not waste one second,\"Suez Canal Authority Chairman Osama Rabie told Egyptian state television.\n\nThe CEO of the salvage company involved in the rescue efforts told Dutch public radio that the operation was far from complete.\n\n\"We have movement, which is good news. But I wouldn't say it's a piece of cake now,\"Peter Berdowski said. \n\nHe explained that high-pressure water would be used to try and remove sand and clay from underneath the bow of the ship, but if that failed, then containers would have to be lifted in an operation that could take some time.\n\n\"The bow is still stuck rock-solid at the moment in the slightly sandy clay,\"he said.\n\nThe 200,000-tonne Ever Given ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies were brought in to help refloat the ship.\n\nOn Sunday, canal officials began preparing to remove some of roughly 18,000 containers on board in order to lighten the load. The containers are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\nLast week, one freight operator in the UK told the BBC they were waiting for 20 boxes containing\"coconut milk and syrups, some spare parts for motors... some fork lift trucks [and] some Amazon goods\".\n\nThe canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world with about 12% of total global trade moving through it. It provides the shortest link between Asia and Europe.\n\nAn alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer.\n\nAccording to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn of goods each day - or $400m an hour.\nTL;DR: The stern of a huge container ship that has been wedged across the Suez Canal for almost a week has been freed from the shoreline, officials say.\n\nArticle: Ben Ryan created the artificial limb after his 10-day-old son Sol's arm was amputated because of a blood clot. \n\nHe set up Ambionics and recently moved into the new M-Sparc science park near his home on Anglesey, but has said he cannot get the funding he needs.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was still talking to Mr Ryan about funding.\n\nMr Ryan recently made the shortlist for a UK Inventors prize, having initially developed the bionic arm with help from Pontio Innovation centre at Bangor University and later Warwick University.\n\nHe said he had been unable to get funding to develop the business because he does not fall within the criteria for different pots of money from the Welsh Government or the Development Bank of Wales. \n\nHe also said he was told on a technicality he could not use the \u00a343,000 raised through crowd-funding and donations to get match funding from the development bank.\n\nHe said:\"I've taken a \u00a330,000 pay cut to focus on this.

It said the wider economic impact could be as high as $5bn. \n\nThe San Diego convention centre estimates the annual July event generates some $140m in economic impact for the region. \n\nExperts say the growth has been fuelled in part by a Hollywood that has mined comic books and science fiction for blockbusters, broadening the fan base.\n\nAdvances in special effects since 2000, when X-Men was released, have increased the success of movie adaptations, says Mr Miller. (Warner Bros. and Disney own the two major comic publishing outfits.) \n\nThe popularity of the events also coincides with a rise in spending on live entertainment, particularly among younger customers.\n\nSome of the shift reflects a wealthier society with money to burn beyond basic needs, says Stephanie Tully, a marketing professor at University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, who has researched consumer spending.\n\nBut she says there's an additional factor at play: Fear Of Missing Out - a phenomenon popularly dubbed FOMO - which has been exacerbated by social media.\n\n\"It's really difficult to substitute this year's comic con with next year's comic con,\"says Eesha Sharma, a professor at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business who worked with Ms Tully on a new study that shows people are more likely to go into debt to pay for experiences than material goods. \n\nCompanies have taken note of the phenomenon. \n\nDisney is investing heavily in its theme parks and big investors such as TPG Capital, a private equity giant, have plunged money into troupes such as Cirque du Soleil.\n\n\"What I hear and what I see is that companies... have a huge interest in live entertainment at the moment,\"says John Maatta, a former television executive who is now chief at Wizard World, which ran comic conventions in more than a dozen US cities last year. \n\nMr Maatta says he thinks people put more value on real-world interaction as more of our lives play out online. \n\n\"There's no substitute for human connection,\"he says.\n\nBattle of the Cons\n\nThe growing circus at the San Diego festival, which unlike many others is run by a not-for-profit operation, has turned off some industry stalwarts. \n\nEarlier this month, Mile High Comics, a major comics retailer, said it would not attend for the first time in more than 40 years. Other long time participants have started their own events.\n\nDavid Glanzer, a spokesman for Comic-Con International: San Diego, did not respond to questions about its approach.\n\nThe group in 2014 filed a lawsuit against a smaller Salt Lake City event, alleging that the group had violated its trademark.  \n\nBut for the most part, organizers have appeared content to let the fandom multiply. \n\nReedPOP, part of a London-based company, started the New York Comic Con in 2006 - it's expected to draw some 200,000 people this year - and now runs about 30 events globally in cities that include Shanghai, Mumbai and Sydney. \n\nEvent director Mike Armstrong says there's some room to grow in the US, and even more opportunity overseas.\n\n\"I'm very much of the mindset that rising waters will lift all ships,\"says Mr Armstrong.\"I view smaller shows as feeder opportunities to get people excited and interested so they might one day want to attend New York Comic Con.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Wizard World, which has scaled back the number of shows since 2015, warned investors it may not be able to continue in business. But Mr Maatta said the problem was temporary and didn't reflect the bigger market.\n\nThe firm has righted itself with new financing and announcements of additional conventions are coming, he says.\n\n\"The plan is just to intensify what we're doing,\"he says.\n\nHazy outlook\n\nAre there clouds on the horizon? \n\nRobert Salkowitz, the author of Comic-Con and the Business of Pop Culture, has followed the comic industry's rise since the 1990s. \n\n\"I always have my eye on how it could fall apart,\"he says.\n\nSales at comic book shops were flat in 2016 and have slipped this year, according to Comichron.\n\nBut Mr Marshall said that compares to banner performance in prior years. Comic sales at general audience book stores continue to grow and movies, such as Wonder Woman, still rake in millions at the box office.\n\nA few flops might scare off the industry, but for now Mr Salkowitz says he thinks the market is healthy.\n\n\"Fandom has grown big enough,\"he says.\n\nMr Maatta agrees:\"I don't think it's a fad,\"he says.\"I'd almost say it's a lifestyle.\"\nTL;DR: San Diego's Comic-Con International, happening this weekend, is an annual fiesta of costumes, comic books and celebrities that sits at the centre of a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nArticle: By Paul MellyWest Africa analyst\n\nSo what's new? Is this just a case of Paris once again acting as gendarme in a former sub-Saharan colony?\n\nAre we back to the days when the famously influential Jacques Foccart acted as Africa adviser in the Elysee Palace and French paratroops made and unmade governments, protecting allies - some of them deeply unsavoury - and displacing supposed troublemakers?\n\nIt's tempting to drag out all the old cliches. After all, the CAR is the remote backwater briefly transformed into a titular\"empire\"in the 1970s by the bizarre Jean-Bedel Bokassa, who allegedly studded his friendships in the French elite with diamonds.\n\nWhen Bokassa's credibility was finally shattered by allegations of cannibalism - although this was never proven - French troops intervened. Operation Barracuda saw Bokassa overthrown and former President David Dacko installed in his place.\n\nBut the temptation to reach for old history should be resisted. We are not in the 1970s. Africa has changed. And so has France.\n\nOpt to act\n\nParis has started to send extra troops to reinforce an under-powered regional intervention force led by the African Union (AU).\n\nThe peacekeepers are struggling to restore order in a huge country where warlords and criminal gangs, many of them foreign, have run amok. \n\nThe unrest is now sparking a dangerous new spiral of inter-communal religious conflict between local Christian and Muslim communities. Some 460,000 people have been driven from their homes and more than a million are dependent on external aid.\n\nIt is this catastrophic humanitarian and security crisis that France is now seeking to help contain with the despatch of the heavily equipped troops and high tech support that only a major military power can provide.\n\nParis has been trying to stir international engagement since September, when President Francois Hollande put the CAR at the centre of his address to the United Nations. It has drafted a Security Council resolution that this week should give UN backing for a beefed up AU or UN force.\n\nBut such operations need time to organise, and finance. And in the meantime, an emergency is worsening by the day. So after talks with Central African Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, the French have opted to act anyway.\n\nThis humanitarian security intervention, acting to complement an international or African Union effort, is a far cry from the self-interested military meddling of the immediate post-colonial era.\n\nFundamental reform\n\nTo outside eyes this may seem a new and sudden change. But in fact the nature of French military engagement in Africa has been evolving from the old paternalism for almost 20 years.\n\nA key turning point was the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. French troops supposedly sent to protect refugees ended up creating the space for many genocidal killers to escape across the border to Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThis episode provoked painful reflection among French policymakers, particularly Alain Juppe, who was foreign minister at the time. Becoming prime minister shortly afterwards, he launched a fundamental reform of France's Africa policy which was continued by his Socialist successor Lionel Jospin.\n\nAnd after Nicolas Sarkozy became president in 2007, the process was taken a step further, with a review of France's permanent military deployments and a rewrite of longstanding bilateral defence accords with African allies, abandoning the commitment to use military force in defence of incumbent friendly regimes.\n\nConsensus\n\nDuring these almost two decades of reform, France has continued occasionally to intervene, but increasingly it has done so in a neutral peacekeeping role. \n\nIt made a vain effort to hold the ring between government troops and mutineers in the CAR in the late 1990s.\n\nBut wherever possible France has sought to operate as part of a UN or European Union force, rather than acting on its own. In 2003, France led Operation Artemis to tackle militias who were killing civilians in north-eastern DR Congo. It was the first autonomous EU military intervention outside Europe.\n\nIn Ivory Coast in the 2000s, France's Licorne force worked alongside UN troops to maintain the line of partition between the government-controlled south and the rebel-held north.\n\nIn the CAR, French troops and regional peacekeepers collaborated in fighting to prevent a rebel takeover of communities in the north. And Mr Sarkozy subsequently persuaded EU partners to join France in deploying the Eufor force to secure the Central African and Chadian frontiers with Sudan's troubled Darfur region in 2008-09.\n\nBut not all the interventions of the Sarkozy era commanded consensus.\n\nIn Ivory Coast in early 2011, operating under the authority of the UN Secretary General, French troops helped former rebels loyal to election winner Alassane Ouattara capture Laurent Gbagbo, the defeated incumbent, who had opted to fight rather than accept the outcome of the November 2010 presidential contest.\n\nThis intervention to support the enforcement of Mr Ouattara's election victory was in line with the stance taken by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) bloc, to which Ivory Coast belongs. But it discomfited Mr Gbagbo's allies such as South Africa and Angola.\n\nMore contentious still was the 2011 French and British intervention in Libya, to support rebels fighting Muammar Gaddafi. This angered many sub-Saharan leaders because the AU was trying to achieve a negotiated solution.\n\nPartnership of respect\n\nMr Hollande came to power in France in May 2012, just weeks after jihadist groups had taken over northern Mali. Yet in handling this new crisis he made a point of breaking sharply with Mr Sarkozy's unilateralist tendencies.\n\nMr Hollande has argued that the relationship between France and Africa must be a partnership of respect, even when there are disagreements. And he has gone out of his way to consult African leaders before launching military action.\n\nWhen jihadists launched a fresh offensive in January 2013, threatening to break through into the south of Mali, France knew that it alone had the military capability to stop them. \n\nThe African deployment planned for later in the year could not be brought forward in time.\n\nAlthough the US has regularly trained West African armies for combat against jihadists, France was uniquely well-placed to stage a direct military intervention in Mali, because of its long experience of operations in Africa and its existing military presence.\n\nOnce Mr Hollande took the decision to intervene, his commanders were able to despatch special forces combat helicopters from Burkina Faso, to stage initial strikes against the jihadists. France also mobilised warplanes based in Chad, special forces based in Senegal and armoured units from its operations in Ivory Coast.\n\nBut even as final military preparations were being made, Mr Hollande and his ministers made a point of calling leaders across Africa to seek their views.\n\nThe warm sub-Saharan welcome for the Malian intervention has helped to create a climate in which France can more easily intervene in the CAR. And that subject will surely have been on the menu of Mr Hollande's talks with President Jacob Zuma during a recent visit to South Africa.\n\nThis time, as in Mali, the African political ground for a French deployment has been carefully prepared.\n\nAnd later this week Paris is hosting leaders from across the continent at a summit on African peace and security.\nTL;DR: A fresh crisis in Africa - and once again French troops are on their way. This time around 1,000 extra soldiers are heading to the Central African Republic (CAR) to restore order after a rebel takeover. They will supplement the 400 odd French troops already on the ground in the country.\n\nArticle: Curtis Allen, 49, Gavin Wright, 49, and Patrick Eugene Stein, 47, had gathered firearms and explosives for the attack, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nThe members of a militia group called the Crusaders also kept watch on the target in Garden City, officials said.\n\nThey allegedly planned to strike on 9 November, a day after the US elections.\n\nThe suspects had prepared a manifesto and conspired to detonate a bomb at apartments where Somalis were among some 120 residents, said prosecutors.\n\nThey allegedly discussed parking four explosives-packed vehicles at the corners of the complex to create a large blast in the meatpacking town.\n\nMr Stein offered to provide ammonium nitrate for the devices and contribute up to $300 (\u00a3246) for other materials, according to prosecutors.\n\nIf convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nActing US Attorney Tom Beall said the eight-month investigation had taken FBI agents\"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence\".  \n\nA confidential source attended meetings of the militia group to collect information, according to documents.\n\nIn one of those gatherings, papers said, there was a proposal to carry out an attack similar to the Orlando nightclub shooting.\n\nMr Beall said they ultimately decided to attack the building because of the number of Somalis who lived there.\n\nFriday's charges prompted the Council on American-Islamic Relations to urge law enforcement to boost protection for US mosques. \n\n\"We ask our nation's political leaders, and particularly political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our nation,\"Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, said in a statement.\nTL;DR:", "test_query": "Curtis Allen, 49, Gavin Wright, 49, and Patrick Eugene Stein, 47, had gathered firearms and explosives for the attack, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nThe members of a militia group called the Crusaders also kept watch on the target in Garden City, officials said.\n\nThey allegedly planned to strike on 9 November, a day after the US elections.\n\nThe suspects had prepared a manifesto and conspired to detonate a bomb at apartments where Somalis were among some 120 residents, said prosecutors.\n\nThey allegedly discussed parking four explosives-packed vehicles at the corners of the complex to create a large blast in the meatpacking town.\n\nMr Stein offered to provide ammonium nitrate for the devices and contribute up to $300 (\u00a3246) for other materials, according to prosecutors.\n\nIf convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nActing US Attorney Tom Beall said the eight-month investigation had taken FBI agents\"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence\".  \n\nA confidential source attended meetings of the militia group to collect information, according to documents.\n\nIn one of those gatherings, papers said, there was a proposal to carry out an attack similar to the Orlando nightclub shooting.\n\nMr Beall said they ultimately decided to attack the building because of the number of Somalis who lived there.\n\nFriday's charges prompted the Council on American-Islamic Relations to urge law enforcement to boost protection for US mosques. \n\n\"We ask our nation's political leaders, and particularly political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our nation,\"Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, said in a statement.", "prediction": "Three men have been charged in the US with planning a bombing attack on a housing complex in Kansas where Somali residents live.\n\nArticle: The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has seen a rise in patients with a condition known as \"tinnitus\" -

If we weren't banging on the dining table trying to make a beat, we were walking around with a recorder, recording tunes.\"\n\nDeciding early on that he didn't want to follow family tradition by becoming a composer, Malik opted instead to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter.\n\n\"I don't think I was cut out to do composing,\"he admits.\"That's not my thing. I became the first singer in the family instead.\"\n\nMalik began performing at the age of eight, and was given his first taste of fame a year later when he appeared as a contestant on the Indian talent show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L'il Champs. Similar to shows such as American Idol and The Voice, Malik finished in eighth place - and realised he still had a lot of work to do.\n\n\"I learned that I needed to be a better singer, for sure,\"he says.\n\nHe also acknowledges his lack of confidence on stage at that time.\"When you're singing in front of a studio audience it's a different ball game altogether,\"he explains.\"I was only nine and I hadn't experienced that before.\n\n\"But after that show I was a much more confident performer. I became very open and could face people in an audience, and that whole stage fright thing went away.\"\n\n'Breakthrough'\n\nAt 18, Malik made his debut as a playback singer - recording songs which are later mimed by actors in films. The song Tumko Toh Aana Hi Tha, which featured in the Hindi-language film Jai Ho, was composed by his brother Amaal and performed by Armaan. It propelled him into the limelight. \n\n\"That was my breakthrough,\"Malik says.\"That's when my journey began and my career as a professional singer started.\"\n\nHe has since performed in more than 200 shows around the world and is the youngest singer of Indian origin to have performed at London's Wembley Arena. \n\nAnd remarkably, he can perform songs in almost a dozen different languages - even though he actually only speaks two: Hindi and English.\n\nSo how does someone who only speaks two languages manage to sing in more than 10?\n\n\"I don't know,\"he says.\n\n\"It started when I was a jingle singer around the age of nine. A producer asked me if I could try doing the same thing I just did, but in another language. They played it to me and because my ears are very sharp I heard how they were pronouncing it - and then I just reproduced it.\"\n\nSome of Malik's biggest releases include the Hindi songs Bol Do Na Zara, live show favourite Main Hoon Hero Tera and the Telugu song Butta Bomma, which currently has 465 million views on YouTube.\n\nFirmly entrenched in Bollywood culture, Malik nonetheless regards English music as his true passion. \n\nGrowing up, he listened to the likes of Bruno Mars, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Frank Sinatra, Chris Brown and many other English-speaking artists. But he cites US singer-songwriter John Mayer as key to shaping his artistry.\n\n\"I think he's the complete artist,\"Malik says.\"I saw a video of him performing his song Neon, where he had no band, no supporting musicians - it was just him, on a guitar, and that's it. He killed it.\n\n\"It made me say,'Wow, I want to be an artist that is so complete in himself and there's nothing else required to produce music and just put it out.'\"\n\nUK artist Jay Sean, a pioneer of Bhangra-R&B fusion, is another figure who has made a huge impact on Malik.\n\n\"I've followed his career since he was in the Rishi Rich Project,\"he says.\"Being one of the first Indian origin artists to break into the Western mainstream music scene was very inspiring for so many people.\"\n\nIn 2011, Malik received a scholarship to attend the summer programme at Berklee College of Music in Boston, which he completed with honours. It marked a turning point.\n\n\"When I got back from Berklee, I told my dad I really wanted to pursue English music and put out a pop record,\"he says. \n\nInitially his father was against the idea, telling Malik there was not a big market for English music in India.\n\n\"He told me to concentrate on Indian music and Bollywood for a few years - create a fan base here, become a big artist in India and then use it to leverage a career in English music.\"\n\nTaking his father's advice, Malik developed that loyal fan base (they call themselves the Armaanians) and has now transitioned into the world of global pop music. \n\nSigned to Arista Records, he released his first three English-language songs this year, including the recent infectious\"earworm\"How Many, which begs the question - how many chances should you give a failing relationship?\n\nIn addition to his music, Malik has also had success as a voice actor. \n\nIn 2019, he voiced Aladdin in the Hindi-dubbed version of Disney's live-action remake. In the same year, he provided the singing voice of Simba in the Hindi version of The Lion King.\n\nHe also lent his voice to BBC Radio 1's adaptation of Slumdog Millionaire, as Salim.\n\nLooking ahead, Malik is eyeing up some high-profile collaborations with the likes of Charlie Puth, Anne-Marie and DJ Zedd. \n\nHe wants fans to see his versatility - and the full scope of his musicality. \n\n\"I've always yearned to be an artist who puts out his own music, where the artist himself is contributing to the lyrics, to the sound and to the production,\"he says.\n\n\"So with my English pop music and the music that's going to follow in 2021, that's my main aim. I want my music to be an extension of me and I want the fans to see that side of me.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Regions with less than 15% intensive care capacity - including Southern California and the Sacramento area - will be on lockdown for at least three weeks. \n\nIn the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an emergency order for residents to stay home with immediate affect, following an unprecedented surge of infections.\"It's time to cancel everything. If it isn't essential, don't do it,\"Mr Garcetti said. \n\nA similar order is already in place in Los Angeles county - the current epicentre of America's outbreak - where some hospitals are already approaching full capacity. Authorities reported 5,987 cases on Tuesday, bringing the county's total to 414,185.\n\nUS officials have said they expect infection numbers to continue rising over the next few days because many people travelled over the Thanksgiving holiday, ignoring government advice.\"Travel volume was high over Thanksgiving,\"said Cindy Friedman, chief of the travellers' health branch at the CDC.\n\n\"Even if only a small percentage of those people were carrying the disease and passed it on to other people, that can translate into hundreds of thousands of additional infections.\"\n\nThe CDC has urged people to refrain from travel over Christmas.\n\nBut the public health body has also relaxed its guidelines for how long people should quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person - shortening it from 14 days to between seven and 10.\n\nAlthough the number of deaths is still rising, one set of brighter figures is that of deaths in relation to infections.\n\nThe CDC says the share of cases resulting in death fell from 6.7% in April to 1.9% in September, reflecting that health workers are now more successful in treating the disease.\n\nUS regulators are expected to meet on 10 December to discuss emergency approval for a vaccine developed by Moderna. They will meet again on 17 December to address another one made by Pfizer, which was approved this week in the UK.\n\nFederal officials at the CDC have agreed that the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups.\n\nThere are also concerns regarding how many Americans are willing to get vaccinated. A recent Gallup poll found that 58% said they would be willing, although this is up from a low of 50% in September.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday top Democratic lawmakers signalled support for a $908bn (\u00a3677bn) coronavirus relief framework - a major concession following months of deadlock with Republicans over policy disagreements.\n\nExact details of the framework have yet to be publicly disclosed, but it broadly includes funding for state and local governments, unemployment benefits, small businesses and other areas of the economy impacted by the outbreak.\nTL;DR: Record-high Covid infections and hospitalisations have been reported in the US, with fears they will not slow in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nArticle: By Caroline McClatchey and Kathryn WestcottBBC News\n\nFrom Hollywood superstars and comic book superheroes to leather-clad cowgirls and club-wielding cavemen, there are literally thousands of fancy dress outfits out there.\n\nIt is really very easy to avoid a controversial costume, but that does not seem to stop some people. And one of the most offensive outfits is a Nazi uniform, as Conservative MP Aidan Burley has discovered.\n\nThe MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire has been pictured in a national newspaper sitting next to another man dressed as an SS guard. Burley, who was on a stag do in a French ski resort at the time, has apologised for the\"clearly inappropriate behaviour\"of some of his friends.\n\nBut he is not the first person, and will surely not be the last, to hit the headlines over a Nazi costume.\n\nPrince Harry is perhaps the most famous Nazi fancy dress costume-wearer in the world. In 2005, he was pictured wearing a German desert uniform and a swastika armband at a friend's birthday party. The fancy dress theme was\"colonial and native\".\n\nIn September, spectators were left open-mouthed when pupils at a school in Thailand revealed their surprise outfits at the annual sports day. Many of the pupils were dressed in full Nazi regalia and were led into the sports ground by a young girl dressed as Adolf Hitler. Last year, a school in Australia apologised to parents after teachers awarded a costume prize to a child dressed as Hitler. \n\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the people who go to parties dressed as a Nazi, it is easy to find the outfits on the internet or in fancy dress shops.\n\nThe Party Superstore in Clapham, south London, used to have eight black SS uniforms, with swastika badge and armband, before it lost its stock in an arson attack during the August riots.\n\n\"We used to hire one or two a month. Most of them were for uniform parties, others for villains and heroes parties,\"says Kui Nim.\n\nThey are also a popular choice for murder mystery parties, stag dos and bad taste parties.\n\nBut a shop assistant at MadWorld fancy dress hire in London says staff will ask the customer why they want the outfit and will warn them against parading about in public.\n\n\"We advise them not to wear the outfit on their way to the party - for example, we would tell them not to wear it on the Tube - we wouldn't want people being attacked or anything.\"\n\nAn SS uniform would include jacket, trousers, shirt, tie and military insignia - such as skulls and swastikas, but not typically a swastika arm band. \n\nMilitary types would be able to spot the difference between the different uniforms of the SS, an elite fighting force who ran the death camps, and the Wehrmacht, Hitler's army, which is a popular choice for'Allo'Allo-themed parties.\n\nBut for the majority of people, all the German uniforms from the Nazi period have the same connotations.\n\nIt is for that reason that some fancy dress suppliers refuse to stock Nazi costumes.\n\nCostume designer Jackie Haynes, who owns the House of Haynes in Manchester, says she is missing out on profit but doesn't want to be associated with such a terrible period of history.\n\n\"Even if people do not have any dodgy motivations - they might want to go as Prince Harry - I wouldn't want to hire it out.\n\n\"I think it is a no-go area. You have to draw the line somewhere. It just turns my stomach. I don't think it's for partying.\"\n\nBut there is a time and a place for Nazi costumes - on a film set or theatre stage, in an exhibition or re-enactment.\n\nAngels, the UK's largest and longest-established costumiers, supplies the film, television and theatre industry. But it does not offer Nazi costumes to the party-going public because they are just\"bad taste\".\n\n\"The majority of people who want them certainly do not share Hitler's views, rather grew-up watching'Allo'Allo! and Dad's Army and think it might be funny, but most, upon reflection, realise that dressing in such a manner is guaranteed to offend rather than amuse,\"says chairman Tim Angel.\n\nMost costume shops would steer clear of providing anything that required certain military items, says Sylvia Luckman of the British Costume Association.\n\nSome people might require German military outfits for an'Allo,'Allo! party, in which case they would be able to find a plain grey military jacket. \n\n\"But many shops won't have swastikas. We certainly haven't seen them at any of the trade shows. This really changed after 1990, when a Dutch supplier attended a big show over here. \n\n\"There was a small stall selling German military regalia, such as armbands with swastikas on them. The Dutchman went berserk - he had lost family in the camps. He refused to supply anyone stocking such items.\"\n\nMs Luckman says there is no directive within the industry not to provide such items, but\"out of sheer common sense, it's a subject on which they tread carefully.\"\nTL;DR: A Conservative MP has apologised after reports he attended a stag party with Nazi overtones.

and revealing that information online, even in an innocent online post, could make you more vulnerable to hackers.\n\n\"I wouldn't do it,\"said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\n\"But it's difficult to tell people not to take part, as it is part of their social interaction and has become the norm.\n\n\"What I would say is to think very carefully about what you are putting into the public domain.\"\n\nProf Angela Sasse, director of the UK Research Institute in Science of Cyber-security, said she feels that the companies are to blame for any security breach rather than individuals.\n\n\"The risk is not so much publishing these lists, rather that somebody thinks it is a good idea to use questions like that as security credentials,\"she told the BBC.\n\n\"Companies are violating the security principle that the way of authenticating people should be private - such as a password or Pin number - rather than something that is publicly available.\"\n\nPeople are often warned not to post their holiday photos on social media sites in case it alerts potential burglars to the fact that their house is unoccupied.\n\nHowever, Prof Woodward said it is very difficult to prove if homes are targeted as a result of people showing their friends a picture of themselves on the beach.\n\n\"It is practically impossible to correlate numbers of burglaries of holidaymakers who are active on social media - but what is clear is the more personal information you put out there, the more is likely to be used by hackers.\"\n\n'Not stupid'\n\nThere had been some suggestions that the concerts question had been set up by the criminal underworld, but Prof Woodward dismissed that theory.\n\nHe told the BBC:\"This is not something that cyber-criminals would concoct -

These were seized by Soviet troops in the closing stages of World War II but are still claimed by Japan.\n\nA range of other island disputes flare up from time to time, notably in the South China Sea.\n\nThe motives are sometimes complex; economic concerns about competition for undersea oil or mineral rights are important in many cases; grand strategy plays a part too; and good old-fashioned nationalism is also often a factor.\n\nNaval power\n\nBut behind the headlines, larger forces are at work. Countries in the region are trying to adjust to the reality of an ever more assertive China. The United States is eager to reassert its role as a Pacific power; and Russia too, though in some ways a less central player, is also eager to remain part of the Asian equation.\n\nChina, of course, is the great changing presence in the region. Its economic rise has been dramatic. Its future trajectory, though, remains uncertain. Until now a rising China has pursued a rather muted foreign policy, seeing its engagement with the world as a means of ensuring its economic success.\n\nIt has, for example, built a network of relationships around the globe to ensure that it has the access to the raw materials that its hungry economy requires.\n\nHowever, now a new tone is creeping into China's engagement with the world. With success has come a new self-confidence; some might call it a new assertiveness. And this plays most strongly in its own backyard.\n\nIts row with Japan focuses on the Diaoyu/Senkaku island chain which, in strategic terms, acts as a barrier or choke-point channelling the Chinese Navy's access to the wider ocean.\n\nBeijing has made it clear that its maritime ambitions will not be contained in this way. It made it clear that Japan had to return its arrested sea captain straight away and Tokyo's rapid climbdown worried many other countries in the region.\n\nChina's growing naval power is a potent factor here as it develops a capacity to mount operations ever further from its own shores. \n\nIndeed, the fact that Beijing appeared willing to employ an economic weapon in its row with Japan - the interruption of the supply of rare earth metals (though Beijing denies that it employed its economic muscle in this way) caused further unease, and not just in Asia.\n\nThis new Chinese assertiveness explains the efforts of President Barack Obama's administration to bolster its regional role.\n\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been doing the rounds of key capitals in the wake of the East Asia summit in Hanoi and this is only a prelude to an increasingly important trip by President Obama himself this month.\n\nJapan in particular is eager to bolster its maritime alliance with Washington. China is equally eager to limit US engagement, pointedly turning down a US offer to mediate between it and Japan over its latest high-seas spat.\n\nThe rising tensions in the region pose all sorts of problems for Washington.\n\nIt wants to reassure traditional friends and encourage new alliances, while not seeking to explicitly isolate Beijing. \n\nThis would be a nonsense given the close integration of China with America and the wider global economy.\n\nWe are still far from the world suggested by a spate of thriller novels perhaps a decade or so ago which saw an inevitable path to superpower conflict between Washington and Beijing.\n\nNonetheless the tensions are there and managing them will be a growing challenge for diplomats on all sides.\nTL;DR: Over recent weeks some of the island chains that punctuate the Pacific Ocean off the mainland of Asia have provoked a series of diplomatic rows.\n\nArticle: St Edmund is thought to have been captured and killed by Danish or Viking raiders in AD869, but it is not known where he was killed or buried.\n\nSt Edmundsbury Cathedral has previously said he could be found in a former monks' graveyard beneath tennis courts in Bury St Edmunds' Abbey Gardens.\n\nHistoric England has granted permission for the courts to be relocated.\n\nSt Edmund ruled the Anglo-Saxon realm of East Anglia between AD855 and 869.\n\nMaldon in Essex and Hoxne in Suffolk have previously been thought to be the place where St Edmund died, and it has been said his remains were interred in France or Westminster Abbey.\n\nSt Edmundsbury Council has been granted scheduled monument consent by Historic England to move the tennis courts.\n\nThe council would not comment on whether the removal was related to the possible location of human remains but said it hoped work on new courts can begin after the completion of two consultancy studies of the Abbey of St Edmund in the autumn.\n\nEvidence gained from the results of both studies is likely be used to apply for funding for future projects, it said.\n\n'Long-term ambition'\n\nRobert Everitt, St Edmundsbury's cabinet member for families and communities, said:\"It would be wrong for us to pre-empt the results of these studies before making decisions about the rest of the area.\"\n\nThe council said the remnants of the former Eastgate plant nursery will be demolished and two new tennis courts will be constructed. \n\nIt said it is expected the new courts will be open by summer 2019. \n\nDr Will Fletcher, inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England in the East of England, said moving the tennis courts has been a\"long-term ambition\".\nTL;DR: Tennis courts underneath which it is thought England's former patron saint may be buried are to be moved.\n\nArticle: It is confirmation of 370 job losses, which first emerged last month.\n\nThe company said a voluntary separation programme would affect hourly and salaried employees.\n\nThe move, which Ford said was part of its ongoing actions to create a\"sustainably profitable business\"in Europe, will affect between 350 and 400 jobs.\n\nIt is nearly two years since fears of 1,160 job losses at the plant by 2021 emerged in a worse case scenario.\n\nA Ford spokesman said:\"The programme follows discussion with the union on matching the plant's labour requirements to the projected production volume expectations in the near term.\"\n\nUnions said they were told in January that 990 jobs would be cut in Bridgend by 2020 and pledged to fight compulsory redundancies. \n\nWorkers were told officially on Friday that they have three weeks to apply and those selected for redundancy will leave later this year.\n\nThe American-owned company announced plans last month for a major shake-up of its operations in the UK and mainland Europe.\n\nBridgend makes engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) but that contract finishes at the end of 2019, at around the same time the plant will stop making the Ford Ecoboost engine\n\nThe factory, which employs about 1,700 workers, won the investment for Ford's latest petrol engine -

Some \u00a3289m was paid in 2015-16; \u00a373m in 2012-13. \n\nA new\"surcharge\"for non-EU patients accounts for much of the rise, but only about half of debts owed are recovered.\n\nThe Department of Health said the increase showed\"very good progress\".\n\nNHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients. \n\n'Unreliable' data\n\nPeople from the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland, are usually covered by agreements such as the EHIC scheme - where their government is billed for their treatment - while those from outside the EEA are invoiced directly.\n\nBut the National Audit Office report estimated that only half of debts were recovered from patients from outside the EEA and found that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all.\n\nThe Department of Health's\"ambitious\"\u00a3500m recovery target was aimed at reducing NHS trusts' deficits, which reached \u00a32.45bn in 2015-16.\n\nThat year, an extra \u00a3164m was raised from a new \u00a3200-a-year surcharge on visa applications paid by temporary migrants from outside the EEA. \n\nThat year also saw a 53% increase on the amount NHS trusts in England charged directly to patients, mostly to visitors from outside the EEA - much of which is thought to be due to new rules that allow hospitals to charge up to 150% of the cost of treatment, rather than a case of more people being charged. \n\nAnd although amounts charged to people visiting from countries within the EEA increased slightly, they remain\"well below\"the ambition to recover \u00a3200m a year by 2017-18. The latest forecast for EEA income for that period is \u00a372m.\n\n'Good progress'\n\nThe report found some hospitals were better than others at recovering money - 10 NHS trusts in London accounted for half of the total amount charged to non-EEA patients in 2015-16. Twenty trusts said they had no patients using the EHIC scheme.\n\nIt praised the Department of Health for using IT systems to help trusts find patients who should be charged and for visiting 60 trusts to promote its\"cost recovery programme\", and said new financial incentives for reporting and charging overseas visitors had had an effect.\n\nBut it estimated that\"trusts recover around half of the amounts they charge directly to patients, mainly visitors from outside the EEA\", with recovery rates varying widely - and it was not really understood why.\n\nHead of the National Audit Office, Amyas Morse said:\"Hospital trusts remain some way from complying in full with the requirement to charge and recover the cost of treating overseas visitors.\"\n\nHe said much of the increase in amounts charged and recovered over the past two years was due to changes to charging rules:\"If current trends continue and the charging rules remain the same, the department will not achieve its ambition of recovering up to \u00a3500m of overseas visitor income a year by 2017-18.\"\n\nA Department of Health spokeswoman said:\"This government was the first to put in place measures to ensure the NHS isn't abused, and as this report finds, we are making very good progress - the amount of income recovered has already more than trebled in three years to \u00a3289m.\n\n\"We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS to other areas of healthcare.\n\n\"We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover \u00a3500m a year by the middle of this parliament.\"\nTL;DR: The government is expected to fall well short of its target of recovering \u00a3500m a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England.\n\nArticle: There were 100 fewer people registered with the Employment and Social Security Department than in November, which put the total at 1,210.\n\nIt is at its lowest total for six months but is still 90 people higher than the previous December.\n\nThe latest figures show almost two thirds of those on the department's books were getting Income Support, a total of 840 people.\n\nA quarter of those defined as actively seeking work were teenagers aged between 16 and 19.\n\nOf the 320 teenagers, 140 were on the Advance to Work Scheme.\n\nBut the Skills Executive is encouraged by the figures and says almost half of those who came off the register in December were aged between 16 and 24.\n\nOverall about a third of those out of work are in what are known as Elementary Occupations.\n\nThose include farm workers, postal staff, those in catering and hospitality and cleaners.\nTL;DR: The number of people without a job in Jersey fell over Christmas.\n\nArticle: By Heather ChenBBC News\n\nUS gaming giant Blizzard Entertainment has released a special update for its newest game Overwatch in time for the festivities, and it's using China's most revered literary tale to keep players interested and boost sales.\n\nTitled'Overwatch: Year of the Rooster', players can don cosmetic\"skins\"modelled after the four main characters from Journey to the West, a story most Chinese children grow up hearing, about a legendary pilgrimage of a Buddhist monk and his three disciples.\n\nSpecial holiday items and a new game mode were also made available through special New Year Loot Boxes, each priced between $2 and $45 (\u00a31.75 - \u00a335). \n\nThe firm's other fantasy titles such as Heroes of the Storm, StarCraft and World of Warcraft (WoW) also received festive updates. \n\nOverwatch has also attracted a mammoth following in South Korea, overtaking League of Legends to become the country's most-popular online game.\n\nChina is one of Blizzard's biggest markets. Although the firm has not provided official Chinese player numbers for Overwatch, gamers in the country have been estimated to make up about half of its five million players worldwide for the WoW franchise.\n\nReleased in May 2016, the first-person shooter game has reportedly gained a loyal following of over 20m registered players. \n\nEach battle has two teams of six gamers, and players, represented in the game by a\"hero\"character, have to secure and defend various points on an online map before time runs out. \n\nCosmetic rewards like individual victory poses and the special Lunar New Year character skins are a popular feature of the game.

I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me.\"\n\nAs for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a\"friend of mine\"and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit.\n\n\"He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him.\"\n\nThe ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the\"Brexit dream was dying\", has spoken of his\"increasing admiration\"for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. \n\nAsked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a\"positive impression\".\n\nHe said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington.  \n\nThe BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. \n\nDuring his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle.\n\nProtests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. \n\nMrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him.\n\nAfter being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a\"dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world\".\n\nMr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. \n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no\"hard border\"on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough.\n\n\"If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,\"he told the Irish Parliament.\"I think perhaps we are now entering into that space.\"\n\nAnd speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a\"very ambitious\"free trade deal with the UK. \n\nThe Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence.\n\nMr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to\"protect\"Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. \n\nThe US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets.  \n\nBut Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, hit back, saying the EU spent more on defence than either Russia or China.\nTL;DR: The UK is in \"turmoil\" and \"it is up to the people\" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister, Donald Trump has said ahead of his first visit to the country as US President.\n\nArticle: The Woman in Black: Angels of Death takes place 40 years on from the spooky events of the first movie.\n\nThat one, starring Daniel Radcliffe, has made \u00a375m worldwide so far.\n\nHammer will produce the movie, adapted from a story by author Susan Hill which follows a couple encountering the haunted Eel Marsh House.\n\nThe Woman in Black, which was directed by James Watkins and adapted by Kick-Ass screenwriter Jane Goldman, sat at the number one spot at the UK box office for three weeks.\n\nThe new film will be adapted by Jon Crocker.\n\nHammer Films president Simon Oakes said:\"We are proud and honoured to be working with Susan again on The Woman in Black: Angels Of Death, a wonderful new tale every bit as atmospheric and terrifying as its predecessor.\"\n\nHammer also recently announced two more films going into production this year - The Quiet Ones and Gaslight, both of which will shoot in the UK.\nTL;DR: The Woman In Black is to get a sequel, after the first instalment became the highest-grossing British horror film of the past 20 years.\n\nArticle: The Island Line between Ryde and Shanklin, which can only run using old tube trains, could be dug up to be replaced with the\"light rail\"service.\n\nWith passenger numbers falling and annual \u00a33.5m losses, trams would be more\"efficient\"and\"low cost\".\n\nThe report comes after the government announced plans to remove the service from the next regional train franchise.\n\nThe track and entire 1938 train stock on the Island Line needs replacing, but only London Underground trains can run on the line because of the height of Ryde tunnel.\n\nThe next second-hand tube trains small enough to fit through the tunnel will not be available for another decade. \n\nThe service, which costs an annual \u00a34.5m to run for a \u00a31m return, depends on subsidies from other profitable parts of the rail network.\n\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said bidders for the next South Western rail franchise would be asked to turn the line into a self-sustaining business.\n\nAuthor of the independent report, Christopher Garnet, a rail expert who lives on the island, was asked by the Isle of Wight Council to come up with cost-effective ways to keep the service running.\n\nHe said:\"Trams are cheaper to operate than trains, and it might well be a low cost solution going forward.\"\n\nHe said overhead power wires, with simplified signalling, would cost no more than refurbishing the route to mainline standards.\n\nCouncil leader Jonathan Bacon said the tram option would\"significantly reduce costs but still make for an efficient and quick service that provides the link that we need\".\n\nThe report's findings will be discussed by councillors this month.\n\nThe line runs 8.5 miles (13.7km) from Shanklin to Ryde Pier Head, where it connects with passenger ferries to Portsmouth Harbour.\n\nPaul Clifton - BBC South transport correspondent \n\nThe tube trains are almost 80-years-old - twice the age of any other rolling stock in daily use. Spare parts are hard to come by, and these museum pieces really cannot rattle on much longer. \n\nThe track is rough: the trains bounce around. It wouldn't be acceptable anywhere else. For decades the policy here has been to patch and mend.\n\nChristopher Garnett believes replacing ancient trains with second-hand trams is financially viable.\n\nOverhead power lines would be needed, and fitting them in Ryde tunnel would be a tight squeeze. But trams would be much cheaper to run. So if the line has to be refurbished anyway, doing it for trams instead of trains makes sense.\nTL;DR: Trams could be the answer to saving a dilapidated Isle of Wight rail line, a council-commissioned report has stated.\n\nArticle: By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland news website\n\nMorrison is a hugely successful author who has written four much-lauded novels as well as other critically acclaimed works such as last year's Tales From a Mall, but he says he finds it very hard to believe that people like or appreciate him.\n\nHe says:\"I find it so hard to accept that in the last few years I have given up alcohol and put myself in therapy because I have to grapple with my belonging in the normal world. I find it upsetting that I'm here and I'm doing well.\"\n\n'Incapacitating stutter'\n\nNow 46, Morrison puts his inability to fit in down to his childhood in Caithness, where his hippy parents struggled to live the Utopian cultural life they had fled to the far north to build. \n\nHis father David was the local librarian and ran the Wick festival of poetry, folk and jazz which attracted cultural giants such as Norman MacCaig and Iain Crichton Smith but often failed to find audiences to match.\n\n\"My father hit the bottle when he realised the festival would not work. It was this big 60s dream, one that ruined our family economics,\"Morrison says. \n\n\"Watching your parents fail is pretty crushing.\"\n\nIn his 30s, he says, he had to deal with\"severe anger and rage\"against his\"irresponsible\"parents who tried to live outside the real world but abandoned their son to deal with the bullies from the tough working-class town who made his life a misery.\n\nMorrison told BBC Scotland's Stark Talk:\"I had an incapacitating stutter where I could not say my own name from the age of about nine to 13. \n\n\"I was systematically bullied for about three or four years to the point where I gave in and just accepted it would be a daily phenomena.\"\n\nMorrison says he was kicked in the head, forced to eat dirt, stripped and on one occasion he remembers having to stand with his mouth open while the bullies attempted to spit into it from a distance.\n\nHe says he used to long for the day when the nearby Dounreay nuclear power station would blow up and the entire community would be destroyed.\n\nThe teenage Morrison found some kind of relief in making figures from modelling clay. \n\n\"On a bad day I would literally crush a Plasticine model and kill someone,\"he says.\n\nHis self-confidence grew through his talent for art and he went on to Glasgow School of Art, which he says was\"a wonderful place for freaks\".\n\nHe was a good artist but too impatient, always moving on to the next thing like a\"butterfly\".\n\nAt first he was a portrait painter, then changed to photography and he graduated making art documentaries.\n\nOne of his novels, Menage, sees his protagonists learning how to express their art.\n\nMorrison says:\"One of the pieces in the book was my actual graduation piece where I slapped about a good friend of mine. \n\n\"He's now a really successful artist living in Finland by the name of Charles Sanderson and he sat still for an hour while I slapped him and my friends kissed him and that became a portrait.\"\n\nLove triangle\n\nMenage, as the name suggests, features a love triangle, and it is not only Morrison novel in which explicit sex is a feature.\n\nIt was his first book, a collection of short stories called The Last Book That You Read, which had him dubbed a\"Scottish purveyor erudite filth\"by Arena magazine.\n\nA couple of years later his first novel, Swung, told of the swinging scene in Glasgow, a lifestyle choice with multiple sex partners, into which Morrison delved after his marriage broke down.\n\nHe says he\"cracked up\"in New York at the turn of the millennium when a film project he had been working on for two years collapsed.\n\nHis\"dangerous, alcohol-fuelled behaviour\"resulted in him losing his wife, his two children and his home.\n\n\"I went nuts,\"says Morrison. \n\n\"I had so much resting on wanting to make this film in America to show that I could stand on my own two feet, put all my past behind me, almost start again in another world.\n\n\"When all that fell through I was stuck back in Scotland. I felt I was stuck in this place I had so desperately wanted to escape from.\"\n\nBack in Glasgow, he turned to writing and in order to get material for his books, he lived\"more extremely\"than he would have done other wise, examining the swinging scene by spending a\"year in perverse\".\n\n\"I think most people who are involved in swinging are troubled,\"he says.\n\nHappy-ending\n\nHowever, in its defence he says swinging\"demystifies\"the rituals around sex and crosses cultural and class boundaries.\n\nIn 2006 when he met his future wife, Swung was still in draft form and he gave it to her to read. \n\nHe says his now-wife, who was a lesbian for 10 years, was not really afraid of the content. \n\n\"If anything I think she might have thought it was too bourgeois and heterosexual,\"he says.\n\nMorrison's 2008 novel Distance tells of two people clinging on to a long-distance relationship. \n\nThe male character Tom is unstable, volatile, suicidal, needy, feels inadequate, and he is an alcoholic.\n\n\"All my characters are a bit of me but pushed to limits so there was part of me that was all those things,\"Morrison says. \n\n\"I probably made the mistake of digging as darkly as I could into the rot inside myself for that book.\"\n\nLike the characters in Distance, Morrison and his American wife Emily conducted a long-distance relationship for two years before she eventually moved to the UK.\n\nMorrison says it has resulted in a happy-ending which he could not have dared to write in his novel.\n\nSo, is Morrison finally happy?\n\nHe says:\"I used to wonder why I hated Henri Matisse when I was in art school and I think it was because Matisse was happy.\n\n\"I think I would like to be a bit more like Matisse in future, more calm and self-assured and to create things which are not just about being screwed up.\"\n\nStark Talk is on BBC Radio Scotland on Tuesday 20 May at 13:30.\nTL;DR: Ewan Morrison has in the past been called a \"purveyor of erudite filth\".

since the crisis began.\n\nTheir work has supported those in need and provided a vital link to people in isolation.\n\nIain Lendrum said he started the group after he explained to his parents they would need to self-isolate and they asked who was going to look after their friends.\n\n\"That's where I thought:'Who's going to help these people who've got no family around them?'\"\n\nAbout 20 people went to a meeting held just before the lockdown in March, and the Fivemiletown Coronavirus Support Group was formed. \n\nIt started out by delivering groceries and medicines, as well as shielding packs from Mid-Ulster District Council. \n\nIt set up a food bank to help people who were furloughed or who had lost their jobs.\n\nPersonal Protection Equipment (PPE) was sourced and distributed to local healthcare workers and GP surgeries.\n\n\"A number of elderly people did raise the issue that the local caf\u00e9s were closed and they felt they couldn't get meals,\"Mr Lendrum explained.\n\n\"While initially we didn't want to get involved in delivering meals, we felt the need was there from the community.\"\n\nWith the support of a local butcher, the group started out with 180 meals for the elderly and vulnerable members of the community. \n\nThat soon grew to more than 300 meals which a team of volunteers would collect and deliver every Saturday.\n\nMr Lendrum said it had helped\"the mental well-being and the morale of the local community\". \n\n\"The elderly people are sitting waiting on you coming on a Saturday,\"he said.\n\n\"They might be the only person

There's even talk among some commentators of an\"L-shaped\"recovery: in other words, no recovery at all.\n\nMr Sunak's stark message comes as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases figures for April, the first full month of the lockdown, showing a sharp rise in the number of people unemployed and claiming benefit, prompting expectations next month's figures will show a far bigger jump towards a different order of magnitude altogether.\n\nYou would have thought\"unemployment soaring\"would have been a safe conclusion for the headline writers to draw from all this.\n\nWe all know it's true, not least because initial hopes the government's furlough scheme for employers to keep jobs alive at taxpayers' expense  are now giving way to a weary resignation that in many cases it is merely delaying the inevitable. That there may even be no employer for those unfortunate people to go back to.\n\nBut not so fast!\n\n\"No, you can't say the ONS numbers show unemployment is rising\", counter the purists who point out it is the claimant count that has gone up, largely because of people who are now eligible for benefits due to the CV19 crisis who previously were not. \n\nWhat's more, the ONS's own figures show the UK unemployment rate actually fell from 4% in the last quarter of last year to 3.9% during the first quarter of this. Two hundred and eleven thousand more people were employed during Q1 2020 compared with Q4 2019.\n\nSo that simple headline\"unemployment soaring\"could be considered technically inaccurate. Even though we all know how painfully true it is. \n\nWho was it who coined the phrase\"Lies, damned lies and statistics\"? There's even an argument about that. Was it the Nineteenth Century Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli or his successor during the early years of the Twentieth, Arthur Balfour?\n\nWho will be hardest-hit?\n\nAmple evidence indicates that, as in the last major crisis following the financial crash, it will be people on lower earnings who will again suffer the worst of this. Also, depressingly, younger people along with older workers in their 50s and 60s. Switching to a geographical focus, the West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street, is worried that our industrial heartlands, always especially exposed to economic ups and downs,  will face the biggest rebuilding job.  \n\nThis is why he plans to head a West Midlands Economic Recovery Board with mounting speculation the government may be about to sign off on some form of ministerial participation in it. Mr Street may draw at least a crumb of comfort from some number-crunching by the campaigning organisation the Centre for Cities (CfC). While the ONS were compiling their claimants' statistics, the CfC were updating their absolute unemployment numbers for our cities and towns.\n\nYou can see the CfC chart by clicking here.\n\nTelford in Shropshire heads our contingent in ninth place. Then you have to go down as far as 21st for Birmingham, 42nd for Gloucester, 45th for Stoke-on-Trent and 56th for Coventry, with these last two registering percentage point increases between March and April below the UK average of 2%.\n\nEvery one of these numbers carries a heavy human toll of course. But they also provide some overdue perspective suggesting where our part of the country stands in the over all scheme of things.\n\nNo wonder the pressure is building on ministers to respond to the collateral effects of the government-imposed Covid lockdown. Worried about the effects on other patients suffering from, say, heart conditions or cancer, one hospital doctor told me recently\"we're buying lives with lives\". \n\nWe are also buying lives with jobs.\n\nWhen Boris Johnson quoted his classical hero Cicero to declare\"life comes first\", he could present it as a simple black and white political question.

That has been increased to \u00a3280m but with a cap on the number of drugs which can be made available.\n\nIt has not been clear before now what might happen to the Fund, which is run for patients in England,  after the 2015/16 financial year, the last in which firm financing has been committed.  \n\nLabour has now come out with a pledge, if elected in May next year, to continue the work of the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) but to rebrand it and include treatment such as advanced radiotherapy as well as drugs.  \n\nThe annual budget, under Labour's plan, would be increased from \u00a3280m to \u00a3330m.\n\nLabour's Andy Burnham argues that it is perverse for the CDF to pay for expensive drugs which are not available on the NHS but not treatments. \n\nLabour that 40,000 cancer patients each year stand to benefit from radiotherapy which they don't currently receive. \n\nBut Labour's plan raises the question of how rising demand can be met if the Fund is expanded to include treatments as well as drugs.  Mr Burnham's extra \u00a350m a year might be accounted for quickly and still leave oncologists and their patients feeling short-changed.\n\nThe funding for these cancer measures has come under scrutiny. \n\nLabour wants to use a rebate from the pharmaceutical industry after a deal with the companies to cap the NHS medicines budget.  But the Conservatives say the money has already been committed to the NHS.  In other words, if Labour wants to re-direct it to the newly relaunched Cancer Drugs Fund, something else will have to be cut.\n\nSo what's the Conservative plan for the next parliament?  \n\nThe Fund is of course David Cameron's baby, his personal initiative after taking office in 2010.  \n\nGovernment sources make it clear that Mr Cameron is committed to continuing the Fund from 2016 if he is still Prime Minister after the election. Technically, though, it is not yet a Conservative manifesto pledge.\n\nAll this begs a question - what do the pharmaceutical industry think?  Some drug companies don't like the Cancer Drugs Fund. They believe the watchdog National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) should authorise a wider range of new drugs to bring availability of cancer drugs on the NHS into line with many other countries.  Other pharma players are happy to do business with the CDF, aware that the prices they can charge are not controlled (though that will change when the restrictions take effect next year). \n\nAnother complication has just emerged.  \n\nI understand that the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the trade body for drug companies, is not happy that politicians pledge money from the rebate deal to specific schemes.  They say the arrangement was for the money to be ploughed back into general front line NHS services. Their unhappiness is both towards Labour for earmarking cash for their Cancer Drugs Fund plan and the Government for increasing the CDF from \u00a3200 million to \u00a3280 million.

The university has had an outstanding record of academic achievement.\"\nTL;DR: The new principal and vice chancellor of the University of Aberdeen has been named.\n\nArticle: Requests for state aid are also expected from other airlines. \n\nThe government has said it will only step in to help struggling airlines\"as a last resort\"on a case-by-case basis. \n\nHowever, the Transport Secretary told MPs he can't rule out the state taking an ownership stake in UK airlines that have been battered by coronavirus.\n\nGrant Shapps told MPs on the Transport Select Committee that nothing had been ruled out in its response to coronavirus for the aviation sector.\n\nAsked by Labour MP Ruth Cadbury if the government would consider buying a share of UK airlines that face collapse, Mr Shapps said:\"It was important to save companies that would survive in normal times.\n\nHowever, the Transport Secretary said current shareholders\"must be part of the solution\". \n\nUK-based airlines have already announced measures to save money such as temporarily laying-off staff. \n\nVirgin Atlantic had previously suggested the government offer UK carriers \u00a37.5 billion in credit facilities.\n\nThe airline's founder Sir Richard Branson this week offered to inject \u00a3250 million into the Virgin Group, with most of that amount going to the airline.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nThe vast bulk of flights to and from the UK have been grounded amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nSome airlines like British Airways are still operating a number of rescue flights to bring stranded Brits home.\n\nEarlier this week, the government said it would not deliver a financial aid package for the aviation industry, but its emergency business measures, including a Bank of England scheme for firms to raise capital and employee wage subsidies, were available for airlines.\n\nBut industry group the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned of an\"apocalypse\"in the aviation sector as it called on governments around the world for help.\n\nThe US Senate on Wednesday passed a $58 billion (\u00a346.6 billion) aid package for its airline industry, which included cash for paying pilot, crew and staff salaries.\n\nTo bail out, or not bail out?\n\nYou'd be forgiven for being confused about whether the government is going to bailout UK-based airlines, or not. \n\nFirst ministers indicated that an industry-wide bailout was on the cards. \n\nVirgin Atlantic went public and said \u00a37.5bn was needed. \n\nBut then an about turn from the Chancellor.\n\nRishi Sunak wrote to airlines and airports telling them that an industry-wide emergency rescue package for the aviation industry wasn't on its way after all. \n\nWhat the government is offering is bespoke financial support on a case-by-case basis, but only once airlines have exhausted all other options.\n\nMinisters want to be sure that wealthy shareholders play their part. \n\nThe other reason an industry-wide package didn't happen was because the airlines involved are ultimately rivals and where as some of them were champing at the bit for a government loan, others were against it. \n\nThe more cash-rich the airline, the less keen on a bailout. \n\nAnd, for some, cash is the immediate problem.\nTL;DR: Virgin Atlantic is expected to ask for a government bailout worth hundreds of millions of pounds in the coming days, the BBC understands.\n\nArticle: PATIENCE TAYO AWE -

They are expected to vote on both articles of impeachment afterwards. \n\nIn her opening remarks Ms Pelosi said it was\"tragic\"that the president's\"reckless actions\"had led to impeachment but said he had left lawmakers with\"no choice\".\n\n\"The president is an ongoing threat to our national security, and the integrity of our elections, the basis of our democracy,\"she said.\n\nBut Republicans hit back. Lawmaker Doug Collins from Georgia said Mr Trump had done\"nothing wrong\"and that Democrats wanted to impeach him because they were afraid to face him in next year's election.\n\n\"They said we can't beat him if we don't impeach him. The American people will see through this,\"he said.\n\nMeanwhile Debbie Lesko, a Republican from Arizona, said it was the\"most partisan impeachment\"in US history.\n\nSurveys suggest the country is split on the process. US political website FiveThirtyEight's collection of national polls shows just over 47% back impeachment, while 46.4% oppose it.\n\nHow will the vote play out?\n\nThe vote in the Democratic-controlled House is expected to fall almost entirely along party lines.\n\nNearly 200 Republicans are united in opposition, except for one lawmaker, Florida's Francis Rooney, who is retiring and has not ruled out siding with Democrats.\n\nAll but a handful of the 233 House Democrats have said they will back impeachment - about 216 votes are needed for the measure to pass by a simple majority in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nThe yeses include most of the 31 Democratic lawmakers who represent districts won by Mr Trump in 2016.\n\nCollin Peterson, of Minnesota, and Jeff Van Drew, of New Jersey, have indicated they will vote no. Mr Van Drew plans to become a Republican. \n\nJared Golden, of Maine, said he would vote to impeach on one charge, not both.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment against Mr Trump last week.\n\nThe first is abuse of power. It accuses the president of trying to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rival, Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. \n\nMr Trump and his conservative allies have alleged without evidence that while he was US vice-president, Joe Biden encouraged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in order to stop him investigating a Ukrainian gas company that employed his son, Hunter Biden, as a board member. \n\nDemocrats say Mr Trump dangled $400m of US military aid and the prospect of a coveted White House meeting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as bargaining chips to prod the US ally into announcing a corruption inquiry into the Bidens.\n\nThe second charge is obstructing Congress. Mr Trump, who blocked his aides from testifying, is accused of failing to co-operate with the House impeachment investigation.\n\nThe president has denied withholding US aid to benefit himself politically and maintains it was appropriate to ask Ukraine to look into alleged corruption. \n\nUnder the US constitution, a president\"shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanours\". It is a political process, not a legal one. \n\nWhat will happen in the Senate?\n\nOnce Mr Trump is formally impeached by the House as expected, proceedings will go on to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial in January. \n\nIf two-thirds of senators voted to convict the president, he would be removed from office. But Democrats can only muster 47 votes in the 100-seat upper chamber, and they need 67 to pass the measure.\n\nNo-one expects at least 20 of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans to join with Democrats and end his presidency.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he was under no obligation to be even-handed in his management of the proceeding.\n\n\"I'm not an impartial juror,\"the Kentucky senator told reporters.\"This is a political process. I'm not impartial about this at all.\"\n\nMr McConnell rebuffed calls from the Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, to summon top White House officials for the trial.\n\nWhat is the precedent?\n\nTwo US presidents have been impeached - Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 - but in both cases the Senate did not vote to force them from office.\n\nRichard Nixon resigned the presidency in August 1974 when it became clear he would be impeached and ousted by Congress in the wake of the Watergate scandal.\n\nWant to find out more?\nTL;DR: Donald Trump is expected to

179-year-old station and the roof refurbished.\n\nMr Redgewell, of passenger group South West Transport Network, was speaking at a West of England Combined Authority meeting to discuss the

Reporting Service and published by Bristol Live.\n\n'Leave us out of it'\n\nIn an open letter to Mr Redgewell on Twitter, Poundland said it was\"somewhat irritated\"by his description, and said its

Shelter said the\"decisive action\"would help thousands of renters. \n\nA similar ban in England and Wales is due to end later this month. \n\nIn England, ministers have said allowing eviction hearings to resume is an important step towards protecting landlords' rights. \n\nThe Welsh Government has announced a \u00a38m loan scheme for private sector tenants who have built up rent arrears during the pandemic.\n\nThe ban on new evictions in England and Wales, for both social and private renters, is now due to be lifted on 23 August. \n\nIt was originally due to finish at the end of June before being extended for two months. \n\nThe government has said new repossession rules in England will provide appropriate protection for renters after eviction court hearings resume. \n\nUnder the new rules, landlords will have to say how the pandemic has affected their tenants financially when applying for a hearing. \n\nThey will also be required to produce a tenant's full rent arrears history in advance of proceedings, rather than at the hearing itself. \n\nBut Labour has branded the new rules\"toothless\"and called for emergency protection to strengthen protection for renters. \n\nMs Sturgeon said extending the eviction ban in Scotland would help stop people becoming homeless as a result of the pandemic. \n\nThe move will require the consent of the Scottish Parliament but is unlikely to be blocked. \n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, the SNP leader said it showed Scottish ministers were doing\"everything we can\"to protect renters. \n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the move would\"help thousands keep a roof over their head\". \n\n\"It's really encouraging to see the Scottish and Welsh governments taking decisive action to protect renters,\"she said.\n\nShe called for ministers in England to give judges\"new powers to ensure no renter is made homeless because of Covid-19\"when Parliament returns from its summer recess in early September. \n\nJon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis, said the Scottish government had shown\"real leadership\"by prolonging the evictions ban. \n\nHe added that it would provide renters with\"much-needed breathing space\"whilst they deal with pandemic-related financial difficulties. \n\nIn response to the proposal to extend the ban in Scotland, the National Residential Landlords Association said any move to do so in England and Wales was\"not necessary\". \n\nIts deputy director of policy and research John Stewart said its research showed the\"vast majority\"of landlords and tenants were\"working together constructively to sustain tenancies\". \n\n\"Over 95 per cent of tenants are paying their rent or have made an arrangement with their landlord to avoid arrears,\"he added. \n\n\"We need the courts to deal with cases where tenants are committing anti-social behaviour or there are long-standing rent arrears that have nothing to do with the pandemic. \n\n\"Over the last five months landlords have been powerless to take any action against those who cause misery for fellow tenants and neighbours.\"\nTL;DR: Housing charities have welcomed a proposal for a six-month extension to Scotland's ban on

He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted.\n\nIt will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market.\n\nThere may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections.\n\nBut he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally. \n\nThe US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time.  \n\nHowever, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nThe Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal.\n\nMeredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a\"cosmetic concession\"so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact.\n\nShe said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals.  \n\n\"If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],\"she said,\n\nCanadian dairy farmers were critical. \"We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,\"said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada.\n\nHowever, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said:\"It's a good day for Canada\". \n\nMexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said it was a good deal for his country and North America.\n\nThe aim is for the agreement to be signed before Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on 1 December.\nTL;DR: The US and Canada have reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\n\nArticle: Liverpool City Council wanted to create the facility in the Cunard Building, which it purchased for about \u00a310m.\n\nBut mayor Joe Anderson said the regeneration plan will not proceed due to the cost of satisfying border control requirements.\n\nMr Anderson said he had been advised the project could cost\"up to \u00a315m\".\n\nHe said the council is now speaking to developers about creating a terminal on an alternative site, not far from the Cunard building.\n\nThe Grade II-listed building, one of the city's\"Three Graces\", housed the headquarters and terminal for the Cunard cruise line until the 1990s, and has since been used as office space.\n\nIt was purchased from the Merseyside Pension Fund last year, and is currently occupied by a number of small companies.\n\nIt was hoped creating the terminal would boost tourism and investment in the city.\n\nHowever, Mr Anderson said the council had chosen to shelve the project due to the associated cost of creating secure check-in and border control facilities required by the Home Office.\n\nA particular difficulty would have been creating a secure passage for passengers between the terminal and the embarking point, he said.\n\n\"The sort of logistics of trying to get people from the Cunard Building to where we've got the berth is not feasible and financially impractical,\"he said.\n\n\"Yes, it's hugely disappointing that we can't use the Cunard Building.

We don't know yet whether there will be full bodies in this chamber, or nearby chambers. \n\n\"The number of finds from a single fossil locality is unprecedented. There are apparently three small babies and three small children, some older children as well as some adults.\"\n\nNHM visitors will get to see a model of a skull. There are also examples of a hand, a foot, and some jaws.\n\nThey are all small because, even as adults, naledi is diminutive, perhaps standing no taller than about 1.5m (5ft). \n\nWits University has previously shared casts of other fossils it is working on, including those of a more ancient creature called Australopithecus sediba, which was also found in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site in Gauteng province. These too will be available on Friday to compare and contrast.\n\nDeep debate\n\nThere are probably two major unanswered questions surrounding H. naledi at the moment.\n\nOne concerns the age of the fossils. If any dating technique has been used to try to establish this, the results have not been released. \n\nCurrently, it is being assumed they are very ancient - maybe a couple of million years old - purely on the basis that some features seen in the bones look very primitive.\n\nThe second major question centres on what the remains were doing in the Rising Star cave complex.\n\nThe Wits team has mooted the possibility that naledi may have disposed of its dead there deliberately. That is a remarkable proposition if the creature is as old as has been suggested.\n\nBut it is perplexing to think how so many individuals could navigate their way into such a deep cave.  \n\nThe scientists found the remains in an opening at the bottom of a very narrow chute. But even to get to the chute, the researchers had to crawl through other narrow gaps and make some steep climbs.\n\nHow naledi managed this is inexplicable. It is unlikely this creature had access to torches; controlled use of fire came much later in history.\n\nAlready, some furious arguments have surfaced over the interpretations put forward by the Wits team. \n\nRival researchers have even questioned whether the fossil haul actually represents two or more different species, or just a slightly different version of a species we have seen before.\n\n\"Not everyone is going to agree with Lee Berger's team.

Bishop Auckland, County Durham, was bought by developer Carlauren for \u00a3850,000 in 2017.\n\nIt planned to turn it into a luxury care home and investors from around the world bought into the project.\n\nIt was due to open in a few months but work has stopped and the income paid out to investors has dried up.\n\nCarlauren promised to turn the Grade II-listed building into a care home offering residents a\"high quality country house hotel experience\".\n\nInvestors came from all over the world on a promise of a regular income that would be paid for from care home residents' fees.\n\nLand registry records showed they came from London, across Europe, Africa, India, China and the Far East, and ranged from a Saudi Princess to a Wiltshire pensioner.\n\nWindlestone Hall history\n\nThe BBC Inside Out programme found 53 units were sold with a total value of \u00a38.5m.\n\nIncome was paid out monthly, even though the property was still derelict, with no care home facilities or residents.\n\nThe first investors knew about this was when payments dried up in the spring.\n\nSouth African businessman Bertus Van Jaarsveld paid \u00a3164,000 for one unit.\n\nHe told the BBC:\"Up until [the money stopped] I had no reason to dig into the company or look any deeper. \n\n\"Now that it's all come to light you can see that they've been selling more rooms than they actually have in the property.\n\n\"And the way that the money wasn't used for renovations... obviously that's when I realised it wasn't being managed the way it should be.\"\n\n'Lucky to get 10%'\n\nInside Out also found the same company bought Highnam, a former care home in Hartlepool that closed after being declared unsafe. \n\nDespite there being no planning permission or works carried out, 30 luxury care units in the 25-bed facility were sold for a total of \u00a32.5m.\n\nWalter Funk, an investor from South Africa, said his payments stopped\"about six months ago\".\n\n\"In the emails they apologised saying there has been a delay in payments\", he said.\n\n\"But then there was no reply to the email I responded to, and I thought'oh oh'.\"\n\nHe said he thought he would be\"lucky\"if he got back 10% of the \u00a3250,000 he was owed.\n\nCarlauren sold units at another 23 similar properties in the UK  - all pitched to investors as care homes or hotels.\n\nThey have resulted in a total of \u00a376m of investors' cash, but not a single one is operating as a care home.\n\nLater this month administrators representing many of Carlauren's investors are going to court in a bid to claw back some of their missing money.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nThe company's owner and chief executive Sean Murray lives on the south coast, has a luxury yacht and a fleet

correspondent\n\nPhoenix is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to stay in the air indefinitely using a new type of propulsion.  \n\nDespite being 15m (50ft) long with a mass of 120kg (19 stone) she rises gracefully into the air.  \n\nShe looks a little like an airship, except airships don't have wings.  \n\n\"It's a proper aeroplane,\"says the UHI's Professor Andrew Rae.  \n\nAs the project's chief engineer, he has overseen the integration of Phoenix's systems.  \n\n\"It flies under its own propulsion although it has no engines,\"he says.  \n\n\"The central fuselage is filled with helium, which makes it buoyant so it can ascend like a balloon.  \n\n\"And inside that there's another bag with compressors on it that brings air from outside, compresses the air, which makes the aeroplane heavier and then it descends like a glider.\" \n\nLaunch satellites\n\nThis ability to\"breathe\"- to switch quickly between being heavier or lighter than air - doesn't just make the plane go up and down.  \n\nIt is the key to driving it forward.  Phoenix is the first large-scale aircraft to be powered by variable-buoyancy propulsion.  \n\nIt moves through the air like a porpoise through water.  \n\nThat means it can travel long distances and stay aloft for long periods.  \n\nThe point? To create a cheaper alternative to launching satellites.  \n\nThe wings and tail carry solar panels so there is no need to carry fuel aloft.  \n\nThe quasi-airship shape is based on an aerofoil, meaning it also provides lift like its wings do when the plane moves forward.  \n\nProf Rae, using two wind tunnels at UHI's Perth College campus, led the design of its aerodynamics.  \n\nThe technique of variable-buoyancy propulsion is already used underwater. \n\nThe Scottish Association for Marine Science (also part of UHI) has a small fleet of remotely operated vehicles - they call them gliders - that gather data in the North Atlantic.  \n\nThey dive deep to collect data, then rise to the surface to transmit it via satellite.  \n\nBut air is much less dense than water and this has made the principle a trickier proposition for flight.  \n\nPhoenix is the first aircraft of its size to use it.  \n\nIt is 15m (49ft) long with a wingspan of almost 11m (36ft) \n\nProduction versions would need to be scaled up to reach the altitudes of 20km required to fulfil its intended role.  \n\nAn autonomous vehicle which is self-sufficient in energy could stay in the air for days, weeks, even months.  \n\nThe technical term is\"ultra-long endurance autonomous aircraft\". \n\nThe team think it could revolutionise the telecommunications industry. \n\n'Almost expendable'\n\nThe oft-quoted rule of thumb in the space business is that putting a satellite into orbit costs its weight in gold.  \n\nA Phoenix\"pseudosatellite\"could do the same job from high in the atmosphere at a fraction of the cost.  \n\nProf Rae says some aircraft can already do this but are complex and expensive. \n\nPhoenix, by contrast, is so cheap as to be\"almost expendable\".  \n\nIn addition to UHI, the Phoenix project involves Bristol, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southampton universities.  \n\nIt also involved four commercial companies and three of the UK's Technology Catapults, and has been part funded by the UK government's innovation agency Innovate UK. \n\nWinter winds\n\nThe prototype Phoenix has been successfully tested inside the Drystack in Portsmouth, a huge indoor area which normally stores pleasure boats.  \n\nIt was used to shelter the aircraft from the winter winds although production versions would operate in all weathers. \n\nThe project has involved its partners integrating the solar cells, flight control system, micropumps, carbon fibre wings and tail, reversible hydrogen fuel cell and rechargeable battery.  \n\nThe last of these is what enables a solar-powered vehicle to keep working all night.  \n\n Now that the prototype has flown successfully, the consortium wants to collaborate with major manufacturers to take Phoenix to the next level.\nTL;DR: Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) have helped create a revolutionary new type of aircraft.\n\nArticle: By Ben MorrisTechnology of Business editor\n\nAs a former professional athlete - he was with the NFL's New Orleans Saints until 2011 - he knew a lot about nutrition and believed in pea protein, but had trouble convincing others about its benefits.\n\nIn 2013 he was working for his family's business, Puris, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which had just developed its own pea protein.\n\nBut when he tried to sell them, customers were dubious:\"What are you guys doing... protein from peas?

One of them, as everyone now knows, on child sexual abuse.\n\nThe trouble with twinkle-toed Dickens, who enjoyed telling tales of his exploits at tea dances in Leicester Square, that he never seemed to be quite sure of the difference between the trivial and the serious.\n\nAnd he had a gift for farce. The press conference at which he announced that he was going to pull out a skeleton from his own closet (in the form of a glamorous partner from one of the tea dances) turned into a famous Westminster occasion when he asked the reporters summoned to hear his confession - if they could hold back the news for a short time.\n\nUnaware that a number had already left the room to phone their news desk, and Mrs Dickens, he admitted he had wanted a little time because he called the press conference and rattled the skeleton in public without having taken the trouble to tell his wife first.\n\nThe picture of a cheery bumbler was complete. He was much mocked, and much liked, perhaps because there was an evident authenticity in his working class Tory style, despite his habit at Question Time of sounding as if he was auditioning for an end of the pier show (\"Mr Speaker, I want to do a favour for every woman in this country\").\n\nBut when he started to talk about having assembled a dossier that named names and told a story of paedophile networks in high places, was it not surprising that everyone had a tremor of doubt?\n\nWas it more of a performance than a serious investigation? The question was natural, because Geoffrey was Geoffrey.\n\nNow the dossier is back, though the MP who compiled it never seemed to have kept a copy himself, and long years passed after his initial accusations in the early 1980s with little progress on his part. His naming in the Commons of a former diplomat, Sir Peter Hayman, as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) turned out to be an arrow accurately aimed, but of others we heard nothing.\n\nThe reason may have as much to do with the atmosphere of the time as with Dickens himself. There was little of the public concern with paedophilia at the time, almost as if a kind of innocence still attended the subject: many people were simply unwilling to imagine acts that are now discussed openly, and there was no welter of internet comment and campaign on the subject.\n\nIndeed, a sense of disbelief still swirled around the subject. And the trouble was that Dickens, well known as a rent-a-quote MP with a colourful opinion ready to be pulled out of his hat at a moment's notice, was the worst person to dispel it.\n\nHe was no methodical campaigner, pursuing his leads and building his case, but a slash and burn man ready to speak about dark conspiracies (he pointed to burglaries at his home and threats against him after speaking about paedophilia), but without a steady hand on the tiller. In the end, it was Geoffrey and people would shrug their shoulders.\n\nListeners who heard the rebroadcast comments of Tim Fortescue, a former Conservative whip from the Heath-era speaking in a documentary years after, will get the real sense of the times. A chap - it was usually a chap - would come to the whips, and confess his trouble. Sex, money, drink. A brush with the law. You name it. And what happened? They helped out quietly. \n\nThat was the tenor of the time. It was the same in all the whips' offices, and everyone knew it.\n\nNo doubt it still goes on, but I would venture to say that it is less brazen.\n\nAnd whether we will ever see the Dickens dossier, who knows? If we did, I imagine we would find that there were some nuggets in there, but quite a lot of fools' gold too.\n\nHe was probably the wrong man, though he remained a popular figure, especially in the last illness (he died in 1995) which he handled with great courage. And perhaps his dossier died with him.\n\nWhatever we may make of his credentials as a campaigner, that may be a pity.\nTL;DR: The Today programme's James Naughtie, who was a parliamentary lobby correspondent in the 1970s and 80s, remembers Geoffrey Dickens, the colourful Conservative MP whose dossier on an alleged paedophile network is now the focus of a new inquiry.\n\nArticle: Convictions for rape and other sexual offences have risen to new highs of 2,991 and 10,721 respectively, it says. \n\nIn the same time, there was a drop in prosecutions and convictions for domestic abuse.\n\nThe director of public prosecutions said more sex offenders were being prosecuted\"than ever before\".\n\nThe 10th annual report on violence against women and girls showed sex crimes and domestic abuse offences accounted for a fifth of the CPS's caseload in 2016/17.\n\nThis has more than doubled from 7% a decade ago. \n\nAlison Saunders, director of public prosecutions, said special measures such as allowing victims to give evidence from behind a screen or via videolink and a team of independent advisers had made people feel more supported in coming forward. \n\nShe said the majority of violence against women involved domestic abuse. \n\nHowever, the CPS said the fall in domestic abuses cases getting to court - from 100,930 in 2015-16 to 93,590 a year later -  was because the police were referring fewer cases to them.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Breakfast, Ms Saunders said it was difficult to know why.\n\nShe said the CPS was working with police to consider possible factors, including data collection methods, women being prepared to report offences but not wanting to see it through court or the increased use of domestic violence protection orders, which could indicate people want the violence to stop but don't necessarily want to prosecute.\n\nKatie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, said the fall in domestic abuse cases getting to court was\"worrying\".\n\n\"Both the CPS and the police need to do much more to ensure sufficient evidence is collected to prosecute the perpetrator without relying on victim's testimony,\"she said.\n\nBut the report does suggest that a new law, which targets those domestic abusers who control victims via social media or spy on them online but stop short of violence, is being used. \n\nSince it came into force in 2015, there have been 309 offences of controlling or coercive behaviour charged.\n\nMs Saunders said perpetrators were tracking women's mobile phones, and alienating their friends and family.\n\n\"It's quite a difficult case to prosecute but prosecutors have been able to present really strong cases,\"she said.\n\n'Significant strides'\n\nThe report also reveals:\n\nMs Saunders said the CPS had made\"significant strides\"in the last 10 years, adding:\"More offenders are being successfully prosecuted for sexual crimes than ever before, including those committed against children.\"\n\nA Home Office spokesman said the government was committed to tackling violence against women and girls.\n\n\"We recognise we still need to do more, which is why we will be introducing a landmark Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill to protect and support victims and bring perpetrators to justice,\"he added.\n\nThe draft bill, which was in the Queen's Speech in July, will establish a domestic violence and abuse commissioner for England and Wales and make sure sentences for abusive behaviour involving a child reflects the life-long damage caused.\n\nCorrection 24 September 2018: An earlier version of this article included incorrect figures for the number of rape and sexual offences convictions in 2016-17 and has been amended.\nTL;DR: A record number of sex offenders were brought to justice in England and Wales last year, according to a report by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\nArticle: Two years ago Priyanka Chopra showed up to make milkshake at a West Hollywood eatery. \n\nThe milkshake was named Exotic, after her single with rapper Pitbull. Since she does not cook much, she essentially made almond milk, with bananas.  And outside the Millions of Milkshake store, a couple of hundred Bollywood fans - mostly Indian American residents of Los Angeles, showed up.\n\nMaking the milkshake was part of the solid public relations campaign to build brand Chopra in the US - a journey that started in 2012 when she signed up with the Hollywood talent agency CAA and released her first single In My City, which debuted on NFL's Thursday Night Football show.   \n\nWhile Chopra looked hot and was definitely trying the rock star image, many football fans were not thrilled with a singer with foreign looks.  And they were not silent either, calling her everything from an Arab terrorist, to a fake looking Kim Kardashian on social media.\n\n'Amazing response'\n\nPublicly Chopra was calm about the criticism. In an interview with Wall Street Journal television she said:   \n\n\"I've been in the limelight, in a public space, for very long. I understand dealing with brickbats and bouquets\u2026And I've dealt with racism\u2026 I'm called a terrorist, because I happen to be brown and from South Asia, and (have received) hate mail saying'You're not white, why should you be on NFL?' Despite that, I'd rather focus on the millions of other people who've been sending emails or tweets and \u2026saying it's amazing.\"\n\nIt is hard to say if there were millions of other people who actually wrote to her.  Movie stars have a way of overdramatising reality.  But in a couple of weeks millions are going to see Chopra in the new ABC show Quantico.  \n\nIn the new series Chopra plays Alex Parrish, a FBI recruit who is Indian American in the true sense. Her mother is Indian in the show, while her father is Caucasian (hence her name).  Also, a family tragedy takes Parrish to Mumbai for 10 years, which explains why Chopra's character speaks with an educated upper class Indian accent.\n\nBut here is the twist. \n\nChopra is still not a household name in the US. In fact, it is safe to say that despite her music, and even the stunning Guess Jeans campaign that was shot by Bryan Adams in late 2013, most Americans do not know the Bollywood star.  \n\nThat could definitely change if Quantico becomes a big hit. In the season as major networks unveil their new television shows, ABC is really banking on Quantico and posters of Chopra's face are appearing all across America.  In New York City the poster with Chopra's face, as she holds her FBI identity card to her full red lips, is plastered in every subway station, as well as on buses and bus stops. \n\nThere are similar reports from other major American cities - Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. And this past week I saw the same posters all over Toronto as well.\n\nChopra's face is surely captivating and with such a massive marketing campaign the show which starts on 27 September should draw in large audiences for the first few episodes at least. The first episode that ABC has shared with journalists is very gripping with enough twists to ensure that one would want to watch the next segment.\n\nBollywood breakout?\n\nBut the network is taking a big gamble with its marketing campaign. And it is remarkable that this is the first time a Bollywood actor of Chopra's stature has been the subject of such a massive campaign in North America.\n\nRecently Western Union posted ads in some subways stations in New York City showing the face of Shah Rukh Khan.  But there are only little more than three million Indian Americans in the US. And if we add other South Asians to the pool, the number is still not more than five million.  Both Chopra and Khan are really not known outside this small pool. \n\nA quick look at the cast from Quantico indicates that most of the actors have played in indie films or other television shows. But none of the women in the group have been crowned Miss World. And nobody in that cast is as famous as Chopra - given her Bollywood status.  \n\nClearly times are changing and producers and other television executives are opening up to the possibilities of fresh faces that represent the mosaic of ethnicities that define America.  \n\nIt started with African American, Asian and Latino actors. But now many sit-coms on television star one brown South Asian character?\n\nChopra's agents have been hard at work to push her career in the US. But she still has one foot in Bollywood. Later this year she will be seen in Bajirao Mastani and just this week the poster of her 2016 film Jai Gangaajal was released on social media.  \n\nIf Quantico takes off - and hit television shows can continue for years - Chopra will be spending a lot more time in the US. The good news for her is that she will not have to resort to making milkshakes to get press.\n\nAseem Chhabra is a freelance entertainment writer based in New York City. He is also the director of the New York Indian Film Festival\nTL;DR: Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra has been featured in billboards and posters across the US as the starring role in the TV show Quantico. But will the show finally catapult her into the American consciousness?

Tony Armstrong from the charity Living Streets said although there had been big drop in casualties, there was a danger of complacency.\n\n\"The significant reduction in the number of pedestrians

But it is a little more complicated than that.\n\nAfter dodging a question asked a few different ways, the translator finally explained.\n\nAs a woman, she has no say.  It depends on her husband. If her husband decides to stop having children, then she can go to the health centre and stop.\n\n\"But here it all depends on the husband.  The last word is from the husband.\"\n\nSmaller families\n\nAnd so on the other side of town the men are sitting cross-legged under a tree and chatting about similar things - they call it husband school.\n\nHealth, education and talk of the millet harvest is interspersed with chats about breastfeeding and spacing children.\n\nAlthough Musa Malamharu, 47, is leading the conversation, he has two wives and 15 children, and is expecting to have at least two or three more.\n\nIt's part of the same programme - Project Sawki they call it - and the aim is to reduce the number of women dying in childbirth and children dying before the age of five - as well as trying to encourage smaller families.\n\nIf there's more certainty in life people don't need as many children, but it's getting over the\"national characteristic\".\n\nMudaha Musa, 27, seems persuaded that five or six children - two or three more than he has at the moment - are probably sufficient.\n\n\"Truly there is a problem here with having too many children,\"he admitted,\"but with husband school we've begun to see the benefits.\"\n\nEducation appears to be the key to reducing the number of babies born.\n\nAt a mobile clinic well off the main road a small open room is packed full of women and small children.\n\nThe nurses are handing out different contraceptive methods for the crowd to inspect.\n\nThere are condoms, femidoms, pills, inter-uterine devices and even a discussion about birth control implants.\n\nThat's when Nana Aisha, 28, stepped up and said that's what she's agreed - despite fears about the pain and the dangers - to have a three-year implant injected in front of everybody.\n\n\"I'm just going to show to the other ladies, because there are some false rumours that it might be something that can get stuck inside of muscles,\"she said, and it was over in an instant.\n\nSome of the women gathered round to prod and poke at her arm - the implant clearly visible beneath her skin.\n\nShe has three children, but will put off having any more for at least the next three years.\n\n\"My husband is an educated person.  He's actually the one who's encouraging me to go to the health centre for family planning,\"she said.\n\nBut even if many people are persuaded, the dramatic growth of population in Niger will take a long time to slow down. \n\nIts population of 21 million people is predicted to exceed 68 million in the next 30 years.\n\n\"Yes the culture is changing.  Because it's women themselves who understand that having many children is a problem for themselves,\"said midwife Furera Umarou.\n\nShe believes those couples who are persuaded may have four or five children rather than eight or nine - it's a start.\n\nThere's much talk of a\"demographic dividend\"- the ability of a young and active workforce to catapult economies out of poverty as fertility and mortality decline, but that needs investment and jobs for them to fill.\n\n\"If we don't capture the benefits of the demographic dividend, we will be thrown into a total state of disequilibrium,\"said Dr Hassane Atamo, head of the government's family planning division.\n\n\"That could threaten the survival of the country and encourage different things like terrorism and immigration.\"\n\nA vast pool of jobless young people could be set on the migrant trail to Europe, or into the hands of Islamist extremists like Boko Haram. \n\nMassive population growth is everyone's problem.\nTL;DR: Africa's population is expected to double by 2050, but in the country with the highest birth rate in the world it's on track to triple.\n\nArticle: A report presented to the meeting will call for a moratorium on their use while the ethical questions they raise are debated.\n\nThe robots are machines programmed in advance to take out people or targets, which - unlike drones - operate autonomously on the battlefield.\n\nThey are being developed by the US, UK and Israel, but have not yet been used.\n\nSupporters say the\"lethal autonomous robots\", as they are technically known,  could save lives, by reducing the number of soldiers on the battlefield.\n\nBut human rights groups argue they raise serious moral questions about how we wage war, reports the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. \n\nThey include: Who takes the final decision to kill? Can a robot really distinguish between a military target and civilians? \n\nIf there are serious civilian casualties, they ask, who is to be held responsible? After all, a robot cannot be prosecuted for a war crime.\n\n\"The traditional approach is that there is a warrior, and there is a weapon,\"says Christof Heyns, the UN expert examining their use,\"but what we now see is that the weapon becomes the warrior, the weapon takes the decision itself.\"\n\nThe moratorium called for by the UN report is not the complete ban human rights groups want, but it will give time to answer some of those questions, our correspondent says.\nTL;DR: So-called killer robots are due to be discussed at the UN Human Rights Council, meeting in Geneva.\n\nArticle: Lord Lucan vanished from his family home in London in 1974 following the death of family nanny Sandra Rivett. An inquest found he murdered her.\n\nThere has since been speculation and stories about what happened to him. \n\nHis son, George Bingham, told the West End Extra newspaper the application would provide\"closure\". \n\nInternational'sightings' \n\nSandra Rivett, nanny to the 7th Earl of Lucan's three children, was found murdered at the family home at 46 Lower Belgrave Street in central London on 7 November 1974.\n\nLord Lucan's car was found abandoned and soaked in blood in Newhaven, East Sussex. \n\nThe following year an inquest jury found he murdered her. \n\nDespite the fact Lord Lucan was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999, there have been reported sightings of him in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand, and even claims he lived in India as a hippy called\"Jungly Barry\".\n\nMr Bingham, who was a child when his father disappeared, told West End Extra he was applying to the High Court under the Presumption of Death Act, which came into effect a year ago.\n\nHe said the 1999 declaration had not proved death\"for all purposes\"and the new law allowed for a\"more complete process\".\n\nMr Bingham previously applied to take his father's title in 1999 but his application was denied by the Lord Chancellor because he was\"not satisfied\"by his case.\n\nThe Presumption of Death Act was the result of a campaign supported by relatives of high-profile missing people including chef Claudia Lawrence, who disappeared in York in 2009, and Manic Street Preachers guitarist Richey Edwards, who went missing in 1995.\nTL;DR: The son of the peer Lord Lucan, who disappeared almost 41 years ago, has applied to have his father declared \"presumed dead\".\n\nArticle: He was treated in hospital after what Greater Manchester Police (GMP) called an\"incredibly nasty incident\"at about 13:50 BST on Sunday in Whalley Range.\n\nThe officer - who sustained wounds to his face and shoulder - is now recovering at home, the force said.\n\nA 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article and assaulting a police officer.\n\nA witness said the attacker ran towards officers with a 3ft sword held\"up in the air\"before being detained on Upper Chorlton Road.\n\n'Immense bravery'\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said:\"The officers responded with immense bravery to this report and while the sergeant is making a good recovery, this was an incredibly nasty incident which could have been so much worse.\"\n\nHe said the force had received\"an overwhelming number of messages of support and best wishes for the officers involved,\"adding:\"We feel proud protecting and serving the communities of Greater Manchester.\"\n\nPolice said they were responding to reports of an armed man threatening people about half a mile away in Demesne Road.\n\nA number of streets around the scene of the attack were cordoned off while investigations continue.\nTL;DR: A police officer has been slashed with a sword in a Manchester street attack.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News, Vienna\n\nThe radar spacecraft was  \n          \n \n          launched in 2010\n to monitor changes in the thickness and shape of polar ice.\n        \n\nScientists have spent the past two years getting to grips with its data.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, they reported that  \n          \n \n          Cryosat\n was now delivering an unprecedented view of the seasonal growth and retreat of sea ice spanning the entire Arctic basin.\n        \n\nThe researchers also released a map showing the difference in height across the Greenland ice sheet.\n\nClick the two tabs above to see visualisations of the satellite's data.\n\n\"The message is that Cryosat is working extremely well. Its data are very reliable and the measurements we have match reality,\"said Prof Volker Liebig, the director of Earth Observation at the European Space Agency (Esa).\n\n\"We now have a very powerful tool to monitor the changes taking place at the poles,\"he told BBC News.\n\nThe Esa director delivered an update on the mission at London's Royal Society. The information was also being released here at the  \n          \n \n          European Geosciences Union (EGU)\n meeting in Vienna, Austria. \n        \n\nSeveral satellites have already detailed the  \n          \n \n          recent and rapid erosion of summer sea ice extent\n as the Arctic has warmed.\n        \n\nBut Cryosat's innovation has been to provide a means to get at a figure for ice volume - a far more significant number in terms of understanding the long-term viability of the ice.\n\nTo do this, the satellite carries one of the highest resolution synthetic aperture radars ever put in orbit.\n\nThe instrument sends down pulses of microwave energy which bounce off both the top of the ice and the water in the cracks, or leads, which separate the floes.\n\nBy measuring the difference in height between these two surfaces, scientists can, using a relatively simple calculation, work out the overall volume of the marine cover.\n\nThe Cryosat team, led from University College London, has spent the period since launch working through the satellite's measurements, validating and calibrating them against a number of independent observations.\n\nThese include data from plane-borne instruments, from direct on-the-ice assessments, and even from scientific sea-floor moorings that profile the ice floes as they pass overhead.   \n\n\"We can now say with good confidence that Cryosat's maps of ice thickness are correct to within 10-20cm,\"said Dr Seymour Laxon, from  \n          \n \n          UCL's Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM)\n.\n        \n\nTuesday's release shows a complete seasonal cycle, from October 2010, when the Arctic Ocean was beginning to freeze up following the summer melt, right through to March 2011, when the sea ice was approaching peak thickness. Cryosat found the volume (area multiplied by thickness) of sea ice in the central Arctic in March 2011 to have been 14,500 cubic kilometres.\n\nThis figure is very similar to that suggested by  \n          \n \n          PIOMAS (Panarctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System)\n, an influential computer model that has been used to estimate Arctic sea ice volume, and which has been the basis for several predictions about when summer sea ice in the north might disappear completely.\n        \n\nIn addition to the announcement on sea ice, the Cryosat team also published a digital elevation model (DEM) of Greenland.\n\nThe big island, too, has experienced some rapid changes of late and is losing tens of billions of tonnes of its ice cover to the ocean annually.\n\nThe DEM is a map of varying height, and the visualisation on this page incorporates a year's worth of data.\n\nFor Cryosat, it is another illustration of its capability. Radar satellites have traditionally struggled to discern the detail in the steep slopes and ridges that mark the edges of ice sheets, but the Esa spacecraft can recover far more information thanks to a special interferometric observing mode that uses two antennas.\n\n\"This is really the first demonstration of the interferometer in action,\"said  \n          \n \n          Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University\n.\n        \n\n\"The DEM contains about 7.5 million data points, and we're pretty confident this will be the best elevation model for Greenland, by some margin. Our next step is to compare it to previous data to see how Greenland has changed.\"\n\nCryosat's principal investigator, Prof Duncan Wingham - formerly of UCL but now chief executive of the UK's National Environment Research Council - summed up:\"We have years of data to come, but I think it's quite clear that we will provide synoptic, accurate, Arctic-wide thickness; and that we will be able to determine the accuracy of the predictions of when the Arctic will be ice-free in Summer.  \n\n\"And I think it's also clear we can now sustain coverage of [ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland] right down to the coast.\"\n\nThe Cryosat update was timed to coincide with this week's  \n          \n \n          50th anniversary of UK activity in orbit\n.   \n        \n\nApril 1962 was the month Britain became a space-faring nation with the launch of its first satellite, Ariel-1.  \n\nAs part of the celebration, current capabilities and missions with strong UK interest  \n          \n \n          are being highlighted\n.\n        \n\nCryosat's map of Arctic sea ice thickness - April 2011\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on  \n          \n \n          Twitter\nTL;DR:  Europe's Cryosat mission is now watching the ebb and flow of Arctic sea ice with high precision. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter\n\nWhat is Opposition?\n\nThe term Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition started as a joke in the early 19th century House of Commons, but it stuck. \n\nIn modern times, the party with the second highest number of MPs is the official opposition - it is their constitutional duty to be an alternative government. \n\nThe leader of the opposition is seen as a prime-minister-in-waiting and gets a bigger salary, a much bigger office and has to attend official events. \n\nMr Corbyn - a staunch anti-Monarchist - is going to be seeing a fair bit of the Queen. \n\nHe has joined the Privy Council, the inner circle of advisers to Her Majesty, prompting cries of hypocrisy from his friends in the press.\n\nThe worst job in politics\n\nNot for nothing is Leader of the Opposition known as the most difficult job at Westminster - all responsibility and no power. \n\nTaking on the government with a fraction of its resources and trying to get a fair hearing - or any hearing - for your policies can be a frustrating, soul-destroying experience. \n\nInfamy, infamy!\n\nYou also have to watch your back. \n\nThere are always potential assassins lurking in the shadows - or in Mr Corbyn's case writing opinion pieces for national newspapers. \n\nWilliam Hague, a man who learnt a thing or two about treachery during his time as Conservative leader, had this advice for Mr Corbyn in his Telegraph column:\"The new leader cannot afford for long the threat of open discontent or rebellion. He has to keep an eye on every MP who is aggrieved or demoralised while managing three concentric rings of potential enemies.\"\n\nWhat's the secret?\n\nGordon Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride (pictured) says effective opposition comes down to organisation - and Mr Corbyn risks letting down his army of supporters if he is not able to use the full resources at his disposal to attack David Cameron. \n\n\"They elected Jeremy Corbyn as someone who is really going to go at the government and be different and take them on. He will need ammunition from the public but also the ammunition he gets from his own MPs,\"he tells BBC News. \n\nAttacks on the government have to be carefully-targeted and co-ordinated - and questions have to be watertight. It is no good launching a full frontal assault on David Cameron if it falls apart at the first challenge to some dodgy statistics. \n\n\"He needs a research operation and that is always something that is coordinated by ministerial offices and the whips office,\"says Mr McBride.\n\nHow is Corbyn handling it so far?\n\nHe steadied the ship with his first Prime Minister's Questions but it has been a bumpy start, with Mr Corbyn's own views on fundamental issues such as Europe, benefits and nuclear weapons sometimes appearing at odds with those of his own front bench.  \n\nAs a backbench MP, Mr Corbyn could make up his own policies. Not any more. \n\n\"He has never had to compromise. But now he is leading a team and you do have to make compromises. It is different to being a backbencher. It is a big challenge,\"says Ayesha Hazarika, Harriet Harman's former chief of staff. \n\nGetting a grip\n\nThursday's appointment of Neale Coleman as Mr Corbyn's head of policy and rebuttal, is being seen as major boost to his chances of running a strong opposition. \n\nMr Coleman is a former adviser to Ken Livingstone, when he was London mayor, and was closely involved in the bid for the London Olympics, and the subsequent staging of the games. \n\nHe joins another former Livingstone adviser, Simon Fletcher, who is Mr Corbyn's campaign director. \n\nEven Tory-supporting lobbyist Peter Bingle, not a fan of Mr Corbyn, is impressed, calling Mr Coleman\"one of the best advisers I have ever worked with\". \n\nThe combination of Mr Coleman and Mr Fletcher means the Labour leader has\"appointed two of the best political brains,\"he adds. \n\nDiscipline issues\n\nOne of Corbyn's first decisions was to keep Rosie Winterton on as Labour's chief whip - seen as another shrewd move. \n\nAs a serial rebel Mr Corbyn will know all about her powers of persuasion, even if he was able to resist them. \n\nDeputy leader Tom Watson will also play a crucial role. \n\nHe hates being called a\"fixer\"apparently but, as a former minister and head of Labour campaigns, and the man who played a role in toppling Tony Blair, he knows how to get things done at Westminster.  \n\nMoney worries\n\nMr Corbyn can rely on money from the trade unions - he raised \u00a3220,000 from them during his leadership campaign. \n\nBut wealthy individuals who have previously donated large sums to Labour have been lining up to pull the plug.  \n\nOne of them, Assem Allam, the controversial owner of Hull City football club, has even offered to bankroll any\"moderate\"Labour MPs who want to break away and form their own party, according to The Times. \n\nHome shopping tycoon John Mills, Labour's biggest individual donor in recent years, has also offered to funnel money into Labour MPs intent on keeping the moderate flame alight, according to The Telegraph.\n\nIt is hard to see abstemious Mr Corbyn squeezing into a smart suit to schmooze City big wigs over brandy and cigars. \n\nBut converting some of the 88,449 people who signed up to vote for him for \u00a33 into full members, at \u00a346.50 a pop, might help ease the party's money worries.\n\nTaming the media beast\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told Channel 4 News Team Corbyn did not need mainstream media - it had its own media, by which he meant social media, the secret weapon that propelled Mr Corbyn to the party leadership. \n\nIt must indeed be tempting for Team Corbyn to stick two fingers up to the tabloids, figuring they will never get a fair hearing (Ed Miliband tried to tame the beast - even posing with a copy of The Sun - and look where it got him, they might argue). \n\nBut that is dangerous thinking, says prominent Corbyn supporter Owen Jones, in The Guardian:\"If social media were as politically invaluable as the left would like, Labour would now be in office with a majority of 150,\"he writes. \n\nMost people are not on Twitter and the vast majority of those that do use the site are not interested in politics, getting what information they need from newspapers and TV news bulletins.\n\nSend for a spin doctor\n\nSo how exactly do you get a hearing in the mainstream media, if large swathes of it are hostile to you?\n\nThe conventional answer has been to hire a Fleet Street hard man or woman as your press chief. \n\nDamian McBride does not think it is necessary for Mr Corbyn to have an\"Alastair Campbell-style Svengali\"- but he warns Team Corbyn against thinking they can just carry on where they left off with the leadership campaign, by holding more public meetings and extending their social media presence. \n\n\"They may, if they are sensible, rely on regional media, where they may think they will get a fairer hearing, but that can't ever be enough. \n\n\"I think they are going to have to accept some of the advice they are getting to at the very least engage with the broadcasters, who will tend to always be more balanced, and to just try and reach out through some of the national newspapers.\"\n\nIf Labour's attacks on the government are eye-catching enough The Sun and The Daily Mail will print them, he argues.\n\nIt's early days\n\nMedia\"tittle tattle\"is how Jeremy Corbyn has dismissed the stories - such as the row over his decision not to sing the national anthem - that have swirled around him since he took over. \n\nHe is trying to do things differently, he insists. \n\nThat is no excuse for\"chaotic\"media management, sloppy briefings and pulling out of interviews, mutter the Westminster media classes. \n\nHas his refusal to play the media game put a few noses out of joint? \n\n\"I think there is a little bit of that,\"says Ayesha Hazarika. \n\n\"If you are in Team Corbyn your primary concern is probably not how the media feel they have been treated. We are in a different politics now. \n\n\"These things were much higher up the agenda before. We are in a completely new situation in Labour politics. There has been a cultural revolution.\"\nTL;DR: Jeremy Corbyn created a grassroots movement that swept him to the Labour leadership against the odds. But now he has to run Britain's main opposition party - a very different challenge. How will he cope? \n\n\n\nArticle: By Ciara ColhounBBC News NI\n\nWhen she was was born - near the Irish border in County Fermanagh in 1942 - it was not unusual for families to live without electricity and running water.\n\nMargaret's neighbours only began to update their homes in the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBut her family missed the opportunity to join the trend due to her mother's death, when Margaret was 10, and her father's ill health.\n\nNow aged 77, she is one of few elderly people in the UK and Ireland who have lived their entire lives off-grid.\n\n\"I am doing it because I like doing it, not because I'm a hippy, that I think it's new and fashionable,\"she said.\n\n\"My childhood was over at 10. My father took to the bed with severe arthritis, so it never was feasible for us to do anything.\n\n'There were no finances'\n\n\"I didn't have the will, he didn't have the will to do it and there were no finances if we were very keen to do it so it just didn't come onto the radar.\"\n\nMargaret has lived alone in the family's 18th century thatched cottage since her father's death in 1980.\n\nLiving without modern amenities requires physical strength - she must cross a field to collect water in a bucket from a well up to 10 times a day and needs to stoop to cook over an open fire, which she lights every morning from a stack of turf and logs.\n\nHer daily routine begins at 05:30 BST when she heats water in a kettle over the fire for washing and tea - milk and perishables are stored in a wheelie bin. She keeps up-to-date with news on a wind-up radio.\n\nLamps decorate the thick stone windowsills of her tiny two-bedroom home, but paraffin is expensive so Margaret's schedule is governed by daylight - she is usually in bed by 18:30 BST.\n\n'People are entitled to live as they want'\n\nMargaret said her lifestyle meant she grew up with\"the seasons being the master of us all.\"\n\nShe recalled her father taking her outside as a child on Halloween night to gauge the wind direction.\n\nThe prevailing wind would, according to local lore, determine the severity of the winter ahead.\n\nShe loves summer and is less keen on winter when she uses a long fishing pole to push snow off her roof to prevent damage to the thatch.\n\nDespite the difficulties of a cold winter in a house without central heating, Margaret said the compensations of her life could not be overstated.\n\n\"You have the birds in the morning nesting in the house, you have the views, the tranquillity and peace, you have the clock ticking - all those things that you couldn't put a price on,\"she said.\n\n\"I am living the way my forefathers lived, who left the footprint for me. It was good enough for my people, for my parents, my grandparents, who bought the house in 1887 - it is a tribute to them.\"\n\n'I am not going to change for anyone'\n\nMargaret said visitors were often surprised that she does not fit the stereotype of an elderly woman living off-grid.\n\nThey expect to find her, she said,\"sitting in the corner wearing a long black dress and a white apron.\"\n\nInstead, if they take a peek in her bedroom, they will find this sprightly woman likes modern fashion - evident from her long ear rings and the red high-heeled shoes stored beside her bed, bought for the time she received an MBE for community work from the Prince of Wales.\n\n\"I don't know of anyone living like me, without electricity, without running water without any of the amenities. But then I am not interested in how people live. People are entitled to live as they want,\"she said.\n\n\"I am my own person, I have my own identity, this house embodies who I am and what I am.

Alongside the more traditional sights rooted in the nativity and fairytales are the more unusual themes of sparkly sprouts, llamas and naughty polar bears.\n\nBut the road to success starts not on 1 December, but far, far earlier.\n\nMark Neilly, senior creative project manager at Hello Flamingo, which specialises in window display design for firms like Habitat and Selfridges, said UK retailers start planning in January.\n\n\"Christmas window and in-store schemes are normally the biggest projects of the year for brands and retailers, and it is where most visual merchandising and marketing budgets are allocated to,\"he explains.\n\nRetailers often take a cue from the\"world class and innovate\"displays showcased in New York City, drawing inspiration from the exteriors of stores like Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nAt the Fenwick department store in Newcastle, they are already\"well on the way with themes and creative concepts for 2019\", says its head of creative, Paul Baptiste.\n\n\"Theatre and storytelling [is] at the heart of what we do,\"he says.\n\n\"The window displays create memories for generations of our communities and they will always have an important place in each of our stores.\"\n\nThis year, scenes from Raymond Briggs's classic, The Snowman, fill the window. \n\nIt is a celebration of the story's 40th anniversary and features some of the film's most well-known moments, including the ice-skating snowmen and the flight around the globe.\n\nDrawing on fairytales and well-known stories is a tried and tested route, but every year brings with it the desire to come up with something fresh.\n\nEven with 160 years of Christmas display experience behind them, Harrods in London tries to do something different with their 27 windows.\n\n\"Every year we face the challenge of reinventing the magic of Christmas in a fun, imaginative way while staying true to the traditions of the season,\"says the shop's creative visual director, Alex Wells-Greco.\n\n\"A big part of our inspiration has been the idea of festive feasting, something we also celebrated in a 1950s window display, which featured a giant Christmas cake, and a number of miniature chefs.\n\n\"[This year] we've even erected an 8ft Christmas tree on Hans Crescent, covered in sparkling Brussels sprouts and embellished lobsters, and topped with a glitzy champagne bottle.\"\n\nOthers favour a more immersive approach.\n\nAt Castle Gardens in Sherborne, Dorset, the display features music and smells, and is all about\"tantalising the senses\", says director Louise Burks.\n\nThis year's display features a\"unicorn dreamland\", a 1980s-themed section, llamas, pom-poms and Frida Kahlo embroidered cushions.\n\nIzzy Pilcher painstaking hung slinky spring toys and suspending Rubik's Cubes from the ceiling, as well as making a wall of shiny tinsel.\n\n\"It's a tactile area and we want visitors to touch everything, really be absorbed in it,\"she says.\n\n\"But it's a weekly job just to re-hang and untangle them.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nFancy advent calendars - rip-off or festive fun?\n\nMulled wine... in a slow cooker- - BBC News\n\n'Saving Christmas' for lonely cats - BBC News\n\nStraying from the traditional is increasingly common practice and Castle Gardens, for example, has featured Strictly Come Dancing, Great British Bake Off and I'm a Celebrity in its previous displays. \n\nBut retailers are also focusing more on the idea of gifting, says Mr Neilly, promoting the season's\"must-haves\"which can handily be bought in store.\n\nHowever, this backfired in Nottingham when feminists branded a Marks and Spencer display suggesting women need\"fancy little knickers\"as\"vomit-inducing\". \n\nThe shop's apparent display faux pas was not the only one to make headlines. \n\nA pair of stuffed polar bears re-arranged in a compromising position also shocked shoppers on the Isle of Man, giving - as one person quipped 0\"new meaning to riding the Polar Express\".\n\nMeanwhile, on Oxford Street in London, a major retailer scrapped using fake snow after the store ended up resembling a\"foam party\", says Mr Neilly.\n\n\"[It] had to be mopped out by store staff on an hourly basis.\"\n\nThe windows of Christmas past\n\nWith increasing pressure to improve on last year's display - and competition to attract shoppers to the High Street tougher than ever - perhaps it is to be expected that experimentation might occasionally lead to unintended results.\n\nSo how can success be guaranteed? Lighting, for one, is key to a display, according to Mr Neilly. \n\n\"The use of neon and faux neon has been on the rise, as it can be extremely adaptable to traditional and also very modern schemes,\"he adds.\n\nIt has certainly worked for Harrods, whose 12,000 exterior light bulbs added as a decoration in 1959 became so popular that they made them a permanent fixture.\n\n\"I think lots of stores try to totally modernise and rewrite Christmas, and it doesn't need to be rewritten,\"advises Mr Wells-Greco.\n\n\"Christmas is Christmas - you just need to make it relatable to everyone.\"\nTL;DR: You may still be wrapping this year's Christmas presents but window dressers throughout the land are already planning their festive displays for December 2019. Just how do they create these often impressive spectacles and how do they hook in the shoppers?\n\nArticle: The Labour leader told the BBC the matter was\"far from closed\"but stopped short of calling for the minister's resignation.\n\nMr Jenrick is under fire after granting permission for a luxury housing development to donor Richard Desmond.\n\nDowning Street said the PM had full confidence in the minister.\n\nMr Jenrick says he was motivated by a desire to see more homes built when he overruled government inspectors to give the green light to Mr Desmond's plans for a 1,500 home development at the former Westferry printing works, in London's Isle of Dogs.\n\nTwelve days after the decision Mr Desmond, the former owner of the Daily Express, gave \u00a312,000 to the Conservative Party. Mr Jenrick said he had no knowledge of the donation and had acted on the\"merits\"of the case throughout.\n\nOn Wednesday, Downing Street said Boris Johnson now considered the matter\"closed\"after Mr Jenrick published details of his contacts with Mr Desmond. \n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: \"We want straight answers on this, and I think the public do, they can tell that something's wrong here.\"\n\nHe added there were\"discrepancies\"between the documents published by Mr Jenrick and the account of events he gave to MPs on Wednesday. \n\nHe said the matter was now at the stage\"where the prime minister's judgement is an issue\". \n\nHe renewed calls for the UK's top civil servant Sir Mark Sedwill - who has said he is satisfied with Mr Jenrick's account of events - to investigate whether he broke the guidelines for ministerial conduct.\n\nOn Thursday the PM's spokesman said No 10 had had\"no involvement\"in Mr Jenrick's decision to green-light the scheme. \n\nLabour has written to Mr Jenrick demanding he publish additional documents beyond those he released on Wednesday. \n\nMr Jenrick had said he would use the Freedom of Information Act as a\"benchmark\"to release\"all \u200brelevant information\"about the planning application. \n\nIn a letter, Labour's shadow communities secretary Steve Reed called for him to publish documents beyond the scope of the Act\"in the interests of transparency\".\n\nA billionaire with a planning problem finds himself sitting next to the cabinet minister responsible for planning, at a Conservative fundraising dinner.\n\nThe two later exchange texts and planning permission is granted in the nick of time, just before the developer would have found himself on the hook for a whopping tax bill. \n\nThe billionaire then makes a donation - albeit a small one - to the Conservative Party.\n\nLittle wonder this has caused Labour and others to ask loads of questions about what on earth was going on.\n\nIt looks bad.  That's not my judgement - but that of Robert Jenrick.\n\nMr Jenrick changed his mind and rescinded the planning permission, as it was\"unlawful by reason of apparent bias\".\n\nNote the word\"apparent.\"\n\nThe minister insists he wasn't biased, he declined to visit the proposed building site, and he has always been committed to and driven by ensuring more houses are built.\n\nOh, and there is still no permission for the building work to start.\n\nNotably, Labour is not calling for Robert Jenrick to resign and the prime minister says the case is closed.\n\nSo, for now at least, Mr Jenrick appears safe.\n\nMr Desmond had been lobbying for the proposed 1,500-home development to be approved before the local council, Tower Hamlets, introduced a new Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to pay for local services.\n\nIn a text message to Mr Jenrick in November 2019, with an apparent reference to the Labour council, Mr Desmond wrote:\"...we appreciate the speed as we don't want to give Marxists a load of doe [sic] for nothing!\"\n\nIn one of the papers, a civil servant wrote,\"On timing, my understanding is that the SoS is/was insistent that the decision issued this week i.e. tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the change in London CIL.\"\n\nMr Jenrick approved the scheme on 14 January, by which Mr Desmond avoided paying \u00a340 million for the levy.\n\nBusiness Minister Nahim Zahawi said Mr Jenrick had been motivated by a\"getting stuff built\". \n\n\"But when there was a perception of bias, he pulled back on this, pulled the plug on it and will now allow a different minister to decide the scheme. The access didn't buy this billionaire a decision.\"\n\n'Local services'\n\nJohn Biggs, Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets said:''The revelations about the Westferry printworks decision have blown apart confidence in our planning system under Mr Jenrick.\n\n\"The documents he was forced to release are damning and it looks like he rushed through the decision to help save the developer money and short-change my residents.\n\n''The Minister referred to our borough as'rotten', and messages from the developer called our council'Marxist'. \n\n\"This name calling says more about them and their disregard for my residents whose borough it is, and who rightly want much needed affordable homes and money for local services.''\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday before the documents were released, Mr Jenrick said the accusations were\"not simply wrong but actually outrageous\", adding the decision had been made on its merits after a thorough process.\n\nBut he admitted\"things could and should have been done differently\", saying:\"On reflection, I should have handled the communication differently.\"\nTL;DR: Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick still has questions to answer over his role in a

way\".\n\nThe earliest evidence for cider and perry in Herefordshire dates back to the 15th Century, organisers of Ciderlands said, but production in the region really took off when Bulmers began production there in the late 1800s.\n\nOrganiser and ciderologist, Gabe Cook, said the festival will\"showcase the history of cider making in Hereford\"and also the importance of orcharding in the

So for us as a growing company we want to see transport across the North improved so we can attract and retain the best talent.\"\n\nThe Northern Powerhouse was a concept created by former chancellor George Osborne in 2014 as an attempt to\"rebalance\"the UK's economy away from being dominated by London and the South East. \n\n\"We do in the North East feel at times the government naturally focuses on Manchester and Liverpool so we do have to elbow our way into contention,\"said Dave Budd, the elected mayor of Middlesbrough.\n\n\"I hope the government's Autumn Statement reaffirms the idea of the Northern Powerhouse and that ministers realise that devolution for us is not just a paper exercise.\"\n\nThe regional figures on infrastructure spending are compiled from the government's National Infrastructure Delivery Plan. \n\nThe BBC's analysis has looked at projects specifically identified for each region and has excluded national projects such as HS2 rail as its potential benefits cannot be attributed to any one part of the country.\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said:\"These findings are completely misleading and are not a fair reflection of the level of investment we are making on roads, transport, and housing.\n\n\"In reality, over half of the projects in our pipeline are long-term and benefit more than one region, such as HS2 which is our bold vision for connecting up the great cities of the North.\"\nTL;DR: Yorkshire and the North East are being \"left behind\" their Northern Powerhouse neighbours in the race to fund major projects, council leaders have warned.\n\nArticle: Dr Youssef Beaini, from Bradford, said he had wanted to help fellow healthcare workers concerned about their health.\n\nHe was speaking after an article by the Guardian highlighted he was selling the tests.\n\nThe General Medical Council (GMC) said it expected doctors to be clear about the safety and accuracy of such tests.\n\nDr Beaini said he had acted with friends due to the concerns of himself and many colleagues.\n\n\"For the first time in our lives, through our work, we are looking at really up close the possibility of getting ill from the work,\"he said.\n\n\"Ending up in hospital, possibly even on a ventilator and dying.\"\n\nHe said the scheme was intended to help health professionals.\n\n\"The whole point was to make a positive impact on our society, in fact the project has turned out to have cost me about \u00a31,000.\n\n\"Profit was never an aim of this project whatsoever.\"\n\nThe testing kits use a small amount of blood to reveal if a person has Covid-19, Dr Beaini said.\n\nPublic Health England has said there were no testing kits for coronavirus approved for home use.\n\nDr Beaini said he and his friends purchased about 100 kits and sold about 40, the rest being donated to health professionals and key workers.\n\nAn administrative error meant two kits were sold to members of the public and they have since been refunded, he added.\n\nIn a statement, a GMC spokesperson said:\"We would be concerned to learn that doctors are exploiting patients' vulnerability or lack of medical knowledge, in order to profit from the fear and uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\n\n\"We also expect doctors to be clear about the safety and accuracy of Covid-19 tests, and not to offer or recommend tests that are unproven, clinically unverified and or otherwise unreliable.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

A few months ago, they had their second child - another son.\n\nStuart's recently-written advice booklets for the National Childbirth Trust aim to help other new fathers adjust to their role. \n\nBut despite his experience, Stuart says it is still a shock to be thrown back into caring for a newborn baby. \n\n\"You tend to forget just how hard it is. I presumed that as a second-time dad it would be a walk in the park. \n\n\"The biggest surprises were the obvious things - the lack of sleep and the sheer exhaustion, plus all the crying.\n\n\"If you have a crying baby you go through all of the obvious things on your mental checklist. Are they hungry? Is their nappy wet? Is it wind?\n\n\"But sometimes nothing works and that's the particularly tough bit about it. A lot of parents struggle with that.\"\n\nBut, he says, for men it's the emotional side of things that's hardest. \n\n\"Procedural things like changing a nappy or making a meal are easy to understand. But saying the right thing is trickier.\"\n\nEmotional rollercoaster\n\nStuart describes a mixture of guilt and relief about returning to work and leaving his wife at home to look after the children. \n\n\"You feel torn about leaving. You know you need the money and have to go to work and, if you are honest, you are glad to step away from the chaos for a bit. \n\n\"But you have a guilty sense of escape. And you know that as soon as you come home you will be straight back into it - your second job.\n\n\"You don't want to make too much of the'poor daddy' bit to your partner. She's the one doing the bulk of the work. But you are exhausted.\"\n\nHe says the first time round he tried to do everything by the book to be a supportive husband and hands-on dad.\n\n\"With our first son, Jamie, I felt I had to do more of my share in the night. My wife was breastfeeding so I would get her a glass of water and change his nappy if he needed it. \n\n\"But mostly I would lie awake trying to be silently supportive, yet the best thing I could have done would have been to get my head down and get some sleep.\n\n\"There will be plenty of other times when you can help and there is no sense in both of you being tired.\"\n\nDr Ian Banks, who is a father of four and president of the Men's Health Forum, agrees with this advice. \n\n\"It is worth doing it like a rota and taking it in turns so that you both get a break from time to time.\n\n\"The sleep deprivation you get with a newborn takes its toll. It affects your work, your relationship and your driving, which is worth remembering.\"\n\nDr Banks says his own motto is\"when all else fails, read the instructions\".\n\nHe's written a baby manual for new dads in the same style as the Haynes series of car repair manuals. \n\nAs well as giving practical tips and step-by-step instructions, including how to change a nappy, the book also touches on the emotional side, explaining how to spot post-natal depression in yourself or your partner.  \n\n\"Men like to be in control, but when they have a baby it's hard to be. If they can feel prepared, that helps. That's what the manual's for.\"\nTL;DR: Like Prime Minister David Cameron, Stuart Derrick at 43 years of age is not a novice when it comes to looking after children.  \n\n\n\nArticle: Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent\n\nWildlife officials say they aren't sure, but have in any case bought bottles of Obsession for Men by Calvin Klein to lure a six-year-old tigress that is believed to have killed 13 people around the town of Pandharkawada. She has been evading capture for more than two years.\n\n\"We have been told the cologne can work as a good scent bait for the tigress. So we will spray the perfume on the trees and ground and see what happens,\"Sunil Limaye, a wildlife official, says.\n\nThe fragrance contains a pheromone called civetone derived from the scent glands of a cat-like mammal called the civet, which is often used in cologne. During an experiment at New York's Bronx Zoo, jaguars apparently loved the perfume.\n\nBiologist Miguel Ordenana told the Scientific American magazine that he believed jaguars could be lured to a camera trap by spraying the perfume on a tree branch. Three years ago, the perfume - sprayed on camera traps and cages - was used to trap a leopard in southern Karnataka state.\n\nUsing an expensive perfume to lure a tiger hints at the acute desperation that is building up to capture the big cat, simply named T-1, in what has become one of India's biggest tiger hunts ever. \n\nThe search has frustrated forestry officials and sharpshooters as the tigress - along with her two nine-month-old cubs - continues to skulk in a vast 150 sq km (57 sq miles) area covering jungles, farms and villages. \n\nFear has gripped more than 5,000 people living in 20 villages in the area after three killings in August. To avoid tiger attacks, farmers and graziers are being told to return early from the fields and forest, venture out only in groups, and not defecate in the open fields, a common practice in the villages. \n\nAnimal activists in cities have begun a social media and online campaign to\"save\"the tigress from the hunter's gun, saying that forestry officials don't have the expertise to capture the cat alive and will end up shooting it.\n\nBut, in September, India's Supreme Court waded in, saying it would not interfere if the forest rangers were forced to shoot the tiger while trying to capture it. \n\n\"We do not intend to kill her. But it will all depend on the circumstances. If she attacks us, we'll have to shoot. It's a game of wait and watch,\"AK Mishra, the senior-most wildlife official in the region, says.\n\nThe\"game\"has gone on for too long, say officials, and they have done nearly everything possible to track down the tigress. \n\nThirty-six forest guards go into the forest every day to check more than 100 camera traps that have so far turned up more than 300 images of T-1 and her cubs. At a dozen places in the jungle, horses and goats have been tied to trees as bait. Two horses have been already killed - presumably by the tigress - in October but a search of the areas proved to be futile.\n\nRangers with torches and wireless sets keep watch from four treetop platforms round the clock. Fifty commandos of a\"tiger protection force\", along with policemen armed with AK-47s. patrol the forests. \n\nThey look for fresh pugmarks, sniff out tiger urine, and identify claw marks on tree barks, where tigers polish their retractable claws. A hired sharpshooter has also been moving around separately with his nine-member team. Elephants have also been deployed. A drone and a power glider are flying over the jungle to try to spot the cat.\n\nAt the rag-tag makeshift camp in Sitara village on the edge of the forest, three cages and nylon nets are ready to be transported to any area to capture and bring back the cats. \n\nA group of vets are on hand with tranquiliser darts. In all, 500 men and an array of machines have been pressed into service. And yet, T-1 continues to evade capture.\n\n\"She is very clever. She is with her cubs, so she is extra careful. She manages to outwit us,\"says KM Abharna, a senior forestry official who is co-ordinating the hunt. \n\n\"The terrain doesn't make the job any easier for us.\"\n\nThe teak forest is undulating and rocky. The biggest obstacle is a fast-growing wild shrub called lantana that sometimes grows to heights of 8-10ft. This wild bush makes it difficult for the team to navigate by foot or by vehicle and comes in the way of spotting animals. Panthers, blue bulls, wild pigs and snakes populate the jungle. During the sticky summers, temperatures soar to 48C (118F) and quickly exhaust the hunters. \n\nThe hunt has also brought tragedy in its wake. Earlier this month, five elephants were brought in to carry sharpshooters to spot, cordon off and capture the tigress. The operation ended abruptly when one of the elephants broke away from her shackles, and trampled a village woman to death. The pachyderms were quickly sent back amid villager outrage.\n\n\"The search goes on. We have to be patient,\"says Mr Limaye. \n\nThere are other questions to which answers remain unclear.\n\nFor one, it is not clear where T-1 came from, apart from the fact that she was not born in a protected reserve.  They also know that her mother was electrocuted when she came into contact with a crude electric fence. Farmers often set these up around their land to keep away marauding animals.\n\nWith more than 2,200 big cats, India is home to 60% of the world's tigers. There are more than 200 in Maharashtra, but only a third of them live in the state's 60 protected areas, including sanctuaries, natural parks and tiger reserves. \n\nAnd there is still some confusion about whether T-1 deserves the\"man-eater\"label.  \n\nShe is believed to have killed 10 people in 20 months since 2016. Things came to a head in August when she allegedly killed three people, sparking panic in the area. DNA tests on swabs from tiger saliva from the wounds of seven of the 13 victims so far show that five of them were inflicted by a female tiger. The two other samples turned up inconclusive results. \n\nMany of the bodies were decapitated as she dragged her prey away. She appears to have tasted human flesh: at least one victim was found with his leg torn off. \n\nAlso, it is not clear why T-1 has attacked humans. \n\nRapid deforestation has resulted in tigers often coming into conflict with villagers who live close to their reserves. \n\nBut one of the reasons why T-1 is allegedly attacking humans is the abnormally high numbers of cattle being taken to graze in the forests. \n\nVillagers in the area are holding on to an estimated 30,000 cattle, most of them old and unproductive animals that herders cannot kill because of a government ban on cow slaughter. Villagers are forced to graze them in the forest as there is little fodder at home. Many of the attacks appear to be chance encounters gone wrong, or simply because the humans got in the way of their real prey - the cattle.  \n\n'Blood sucking tiger'\n\nIn January, Ramji Shendre, 70, and his wife went to the jungle with their two cattle. As Shendre lit a fire from the wood he had collected to ward off insects, the tigress suddenly appeared behind him. Some 50 metres away, his wife Lata watched in horror as the tiger dragged her husband's body away. She climbed a rickety platform and screamed for help.\n\nVillagers rushed to the area, vehicles were stopped on a neighbouring road and air-horns were blown. The tiger dragged the body for 2km and abandoned it. \n\n\"She doesn't eat her victims, it seems,\"Lata says.\"She just sucks the blood out of her human prey\". Most villagers call her the\"blood sucking tiger\". But officials say she has eaten the flesh of many of her victims.\n\nAnd yet the hunters nearly got her on 21, May.\n\nThe search group had spotted her 18km away from the camp at Sarati, feasting on a blue bull. They surrounded her, says Ms Abharna, and shot her with a tranquiliser dart.\n\nThe dart struck her.\n\nBut she turned around, swam across a narrow dam, bolted across farms, crossed a macadam road, and disappeared into the forest. Officials say she may have been in a state of heightened excitement which would have made the tranquiliser ineffective.

Should I be worried about the dimpled skin there? What exactly am I feeling for?\n\nThose were the concerns of Corrine Beaumont, a young designer, who created the'Know Your Lemons' campaign, which has been shared more than 32,000 times on Facebook in the past few days.\n\nShe lost both her grandmothers to breast cancer at the ages of 40 and 62 and when she found very little information on the signs of breast cancer to look out for, she felt compelled to come up with a solution.\n\nLemons became her stand-in metaphor for breasts as she tried to create a simple, visual way of showing what breast cancer symptoms can look and feel like.\n\nCorrine describes the egg box of lemons as a playful, friendly image which might help women overcome their fear of the disease.\n\n\"Some patients don't want to talk about breasts or look at them,\"she says. \n\n\"Often women used in campaigns don't look like ordinary women - but even those with little literacy can understand this.\"\n\nThe campaign has been used to educate people in the US, Spain, Turkey and Lebanon - and translated into 16 different languages.\n\nJoin the debate on our Facebook page.\n\nTwo years ago Corrine left her job to start her own charity, Worldwide Breast Cancer.\n\n'Real information'\n\nAlthough'Know Your Lemons' has been going since 2003, this year's zesty campaign image has struck a chord, after it was shared on social media by Erin Smith Chieze.\n\nShe was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer after recognising she had an indentation in her breast, all thanks to a similar image detailing what breast cancer could look like.\n\n\"Without having seen a picture randomly with real information, I wouldn't have known what to look for,\"Erin posted.\n\nMany say'Know Your Lemons' is clear and colourful - and gets an important message across that is often lost in a mass of words.\n\nAnd they have a point.\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 women by charity Breast Cancer Care found that a third of women don't check their breast regularly for signs and symptoms of cancer.\n\nWhile 96% know that a lump in the breast can be a symptom of cancer, more than a quarter did not know that an inverted nipple can be a symptom.\n\nA lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast is the most common symptom of breast cancer which women notice, NHS Choices says.\n\nIn 9 out of 10 cases these lumps are not cancer, but it's always a good idea to visit your GP to check.\n\nOther common symptoms to look out for are dimpling of the skin, indentations in the breast and a change in the position of the nipple.\n\nLemon-aid\n\nProf Jayant Vaidya, professor of surgery and oncology at University College London, says indentation or flattening of the breast, particularly when the arm is lifted or when women lean forward, is an important early sign. \n\n\"Apart from bloody or single duct discharge from the nipple, it is the main visible early sign.\"\n\nBut he says that growing veins and inflamed breasts are rare symptoms, and skin erosion, orange peel skin and large bumps are signs of advanced disease. \n\n\"Showing lemons in an egg box seems to draw interest and attention to the issue and people may remember the signs better. \n\n\"But women will usually find the new'invisible' lump in their breasts; it is the most common and frequently the only symptom.\"\n\nIn the UK, awareness is already at a pretty high level, so delay is more likely due to fear or denial, he says.\n\n\"Modern targeted treatments have a high chance of success and are aimed at reducing the harms of over-treatment,\"Prof Vaidya adds.\n\nGet more advice from:\n\nWhat is important, breast cancer charities say, is being aware of how your own breasts feel normally and then looking out for any unusual changes.\n\nA change in size or shape, a lump or thickening anywhere in the breast should be taken seriously.\n\nRoutine checking\n\nHowever, Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says she doesn't want people to become paranoid about breast cancer.\n\n\"It's about everyone becoming familiar with their own body and knowing what your own breast look like.\n\n\"You can introduce self-checking as part of a routine, when you're putting on creams and lotions, for example.\"\n\nCancer Research UK points out that spotting a sign doesn't necessarily mean cancer.\n\n\"Inverted nipples, fluid leaking from a nipple or a rash can all be due to other medical conditions. \n\n\"But if you have any changes to what is normal for you, you should see your GP. \n\n\"Seeing your doctor early also means that if it does turn out to be cancer, you give yourself the best chance of successful treatment.\"\nTL;DR: We think we know what the signs of breast cancer are, until it comes to checking our own breasts - then we're not so sure.\n\nArticle: Sheeran, 22, said he wanted to live somewhere that incorporates music, countryside and a relaxed atmosphere.\n\n\"Nashville is full of very, very nice people,\"said the A-Team singer.\n\nThe city is already home to some of country music's top stars and acts from the pop and rock world including Taylor Swift, where he wrote a duet with her. \n\nJack White and the Black Keys are among artists who have moved to Nashville, also known as Music City, in the last few years. \n\nSpeaking to Newsbeat at the Brit Awards in February the singer said:\"I think it's important to give the UK public a little bit of a break. \n\n\"I've been here for a long time doing TV and radio so I'm going to go over there and make the album and tour for a bit.\"\n\nHe said that he's\"got the songs\"for a follow-up to 2011's +, which reached number five in America's Billboard 200 Chart.  \n\n'I love America'\n\nEd Sheeran says that unlike Los Angeles and New York, Nashville doesn't have paparazzi on the lookout for celebrities. \n\n\"I don't think people really care in Nashville,\"he said.\n\n\"Even if they knew who you were, I don't think they'd care.

This will be quite good, to do it with my family, just the four of us, it is something personal.\n\n\"We will still be socialising, but we are also very safe and healthy and sticking by rules.\"\n\nTalawat Rahman is living in Birmingham with his friend Shabir Ahmed, Shabir's parents, Rosemin and Shafiq, and their grandson, Abdul-Rahman. It means Talawat will be away from his parents and siblings during Ramadan and for the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan.\n\n\"One reason I decided to stay in Birmingham and didn't return to London after university was the community atmosphere here,\"he said.\n\n\"In Ramadan, thousands congregate to share their evening meals and build a family they didn't have before, it is a magical time. Going without that will be very different.\n\n\"I'm used being able to go every Ramadan between Birmingham and my parents in Newcastle, this will be the first time I can't be with my younger siblings, with my parents, more than ever I will be relying on digital resources to stay in contact with them.\n\n\"On Eid day waking up and it just being another day, where the most exciting place I will be able go is to Tesco and back after a long 30 days fasting and reflection and prayer, is pretty sad,\n\n\"I won't be able to go to my parents' home, I'm not the only person who will have to experience that for the first time, but that will be an emotional challenge, to be honest.\"\n\nIn Burton-upon-Trent, Majid Waris is part of Humanity Unites, which runs a regular food bank in the town.\n\nIt has now started delivering food parcels and has been allowing people to collect food in way that meets social distancing guidelines. \n\n\"As Muslims we are taught to be charitable in our nature, Ramadan is perfect because it is like a whole month to reflect on ourselves,\"he said.\n\n\"It is a month to reflect and recalibrate, that is the best way I can put it. \n\n\"It helps you appreciate what you do have in life, what is important, which is kind of what we are being forced to do now during the lockdown.\n\n\"At Ramadan it is a little bit challenging, because we are cooking food while fasting, but I see it as a test for humanity, how are you going to continue fulfilling duties while being challenged, and it gives you a better understanding of the make-up of society and what is happening out there.\"\n\nAther Hussain, an Imam from Leicester, said the community had already felt how things have changed.\n\n\"Many mosques have gone to the effort of picking up the phone and ringing regular worshippers and seeing how they're getting on at home and many have doubled up as food couriers,\"he said.\n\n\"They are still serving humanity. The nature of the worship has changed.\"\n\nHe said there were additional prayers, unique to Ramadan, which they would miss out on. \n\n\"The other part is the social aspect. We share food together, we sit and pray together, and spur each other on,\"he said.\n\n\"We will still fast and pray. We will give money online. \n\n\"We will still look out for one another.\"\n\nHe said, instead of worshippers going to the mosque to break fast in the evening, most mosques in Leicester would be broadcasting on Facebook live to share the moment.\n\nAmina Koroma, an actor and playwright from London, has set up Ramadan Online, an online facility for women to maintain community and achieve their spiritual goals during Ramadan. \n\n\"It is such a communal time with the mosque as the hub where we come to pray, come to eat, just catch up with friends and family.\n\n\"If we are working so much during the year, we can take this time to focus inwardly, and the mosque is the place that helps us to do that.\n\n\"I thought the lack of access might have shaken them a little bit, these are really unprecedented circumstances. I would say they have maybe never experienced a Ramadan like this before, and I wanted to create a resource that would help them find some semblance of community.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

This is a person I don't know, I assume she's new,\"he told reporters. \n\n\"I think she dishonoured herself and dishonoured her family using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.\"\n\nWhen asked about her call for impeachment, Mr Trump responded:\"You can't impeach somebody that's doing a great job that's the way I view it.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, he tweeted that his political enemies only want to remove him from office because he is\"the most successful\". \n\nWhat did Ms Tlaib say?\n\nMichigan's Ms Tlaib made the remark to supporters at a reception hours after she was sworn in on Thursday as one of the first two Muslim women members of Congress.\n\n\"People love you and you win,\"she said.\"And when your son looks at you and says,'Momma, look you won. Bullies don't win.' And I said,'Baby, they don't.'\"\n\nShe added that they would impeach Mr Trump, using a profane term to describe him.\n\nMs Tlaib had also co-authored an opinion piece calling for impeachment that was published in the Detroit Free Press earlier on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, she was unapologetic about the furore over her remark.\n\nThe new congresswoman took her oath of office using a family Koran while wearing a traditional garment stitched by her Palestinian-born mother.\n\nPalestinian dress worn in new US Congress\n\nWhat did Pelosi say?\n\nSpeaking at an MSNBC town hall on Friday, Ms Pelosi said while she may have a\"generational reaction\"to the language, she is\"not in the censorship business\".\n\n\"I don't like that language, I wouldn't use that language, but I wouldn't establish any language standards for my colleagues.\n\n\"But I don't think it's anything worse than what the president has said.\"\n\nOn impeachment, Ms Pelosi has been cautious, saying Democrats must\"wait and see\"what happens with special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election.\n\nMr Trump told reporters on Friday Ms Pelosi assured him in budget negotiations that House Democrats were not looking to impeach him.\n\nWhat did other Democrats say?\n\nA number of Democratic congressmen rebuked the new lawmaker.\n\nCivil rights icon John Lewis said Ms Tlaib's comments were\"inappropriate\"and\"distracting\". The Georgia congressman also said talk of impeachment was\"a little premature\".\n\nEmanuel Cleaver of Missouri said:\"What she said yesterday was wrong. Wrong is wrong.\"\n\nJerry Nadler of New York told CNN:\"I don't really like that kind of language, but more to the point it is too early to talk about [impeachment] intelligently.\"\n\nBut Ms Tlaib is not the only hardline Democrat to call for Mr Trump's removal from office.\n\nBrad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas on Thursday reintroduced articles of impeachment against the president.\n\nMr Sherman responded to claims that impeachment talks were distracting from the shutdown battle by saying:\"Does it compete for attention? Yes. So do the Lakers' games,\"the Associated Press reported.\n\nAs for Ms Tlaib's controversial language, much like Ms Pelosi, California congresswoman Maxine Waters said Mr Trump was responsible for starting all the incivility.\n\n\"He's opened up a new way of talking, a new way of addressing these issues in ways that we never heard before,\"Ms Waters said, according to The Hill. \n\n\"That gives others the permission to speak passionately about it in the same manner that he has done.\"\n\nItching for a fight\n\nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\n\nThe newly elected Democrats in the House of Representatives don't look like the membership of past Congresses. It appears they won't sound like them, either.\n\nWhile the party elders, from Nancy Pelosi on down, are preaching restraint and patience with their newly gained power, the rank and file may have different ideas. They are itching for a fight, and they're more than willing to let everyone know.\n\nRashida Tlaib, with her obscenity laced call for the president's impeachment Thursday night, only drives that point home.\n\nMs Pelosi has earned a reputation as a skilled manager and tactician, but she must now walk a fine line in expressing disapproval of Ms Tlaib's remarks - which could complicate ongoing negotiations with Republicans over the budget - while acknowledging the power of the sentiments that they reflect. This will only be the first test of her ability to bridge the generational, strategic and stylistic divides within her party.\n\nThe reality, however, is that the civility ship has long since sailed in American politics. Donald Trump did not win the presidency by following the rules and norms of discourse, and the new Democrats appear more than ready to join the fray on his terms, whether Ms Pelosi wants them to or not.\n\nHow did Republicans react?\n\nRepublicans were quick to condemn the remarks.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Ms Pelosi ought to make clear to Ms Tlaib that such language is unacceptable.\n\n\"I think this is a role as a leader and a speaker to have a conversation with this member,\"he told reporters on Friday. \n\n\"Are the House majority going to be serious about anything?\"\n\nMore on this story:\n\nMore women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.\n\nWhat does it mean for Congress - and America?\nTL;DR: US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi Speaker has shrugged off a new lawmaker's use of a profane epithet to assail President Donald Trump.\n\nArticle: Dolly Evans worked for the Gibb family at The Grove, Ramsey during the 1930s.\n\nA museum spokesman said information was needed for the History in Heels project which aims to shine a light on some of the island's\"remarkable women\".\n\nNicola Tooms, Curator at Manx National Heritage, said she hopes the community can help fill in the gaps.\n\nShe added:\"As is often the case with the lives of working-class women, her story is less well documented, but we are eager to learn more about her.\n\n\"As part of our'History in Heels' project we wanted to highlight the story of The Grove, a matriarchal household if ever there was one, with Grannie, Auntie, and the two girls, Janet and Alice Gibb. \n\n\"We know a fair amount about the lives of the Misses Gibb through the archives we acquired from them but not much is known about another female member of the'below stairs' household, their maid Dolly\".\n\nThe Gibbs, a wealthy merchant family from Liverpool, built The Grove as a summer retreat in about 1840.\n\nIt is now a museum run by Manx National Heritage.\n\nThe History in Heels project aims to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the formation of the Isle of Man Women's Institute.\nTL;DR: The Isle of Man museum has appealed for information about a \"below stairs\" maid from the 1930s, ahead of the launch of a woman's history project in March.\n\nArticle: Pearce gained cult status for playing the ruthless but stylish leader of the evil Federation from 1978-81.\n\nShe was also known to Doctor Who fans for her role in 1985's The Two Doctors.\n\nWriter Russell T Davies described her as\"a truly fine actor\"as well as\"glorious, vivid, passionate, filthy and the most wonderful company\".\n\nPearce worked with Davies in his first TV drama Dark Season, which was shown in 1991 and also starred a young Kate Winslet.\n\nPearce trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts alongside Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt.

Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. \n\nThe council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast.\n\nNo homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed.\n\nElsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly.\n\n\"We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,\"Mr Williams urged.\n\nThe changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on.\n\nSome 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes\"all around us\".\n\nThey include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe.\n\n\"A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,\"he said.\n\nBut overall he claimed there were more\"losers than winners\"for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline.\n\n\"We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,\"he added.\n\nThe salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences.\n\nAs a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it.\n\nThe\"headache\"- as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats.\n\n\"Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect.\"\n\nFarmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future.\n\nDr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold.\n\nHundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions.\n\n\"This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,\"Dr Corke explained.\n\n\"Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering.\n\n\"By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,\"she said. \n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to\"re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency\".\n\n\"Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market.

This idea - which has fans in Westminster and Whitehall - strikes me as a misreading of the situation in Europe.\n\nThis idea has arisen because Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, is a game theorist, a type of economist who studies interactions in simplified versions of reality. \n\nThese stylised scenarios are known, in the jargon, as\"games\". Famous ones you might have heard of include\"the Stag Hunt\",\"The Ultimatum Game\"and - most famously -\"the Prisoner's Dilemma\". \n\nOne famous game is called\"Chicken\". Imagine two cars racing towards one another. If neither swerves, both drivers lose. If either swerves, however, that person is deemed to lose. \n\nThis is a bit like the Greek negotiation. Neither side wants to give in first, but neither side wants to end with no deal. \n\nThis is a hard game to be good at - unless you can send a worrying signal to the driver of the other car. \n\nYou could try to convince the other driver that you have no control of the car, so they will be forced to move. \n\nInside options and outside options\n\nRip off the steering wheel and wave it out of the window, perhaps? Or you could behave like you enjoy crashes - or are indifferent to the pain they cause. That, Lord Finkelstein has suggested, was part of the Greek negotiating strategy.\n\n Lord Finkelstein wrote:\"Varoufakis believed that if his negotiating partners - the Germans, the IMF, the Commission - concluded he was a bit bonkers, a bit reckless, they would appreciate that he might crash the Greek economy and bring down the whole edifice of the euro on top of him. Persuading your adversary that you are mad is a classic game theory gambit.\"\n\nI think you can understand the Greek position much more simply: they predicated their negotiating position on notions that turned out to be untrue. \n\nHere is another simple idea from game theory: a classic negotiation between two parties is best understood by looking at ideas called the\"outside option\"and the\"inside option\". \n\nThe outside option is the outcome for each individual if the negotiation fails. The inside option is what you get if the negotiation is completed. Negotiation is usually the process of changing the value of the inside option.\n\nIf you are trying to buy a car from a salesperson, then the outside option is walking away - keep your cash, take no car and retain the option of starting a negotiation with other salespeople. \n\nFor the seller, the outside option means keeping the car, having less cash and retaining the option of selling that car to someone else. \n\nFair and free negotiations will usually fail unless the inside option is better than the outside option. \n\nGreek assumptions\n\nIf it is better not to agree for any party, they won't. My assumption (largely based on Duncan's great reporting) is that Mr Varoufakis, a few months ago, thought that the outside option for Europe was gruesome. \n\nSo he could demand a lot, and they would still agree because it would be better for them.\n\nFor example, we know that he estimated that a messy Greek default would lead to financial contagion: for the sake of not saving little Greece, Europe could make investors worry about lending to Portugal, Spain or Italy. \n\nHe wrote in 2012\"the notion that Europe is ready for a Grexit is absurd.\"\n\nMeasures then under way by the ECB could not limit\"the damage on Spain, then Italy etc.\"\n\nIn short, if Europe did not cut a deal, Greece would rip Europe in two. That would make the outside option for Europe a catastrophe. \n\nAnd Mr Varoufakis also assumed that the outside option for Greece was not all that bad. That means his hand, in a negotiation, would be very strong.\n\nThat is because, quite recently, Greece was running a so-called\"primary surplus\"earlier this year. \n\nThat means if it got cut off from financial markets because it failed to pay its debtors, it could still keep its public services running. \n\nI would presume he also thought the banks would be kept afloat by the European Central Bank: in previous chapters of the crisis, it actually rewrote its own rules to keep the banks open and liquid in Greece. \n\nIn that situation, Mr Varoufakis thought the damage of a failure to agree would be much worse to Europe than it would be to Greece.\n\nAnd, in that situation, the best strategy for Greece is to wait. This isn't a\"madman\"strategy. It's a quite rational calculation about the outside option. \n\nSo he wanted to wait for investors to start fretting and fussing, for bond yields to rise, for bank shares to start shedding value and for a credit squeeze to start moving through Europe.  \n\nIf contagion ever made it look like Spain or - heaven forbid - the vast Italian debt could not be serviced, the Eurogroup would race to offer a deal to Greece on good terms. \n\nThere was a catch, though. All of his assumptions were wrong.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nFirst, investors have been very unconcerned by Greek default. They see the politics and arithmetic of Greece as different to the rest of the continent and do not see parallels between them. \n\nSo the market panics never came. The Eurogroup could afford to wait.\n\nSecond, Greece nosedived into recession. It is surely not now running a primary surplus. \n\nThat means that Greece needs help just to run the existing level of public services. That means pain to Greece for not being able to access new financing. It cannot wait.\n\nThird, the ECB did not keep Greece's banks going, which means the economy is being suffocated. \n\nEvery day that this runs on makes the situation worse, businesses being shut down and individuals suffering. This whole scenario is dismal for the Greeks - and worsens every day.\n\nIn short, the outside option turns out, in the past few weeks, to have been much worse for Greece and a lot less damaging to the rest of Europe than they thought. \n\nSo the inside option they thought they might be able to extract from the rest of Europe turns out to be much worse than they once imagined. \n\nThat all strikes me as a simpler explanation of the Syriza strategy than a\"madman at the wheel\"gambit. \n\nIndeed, put this argument another way: if you were to pursue that strategy, would you do it like this? \n\nIf I were pursuing that approach, I would start openly preparing for a messy default and exit from the Eurozone. \n\nThis is not to say that I think Syriza solely misjudged the economics. \n\nNatural allies in Rome and Paris were alienated. Syriza misunderstood what role the US State Department would play. \n\nThey made it politically difficult for German and Dutch politicians to help them. \n\nThey also behaved, at times, as though the governments who lend them money do not have their own democratic mandates.\n\nBut I think a misreading the outside option for the rest of Europe is a major part of what went wrong - not a failed plea of insanity.\nTL;DR: Was the Greek negotiating strategy with the Eurogroup designed to convince the rest of Europe that the Syriza government was mad?\n\nArticle: Police raided a property in Ide in Devon on Monday and seized thousands of pounds worth of suspected Class A drugs, cash and firearms.\n\nTwo men, aged 25 and 66, were arrested on suspicion of Class A drug supply offences and money laundering.

His choice of transport has come under criticism for being too lavish given his promises to make bureaucrats and politicians tighten their belts. \n\nBut it was the defence offered by Information Minister Fawad Chaudry which sparked widespread scorn on social media. Speaking at a press conference he claimed the helicopter was an inexpensive option costing as little 55 rupees ($0.45, \u00a30.34) per km. \n\n\"I have seen this on Google,\"he added.\n\nPeople were sceptical that travel by helicopter could be so cheap. #Helicopter became the top Twitter trend in Pakistan on Monday with over 16,000 tweets using the hashtag and many making jokes about the claim.\n\nMr Khan's cost of transport was compared to Careem, a ride-hailing smartphone app in Pakistan. \n\nThe Careem Twitter account also got in on the joke by mocking up a version of their app offering flights.\n\nHow much does it actually cost?\n\nWas people's scepticism over the information minister's claim justified? The short answer is yes. \n\nAccording to research by BBC Urdu, the fuel for the prime minister's helicopter, an Agusta Westland AW139, costs 1,600 Rupees ($13, \u00a310) per km, higher than the 55 rupees Mr Chaudry claimed.

How do they avoid being sidelined in an era of fake news and attention-seeking punditry?\n\nThis is the challenge for the British Academy, the national body for the humanities and social sciences, which is throwing open the doors of its London headquarters for a summer showcase, promising\"ideas for curious minds\".\n\nGetting people across the threshold is the first challenge, she says. The British Academy is based in an elegant building near St James's Park in central London. It's a place dedicated to public culture, but wants to stop looking like a private club.\n\n\"You can see why people might be a bit intimidated,\"says Dame Mary, a fellow of the academy.\n\n\"But what the television shows you is that ideas are not the preserve of posh white men.\"\n\n'No sloganising'\n\nShe wants to open up academic debates to a wider public, but she says a really important part of the message must be to make people realise that things can be\"complicated\".\n\n\"You don't need to be an expert to have a view of Roman politics,\"she says, such as whether it was right to assassinate Julius Caesar. \n\nBut whatever your view, she says there has to be a recognition of the moral and political complexity of such decisions.\n\n\"Everyone can join in, but it doesn't mean you can shoot your mouth off.\"Opinions shouldn't be untroubled by thought.\n\nA by-product of the advance of social media, she says, is the tendency to\"sloganise\"and to turn every argument into a one-dimensional sound-bite.\n\nIdeas can be complicated and divisive, she says, and she takes umbrage at the type of people who think everyone should agree about everything.\n\nDame Mary says she gets annoyed when people on Twitter say they are\"disappointed\"in her views. She says they're\"patronising\"and can't stand people having their own opinions.\n\n'Death threats'\n\nThe British Academy's august building was once the home of 19th Century prime minister William Gladstone. It's hard to think what such a high-minded statesman would have made of being shouted at on Twitter.\n\nDame Mary has been subject to dreadful online abuse, but she still argues for the benefits of engaging with people and their thoughts on social media.\n\n\"You don't think - great, death threats,\"she says. \n\nBut she's still ready to get into arguments, even though there is a likely risk of it all descending into\"lots of sexist rants\".\n\n\"It's a combination of anger, outrage and appalling self-righteousness,\"she says of too many social media exchanges.\n\nIt's not the rudeness that really rankles, she says, because\"being rude is part of the human condition\".\n\nWhat really annoys her is the over-simplification and the refusal to recognise that some problems can be complicated and nuanced and not sorted out by a shouting match.\n\nSuch public thinkers might feel that they're not running with the grain of the times.\n\nFake news\n\nThe academy's president, historian Professor Sir David Cannadine, warns against a populist mood in which decisions are made on\"gut instincts\"rather than evidence.\n\n\"In the world of fake news there is a distrust of experts which is wholly regrettable,\"says Sir David.\n\nInstitutions such as the British Academy might be engaged in advancing knowledge, but he says they might not be\"very good at explaining themselves\".\n\nSir David wants the open days to persuade people of the relevance of the humanities - to show that they are at the heart of\"private recreations and public culture\".\n\nThe summer showcase will have talks and presentations and displays on history, music, art, literature and the future of work.\n\nIt's also making a case for internationalism -

A previous test for seven year olds was ditched when questions were accidentally published online. \n\nAnd the baseline tests, intended for the reception calls, were called off when a pilot study showed the results were unreliable.\n\nThis has been in addition to a parents' protest and complaints that tougher tests are so difficult that even ministers struggle to answer them. Not to mention the U-turn on academies.\n\nMinisters will feel themselves unlucky. But the Labour opposition will claim that the government's education team is losing its credibility.\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell said the leak was a further\"body blow to parent and teacher confidence\"in how the primary testing system was being run.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4's World at One programme she said the matter was\"not an isolated incident\".\n\n\"The government has woefully mismanaged and caused absolute chaos and confusion in primary assessment and it's a travesty for those kids, it really is.\"\n\nMs Powell has now written to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, saying there is\"no confidence\"among parents, teachers and school leaders in this year's primary assessments.\n\nThe letter calls on Mrs Morgan to offer a guarantee that primary schools will not be forced to become an academy on the basis of the tests.\n\n'More rigorous'\n\nChristine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said the tests should be scrapped for this year.\n\n\"We didn't like the tests in the first place, but the fact is the tests are compromised and it just adds to the general sense of chaos, about not just the curriculum but in particular about assessment this year.\"\n\nThe new tests have been drawn up to assess children's grasp of the recently-introduced primary school national curriculum, which is widely considered to be harder than the previous one.\n\nThe more challenging tests have been controversial - with parents claiming they make children stressed and anxious.\n\nAlmost 50,000 parents have signed a petition calling for a boycott of primary school tests and some kept their children off school on 3 May in protest.\n\nThe government has said it is determined to raise standards and the tests reflect the\"more rigorous curriculum\", but that they should not cause pupils stress.\n\nThe debacle follows a government climbdown last week on plans to force all schools to become academies.\nTL;DR: A \"rogue marker\" leaked a test the day before it was taken on Tuesday by children aged 10 and 11 in England, the Department for Education has said.\n\nArticle: The band from south London had been selected to take part in the judges' houses section of the competition. \n\nNigerian born Kazeem Ajobo had applied for a visa which would allow him to travel to the United States and then return to the UK.\n\n\"We are gutted that we have had to leave the competition as we were having such a great time,\"he said.\n\nAlthough he put in the visa application before the latter stages of the competition it wasn't processed in time for their trip to Las Vegas. \n\nIt's where music manager Louis Walsh was due to decide if they would progress to the X Factor live shows. \n\nThe 23-year-old singer added:\"Hopefully, if everything is OK with my visa, we can apply again next year.\"\n\nRough Copy also includes Sterling Ramsay, 24 and Joseph Thomas, 25. \n\nUnion J and Times Red, two bands who were eliminated earlier in the talent show process, will replace Rough Copy.\nTL;DR: X Factor contestants Rough Copy have been forced to quit the show after one of its members failed to get a visa.\n\nArticle: The quango said it still intended to press ahead with long-term plans to cut its workforce by about 1,550. \n\nBut it said discussions with staff who might be affected would be delayed until\"current flooding has subsided\".\n\nLabour has claimed the jobs of 550 flooding specialists are at risk from the shake-up but the Agency said this was not currently being considered.\n\nThe Agency has been criticised for its performance in recent weeks and for its past policy on river dredging in Somerset, one of the worst-affected areas.\n\nBut its chairman Lord Smith, whose own position has come under pressure, has praised the dedication and professionalism of its frontline staff, many of whom have been working non-stop since the start of December.\n\nThe Agency, which has an annual budget of \u00a31.2bn, announced plans last year to reduce staff numbers from 11,250 to about 9,700 in response to a cut in the amount of money it gets from central government.\n\n'Change programme'\n\nIt has never specified which departments would be affected and it has now confirmed that it has postponed a consultation on potential redundancies until the current crisis is over.\n\n\"We are prioritising incident response above all other work,\"said its programme director Toby Willison.\n\n\"With this in mind, we are reviewing the timetable for the Environment Agency's change programme and will not be entering a formal consultation with staff until the current flooding has subsided.\n\n\"Once we move out of incident response mode, we will refocus our efforts to continue to bring Environment Agency costs in line with our budget from government for 2014-15.\"\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband highlighted job cuts at the Agency during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, urging the government to reconsider what he said was the threat to 550 flood specialists' jobs. \n\nThe BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the 550 figure may have come from an internal exercise into future changes but it had never been confirmed and the organisation said it was not being considered.\n\nThe Agency insisted that any future reductions in staff would not affect\"its ability to respond to flooding incidents\", adding that it would minimise the impact on other frontline services as well.\n\n'Stay of execution'\n\nSpeaking before the Agency's announcement, David Cameron said the reported job cuts had never been confirmed.\n\n\"Those aren't plans that are going to be put in place,\"he said.\"Of course every organisation has to make sure it is efficient -

It will become easier for private institutions to enter the market, with 20,000 student places reserved for institutions that can offer courses costing below \u00a37,500 per year.\n\nTwo university leaders discuss the likely effects of the plans on their institutions.\n\nUniversity of West London:'Squeezed middle' fears\n\nProfessor Peter John, Vice Chancellor of the University of West London, says he supports the idea of using price as a mechanism for driving student choice, and backs competition\"as long as it's fair\".\n\nBut he believes the University of West London, which is charging \u00a37,500 tuition fees, could find itself in the\"squeezed middle\"under the changes.\n\nThis would mean being caught between the universities allowed to expand place numbers for talented students, and those allowed to expand because they are charging the lowest fees.\n\nInstitutions such as his may find their numbers are capped below current levels and have to turn qualified students away, he says, especially if overall student numbers decline if students are put off by higher fees. \n\n\"Perhaps we may lose 20-30% of our student cohort,\"he says.\n\n\"That's a real concern because we offer students who are the first in their families to go into higher education the opportunity, and to deny that to a large section of the population would be a retrograde step.\"\n\nSome 58% of the university's intake comes from households with average or below average earnings, and only 14 students are from independent schools, he points out.\n\nHe is critical of the plan to allow universities to expand place numbers for students achieving the equivalent of AAB A-level grades or higher.\n\n\"I don't think that's widening participation - it is simply sharing out a small number of students into the higher universities. All students that have the required qualifications should be given the choice to go to university and it shouldn't be narrowed to a small number,\"he says.\n\nDavid Allen, registrar and deputy chief executive of Exeter University, broadly welcomed the government's proposals for increased competition between universities, including private institutions.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned - bring it on, as long as we're all on a level playing field - I think competition drives down price and drives innovation,\"he said.\n\n\"From our point of view, as one of the top universities, near the top of the food chain, if we can recruit very good students and still provide them with an excellent experience, that's what we would want to do.\"\n\nBut universities more likely to struggle to attract students need to\"realise that they're competing in a very competitive world\"he said.\n\nExeter University has some 20,000 applicants for about 3,500 places every year, he says.\n\nBut even so, the university is\"investing quite heavily\"in marketing and will be\"very aggressively presenting ourselves\"to prospective students at open days, he adds.\n\nThe university is spending \u00a3400m developing its campuses, and is planning a\"contract\"between students and the university, outlining what students will get for their money and what is expected of them.\n\nMr Allen stresses the full\"Exeter student experience\", which mixes academic study with employment preparation and cultural and sports opportunities, and acknowledges that too much growth in numbers could undermine it.\n\n\"We certainly wouldn't want to expand too much\u2026  we've invested very heavily so we do have the facilities available \u2026 and given that we're not planning a very big expansion I think our facilities will be fine,\"he says.\n\nHe says the current period is the most exciting time he can remember in 36 years working in higher education.\n\n\"It's liberating,\"he says.\"If the new regime does free up the market, and reduce or eliminate student quotas, I think it will be very important for the country, and very important for the leading universities to have that choice and diversity and to be masters of their own destiny, rather than told what to do by the government.\"\nTL;DR: Ministers have outlined plans to increase competition between universities. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Reality Check teamBBC News\n\nWe have looked at some of the claims made by Mr Modi about India's handling of the pandemic. \n\nClaim:\"We are seeing a decline in the number of cases per day and in the growth rate of cases... because India was one of the first countries to adopt a flexible lockdown when total cases were a few hundred.\"\n\nVerdict: It's true India's infection numbers are falling. But it wasn't the only country to lock down when case numbers were relatively low and countries have seen variable results from lockdowns.\n\nIndia's daily reported case numbers have been coming down since peaking around the middle of September, and week on week, there's been a drop in the rate of growth in new confirmed cases.\n\nThe number of deaths reported daily has also been declining.\n\nEvaluating the impact of lockdown is difficult because countries vary in the amount of testing they do, and therefore in the number of cases they confirm.\n\nThey have also imposed different types of restrictions on their populations.\n\nLockdown in India began on 25 March, when there were 562 cases and nine deaths. The nationwide lockdown continued for 68 days, until 1 June, when India had 190,535 cases and began easing restrictions on movement. \n\nDuring lockdown, case numbers grew more than five-fold.\n\nSome neighbouring countries implemented lockdowns around the same time or before India did, when their case numbers were also relatively low.\n\nNepal went into lockdown on 24 March, a day before India, when it had just two confirmed cases, and Sri Lanka locked down on 22 March when it had 78 cases.\n\nCountries such as Peru and New Zealand also locked down early. Peru went into lockdown on 16 March, when it had 71 cases, and continued until the end of June - the longest lockdown in Latin America. \n\nBut there, case numbers continued to grow exponentially, reaching more than 282,000 by the end of June, when restrictions in Peru were lifted.\n\nNew Zealand saw cases grow during the lockdown, with the numbers increasing more than six-fold. But it's worth adding that the country has been testing more than others, so would find more cases.\n\nClaim: \"Out of every million, we have around 83 deaths. This is compared to other nations, which see around 600 deaths per million in US, Brazil, Britain, Spain.\"\n\nVerdict: It's true that India's numbers are much lower, but experts also warn that a significant number of Covid deaths could be going unreported. \n\nIndia has recorded just over 83 deaths per million people so far due to coronavirus, which is much lower than the 665 deaths per million in the US, 644 in the UK, 725 in Brazil and 727 in Spain.\n\nCurrently, India, with 17% of the global population, accounts for 10% of all deaths from Covid. This compares with the United States, which has around 4% of the global population and 20% of all deaths.\n\nIt also has a low case fatality rate - the proportion of people who contract Covid-19 who die.\n\nThere might be various explanations for this, such as the younger age profile of the population.\n\nBut there are also questions about whether India is capturing all Covid deaths in its official data.\n\nAnd countries record deaths in different ways, so exact comparisons can be difficult.\n\nIt's also worth saying there are other parts of the world with relatively low death rates, such as Africa. \n\nClaim:\"5,500 people out of every one million of population in India are infected, whereas in countries like the US and Brazil this figure is around 25,000.\"\n\nVerdict: The available data supports this claim. However, reported case numbers depend on how widely you test.\n\nIndia's current confirmed cases per million are much lower than both the US and Brazil, and lower than some other countries where the pandemic has taken hold.\n\nBut the number of confirmed cases is governed by testing - the more testing you do, the more cases you will find.\n\nWhen you look at tests done per capita, India has not done as many as other countries, although it has been ramping up its testing considerably.\n\nIt had done just over 69 tests per 1,000 people as of 20 October, whereas the UK had done 377 and the US 407.\n\nClaim:\"India was one of the earliest to deploy a rapid antigen test.\"\n\nVerdict: There are countries that approved these rapid coronavirus tests before India did, but there have been concerns over their accuracy.\n\nIndia approved rapid antigen tests on 14 June, and began using them on 18 June to scale up testing which until then had relied on the PCR test - the gold standard test but one which takes longer to process.\n\nOther countries had used them before. One of the first to approve antigen testing early on the pandemic was Belgium. Its federal agency for medicines and health products had, in March, certified the usage of an antigen test kit.\n\nBut it's not being used in Belgium any more, as\"the reliability of tests, particularly those detecting antigens and antibodies, is not always clearly proven and documented\", the government guidelines say. \n\nAnd the first antigen test kit to be approved in the US was on 9 May, followed by Japan, which approved its usage on 13 May.  \n\nIndia has approved the use of five antigen test kits - developed in South Korea, Belgium, Taiwan and two developed locally. \n\nBut it's worth noting that on the official Belgian list of approved rapid antigen tests, the one that India uses is no longer listed due to concerns about its reliability.\n\nSimilarly, South Korea, which has been exporting antigen-based test kits elsewhere, decided not use these tests at home due to the inaccuracies in test results, and continued to ramp up PCR testing instead.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been talking about the country's continuing battle against the coronavirus.\n\nArticle: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor\n\nYandex alleges that its rival has an unfair advantage because it insists device-makers set Google as the default search setting if they want to pre-install its Play store.\n\nGoogle Play is promoted as the safest and best-stocked marketplace for apps and other media for Android devices.\n\nGoogle has yet to respond.\n\nThe BBC understands the US company has yet to see the complaint filed with the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS).\n\nHowever, Google may try to defend itself by noting that manufacturers are free to install rival services if they choose not to pre-load its other software.\n\nIt is also likely to argue that customers can carry out searches via other software - including Yandex's search app - after buying an Android handset or tablet.\n\nIn the past, Microsoft and others have made similar complaints about Android to the European Commission, claiming that the operating system acts as a Trojan horse for Google's services.\n\nLast year, the commission said it would\"probably\"launch a formal investigation into the claims if it did not get an\"adequate\"response from Google. \n\nEU anti-trust watchdogs are already carrying out a separate investigation into Google's search and advertising business.\n\nMarket share drop\n\nYandex said that it had decided to act after three electronics comapnies - Prestigio, Fly and Explay - contacted it between last November and last month to say they were\"no longer able\"to pre-install Yandex's services on their Android devices because of Google's restrictions.\n\nIt said these included a take-it-or-leave-it rule, under which the manufacturers were forced to choose between installing the complete set of Google Mobile Services apps - including Google Play, Gmail, YouTube, Google Translate and Google Drive - and setting Google as the automatic search service, or opting out altogether.\n\nThe Moscow-based company added that Google was\"increasingly\"prohibiting device-makers from pre-installing competitors' services.\n\nA spokesman for Yandex acknowledged that it was possible for customers to subsequently download its own app. But he noted that, unlike in Apple's iOS operating system, users could not later reset the default search service from being Google in their settings menu.\n\nThe spokesman also told the BBC that Yandex's share of searches carried out via Android devices in Russia had fallen - down from 52% in February last year to 44% now - despite rising on iOS over the same period.\n\n\"We believe that device manufacturers should have a choice as to which search provider to set as the default or which services to have preinstalled on the device,\"added Yandex's PR director, Ochir Mandzhikov.\n\n\"This is why we are talking about the need to unbundle Google's Android operating system from Google Search and its other end-user services.\"\n\nRegulators at the FAS said they intended to respond to Yandex's complaint within a month.\n\n\"After the review, a decision will be made on launching a case or rejection,\"they said in a statement.\nTL;DR: Google faces the prospect of a fresh competition investigation after Russia's biggest search engine filed a complaint with the authorities.\n\nArticle: The economy contracted 0.4% from the month before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThe contraction meant growth for the three months to April slowed to 0.3%.\n\nFactory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit slashed UK car production in April by nearly half, the industry said last month.\n\nBMW's Mini factory in Oxford brought forward its summer maintenance shutdown to April to minimise any disruption surrounding Brexit. Other manufacturers' annual stoppages were also brought forward.\n\n'Hangover'\n\nThe economy had seen a spurt of growth in the run-up to the proposed March date for the UK leaving the European Union, as manufacturers stockpiled parts, raw materials and goods in the anticipation of holdups at the border.\n\nAfter the Brexit deadline was extended to October, it suffered the reverse effects as these supply reserves were used up and fewer purchases were made.\n\n\"The hangover that's followed the UK's original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated, said Yael Selfin, chief economist at accountants KPMG UK.\n\n\"Today's figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty.\"\n\nONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said:\"Growth showed some weakening across the latest three months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK's original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns.\n\n\"There was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK's original EU departure date has faded.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\nBy Jonty Bloom, business correspondent\n\nIf you are going to cancel a party it is always polite to give your guests as much notice as possible. After all, that could well save them the expense of buying a present, booking a baby sitter, splashing out on new clothes etc. \n\nUnfortunately Theresa May gave British industry only a few days' notice that Brexit was being postponed and it was just too late to stop carefully-honed plans swinging into operation. \n\nMany businesses feared Brexit would cause at least temporary disruption, so they had been stockpiling components and finished goods to tide them over, and they have been using those stores up rather than producing more.  \n\nThe car industry brought forward its annual shutdown - usually used to put in new equipment, prepare for new models and so on. As a result, car production fell off a cliff and manufacturing as a whole fell by nearly 4% in just one month. \n\nGrowth may bounce back, but then Brexit is now scheduled for 31 October. How do companies plan for that? Repeat the whole operation again or not bother? Certainly the car industry won't want another shutdown, it has already had one this year and Brexit could still be delayed again. \n\n'Sluggish growth'\n\nThe contraction in April was far sharper than economists had expected.\n\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest\"underlying growth is pretty sluggish\".\n\n\"With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year.\"\n\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has estimated car production for the whole of 2019 will be about 10% down on last year. It says the market might pick up by the end of the year if there is a favourable deal between the UK and the EU, and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market.\n\nBut it has said a no-deal Brexit will make the declines worse, with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said:\"While monthly figures are always changeable, the fundamentals of our economy are strong and it has grown every year since 2010. Employment levels are at a record high and wages growing in real terms.\"\nTL;DR: A \"dramatic\" fall in car production and an easing of stockpiling by manufacturers meant the economy shrank in April, official figures show.\n\nArticle: The move comes as the firm faces a series of questions from lawmakers and regulators around the world over its handling of personal data.\n\nThe change revolves around which users will be regulated via its European headquarters in Ireland. \n\nFacebook said it planned clearer privacy rules worldwide.\n\nThe move, reported by Reuters, will see Facebook users outside the EU governed by Facebook Inc in the US rather than Facebook Ireland.\n\nIt is widely seen as a way of the social network avoiding having to apply the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to countries outside the EU.\n\nThe change will affect more than 70% of its more than two billion members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the US and Canada and 370 million in Europe.\n\nIt also had 1.5 billion members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America, and they are the ones affected by the change. \n\nUsers in the US and Canada have never been subject to European rules.\n\n\"The GDPR and EU consumer law set out specific rules for terms and data policies which we have incorporated for EU users.  We have been clear that we are offering everyone who uses Facebook the same privacy protections, controls and settings, no matter where they live,\"said Stephen Deadman, deputy chief global privacy officer at Facebook.\n\nSylvia Kingsmill, a digital privacy expert at consultancy KPMG, said such moves were\"an easy way out\"for tech firms.\n\n\"I think that the public expectation is that their data, which they freely give up to corporate giants, is protected and I think this kind of move will catch up with the firms that make it.\"\n\nShe added that regulators and lawmakers in the US and Canada were working on their own laws that would reflect the same controls offered by the\"game-changing\"GDPR.\n\nPositive step\n\nIn 2008, Facebook set up its international headquarters in Ireland to take advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates but it also meant all users outside the US and Canada were protected by European regulations.\n\nThe change will mean users outside Europe will no longer be able to file complaints with the Irish data protection commissioner or in the Irish courts.\n\nGDPR, due to come into force next month, offers EU consumers far greater control over their data. It also promises to fine firms found to have breached data rules up to 4% of their annual global revenue.\n\nFacebook has been under extremely close scrutiny following revelations that up to 87 million users may have had their data harvested by political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent.\n\nIn his answers to Congress over Facebook's involvement in the scandal, Mark Zuckerberg said that GDPR was\"going to be a very positive step for the internet\".\n\nWhen asked whether the regulations should be applied in the US, he replied:\"I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection.\"\nTL;DR: Facebook has changed its terms of service, meaning 1.5 billion members will not be protected under tough new privacy protections coming to Europe.\n\nArticle: Pierre Storey, who lives in the 18-storey Mellish Court in Milton Keynes, said his children were confused and struggling without outdoor space. \n\nHe said he was also terrified they would catch the virus when going outside because it was\"impossible\"to social distance in the building.\n\nMilton Keynes Council said it was checking on tenants' welfare. \n\nMr Storey and his partner Jade Durrant, both 29, live in the two bedroom council flat with their four children, Ellis, 7, Theo, 4, Maisie, 2, and one-year-old Jack.\n\n\"As the days pass it's becoming much more of a struggle,\"Mr Storey said. \n\n\"The children are stressed and instead of playing they are taking their frustration out on each other, constantly squabbling, which adds to the stress.\"\n\nThe three youngest children did not understand why they could not play outside and the uncertainty surrounding the length of lockdown has been challenging, said Mr Storey, who was made unemployed when the lockdown started. \n\n\"They're genuinely stuck inside a small room with nothing but the TV and some toys to play with,\"said Mr Storey.\n\n\"We feel as if we're in a prison.\"\n\nHe said his children were finding lockdown especially tough because they could not access their seventh floor balcony because all the building's balconies were locked amid safety concerns last year. \n\n\"As a family we're not doing so well... I think they think they're being punished somehow. It's so sad,\"he said. \n\nThe family has been trying to go out at least once a day, in line with government advice, but Mr Storey said the situation was\"a nightmare\". \n\nBoth parents have become terrified their children may catch the virus in small, cramped communal spaces such as the lift, staircases and hallways where they said it could be impossible to social distance. \n\n\"The thought of my kids catching anything in between leaving and coming back into the property via the communal areas is very frustrating,\"Mr Storey said. \n\nA spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said:\"We are in the process of contacting council tenants to check they are OK and their property is safe.\"\n\nThe council has been contacting vulnerable residents first and would be investigating and addressing the balcony concerns after lockdown restrictions were lifted, it said. \n\nIt said it had recommended tenants followed social distancing guidelines.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

They are a creamy buff colour and are made from local stone. They are small in size, about one centimetre square, and carefully laid. \n\n\"Although we only have a few cubes of stone to go on we can confirm that from its position in the building sequence this must be the earliest mosaic yet known from the site dating to the later first century AD.\"\n\nThe excavations are taking place in advance of the Archway Project, which will provide state-of-the-art surroundings for visitors to the Roman Baths. \n\nAs part of the project, volunteers from BACAS have been helping professional archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology to carry out the dig. \n\nDr Sarah Morton, lecturer in heritage at Bath Spa University, said:\"This is an exciting find as it provides further evidence about the early phase of the baths.\n\n\"It is wonderful to find out that even at a site people know so well there are new surprises that are emblematic of Rome and yet made of local stone.\"\n\nThe major development - carried out by Bath and North East Somerset Council - will also provide a new World Heritage Centre for the city and is due to open in 2019.\nTL;DR: Archaeologists have made \"a very exciting discovery\" during excavations at an historic Roman baths site.\n\nArticle: By Shuja Malik & Reality Check teamBBC Urdu\n\nOne of the major players, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, has said that it would ensure equal access for women to education as well as health and employment.\n\nEarlier this year, Nobel Prize winner and champion of female education Malala Yousafzai went back to her home town after years away from the country. \n\nMalala was shot in the head in 2012 by the Pakistani Taliban, who had begun a violent campaign to force the closure of hundreds of schools.\n\nHer charitable organisation, the Malala Fund, has built schools to help hundreds of young girls access education so that\"every girl can learn and lead\".\n\nBut are there as many girls as boys now entering the education system in Pakistan?  \n\nOverall, there are still proportionally more boys than girls going to school - but there are signs of improvement for girls in some areas of Pakistan.\n\nNo real change\n\nBased on government data for 2017, that gap between the numbers of boys and girls in education is about 10% - this is from the 5th Grade (nine years old) up to the 12th Grade (17 years old).  \n\nThese figures have barely changed since the last elections in 2013.\n\nIt's also important to note that a significant proportion of students in government public schools - both boys and girls - drop out of school at primary level.\n\n\"One of the major factors contributing to the drop in post-primary enrolment is the [lack of] availability of schools at secondary level or above,\"says Aleena Khan, from Alif Ailaan, a non-profit organisation working on education in Pakistan.\n\n\"Almost 80% of [government] schools in Pakistan are primary schools.\"\n\nShe adds that where girls are out of school, the problem is typically not the attitude of the parents towards educating girls, but the lack of enough schools for girls.\n\nThe gap in the market is to some extent filled by private schools, which cater to all levels of education, but this sector is still smaller than the government sector.  \n\nHowever, even in private schools there is a gender gap - with a larger proportion of boys than girls enrolling.\n\nAnd this has not changed much in recent years.\n\nRegional variations\n\nThe national picture doesn't tell the whole story, however.  \n\nThere are significant differences between provinces (and within provinces), with government data showing more girls enrolled than boys in some areas. \n\nFor example, Pakistan's second largest city, Lahore, has more girls than boys enrolled in primary schools through to high school.  \n\nAnd another city in Punjab province, Sialkot, shows a similar trend. \n\nEarlier this year, Rana Mashood, the Education Minister in Punjab province, talked of a\"phenomenal increase\"in his province in girls education in the past two years.\n\nThe enrolment data for Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces shows an improvement since 2013.\n\nHowever, data for the enrolment of girls in both Sindh and Balochistan provinces shows a decline between 2013 and 2017.\n\nBaela Raza Jamil, chief executive of Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi, a charity that promotes access to education, says this reflects - with the exception of Punjab - a lack of specifically targeted programmes by provincial governments to address the gender imbalance.\n\n\"There is definitely a demand for girls' education in Pakistan,\"says Nadia Naviwala, a fellow with the Woodrow Wilson International Center. \n\nHowever, she adds:\"Pakistan is not a country that offers great education for boys or girls.

However the commitment is only for the next financial year,\"he said.\n\nBut Chris Keates, head of the NASUWT teachers' union, said:\"Despite the Chancellor's claims, the cuts announced today will hit jobs not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. These cuts could also seriously undermine education provision in schools.\"\nTL;DR: Extra university places and school services in England are to be cut in the coalition government's drive to reduce public spending.\n\nArticle: His draft budget includes drastic reductions or withdrawal of support for the homeless, people with learning difficulties and those with mental health issues.\n\nBefore releasing the details, the Devon mayor warned the cuts would be painful.\n\nOne housing charity described the reductions as\"absolutely devastating\".\n\nThe Leonard Stock Centre in Torquay has been told its \u00a3300,000 grant will be cut by \u00a3150,000.\n\nThe Shekinah Mission and national housing charity Chapter 1 are among the charities involved in running the centre which provides accommodation for 24 homeless people, many of whom have mental health problems and complex needs.\n\nChapter 1 is also involved in two other housing projects in Torbay for vulnerable people which could lose almost all their funding.\n\nThe Jatis Project provides accommodation and support for people with drug and alcohol issues in the Bay, while Reaching Out South West helps people with mental health issues.\n\nScott Caldwell from Jatis described the proposed cuts as\"insane\".\n\n\"To suggest that 75% of the budget is cut is insane in my opinion and family members will be affected,\"he said.\n\n'Tough conversations'\n\nChapter 1 said the proposals in the draft budget appeared to affect the most vulnerable people in Torbay.\n\n\"This is absolutely devastating - everyone is reeling,\"a Chapter 1 spokesman said.\n\n\"Its a very sad day for Torbay. These cuts will affect the most vulnerable who don't have the loudest of voices.\n\n\"Our desire to help will not go away, but there is only so much you can expect from volunteers.\n\n\"All we can do is hope there is a realistic consultation about these proposals because even if you withdraw the funding, the people are still there - they don't just go away.\"\n\nOther proposed cuts include withdrawing supported employment for people with learning difficulties, cutting funding for sheltered housing for older people. and withdrawing funding for accommodation for offenders on licence.\n\nMr Oliver, who declined to be interviewed, said\"significant\"government grant reductions, meant Torbay Council had to save \u00a322m over the next two years and no service would be immune.\n\n\"The scale of the challenge in achieving the central government savings which local MPs voted for, sadly means no service is immune and there have been some very tough conversations,\"he said.\n\n\"There are certainly no easy answers in this budget - it has and continues to be, a painful process.\"\n\nA public meeting will be held at the Riviera International Centre in Torquay on 2 December and local people will be able to have their say on the council's website.\n\nThe budget proposals will be reviewed in January and the final decision will be made in February.\nTL;DR: Torbay's most vulnerable people could be seriously affected by \u00a322m council budget cuts proposed by Mayor Gordon Oliver, charities claim. \n\n\n\nArticle: Cocker spaniel Daisy went missing from Upper Street, Hollingbourne, on Monday.\n\nHer owners, Pam, 77, and Bill Nash, 80, put out a Facebook appeal which has been shared 160,000 times.\n\nDog thefts have surged since the first coronavirus lockdown in March. Dogs Lost, the UK's largest lost and found dog service, has reported an increase of 250% in the past year, compared to the previous period.\n\nFemale dogs are often stolen to be used for breeding, but six-year-old Daisy was spayed when Mrs and Mrs Nash rescued her a year ago.\n\nDaisy got loose from the Nash's home on Monday. Within minutes Mr Nash went outside to fetch her, but she was already gone.\n\nMoments before, a witness with dashcam footage recorded Daisy two doors away from her home, near The Dirty Habit pub.\n\nA Kent Police spokesman said:\"It is alleged a man in a white flatbed truck stopped his vehicle and stole a white and tan cocker spaniel that was sitting outside an address.\n\n\"The truck then left the scene up Hollingbourne Hill towards Sittingbourne.\"\n\nMrs Nash's son-in-law Greg Mayes said:\"She is a part of the family.\"\n\nThe family is offering a reward to anyone who provides information leading to her safe return.\n\n\"Anybody could find her - or say they found her - and hand her in to the RSPCA, or call us, the police or Dog Lost anonymously,\"Mr Mayes said. \n\nKaren Harding from Dog Lost said 465 dogs were stolen in Britain last year, and 264 remain missing. She attributed the surge to lockdown and the subsequent high price of puppies.\n\nShe added:\"There seems to be an organised crime element involved and it is becoming increasingly more violent and threatening.\"\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

He was army commander-in-chief from 1984 until 1989 and was appointed prime minister of the interim military government in 1988. \n\nHe launched an unsuccessful\"liberation war\"against the presence of Syrian forces in 1989 and fled to France in 1990.

Twitter users sent 1.5m messages about the 3 April leaders' debate. \n\nThat's a big number - but still less than a fifth of the total number of people who watched the TV broadcast.\n\nSo has this been a\"social media election\"? When all the votes are tallied and the results have come in, here are the things to look out for in order to answer that question.\n\nDid social media mobilise the age group least likely to vote?\n\nWhen journalists talk about a\"social media election\"they tend to have one thing in mind - did something happen online which influenced voters and changed the course of the campaign?\n\nThere have been various attempts to create such a moment. One was Russell Brand's interview with Labour leader Ed Miliband, which has been watched more than 1m times on YouTube.  \n\nDavid Cameron was moved to respond to it - by saying he didn't have time to\"hang out\"with celebrities. And earlier this week Brand called on most voters to back Labour.\n\nThe Brand interview was far from the only such viral moment created by parties and their supporters. For example there were the competing #Milifandom and #Cameronettes hashtags... Nick Clegg's\"gangster\"fashion... and a host of celebrity memes, attacks and counterattacks.\n\nIf one thing unites all of these things it's their potential appeal to the age group least likely to vote.\n\n\"If turnout goes up among young people, it may be some indication that social media did play a part in the campaign,\"says Adam Parker, founder of the social media analytics platform Lissted. \n\nAccording to one survey taken before the election, a third of young people said that social media would influence their vote. \n\nWhat impact would that have? The conventional wisdom says that more young people voting would benefit Labour. But like everything else in this election, it's not that simple. \n\nCarl Miller, research director of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the think tank Demos, says voting patterns among young people - particularly first-time voters with no ballot box history to look back on - are becoming less predictable. \n\nUKIP has a highly organised social media campaign and the SNP, as we've reported before, punches well above its weight online. \n\n\"When 10,000 votes in a dozen swing marginal seats could dictate who the next prime minister is, of course social media could be decisive,\"says Miller. \n\n\"But so could television, or leafleting - this election is so close, anything could be decisive.\"\n\nThe social media numbers are huge - but that means very little\n\nThe numbers of people talking about the general election campaign online are greater than ever before - but of course, that's not surprising in a world where more people are online and than ever before. \n\nParty hashtags and leader names have been used millions of times, with almost 500,000 uses of one hashtag, #GE2015, just in the past week alone. \n\nParker warns against placing too much emphasis on raw numbers - such as the number of tweets using a particular leader's name.  \n\n\"There's a lot of nuance and complexity, more than ever before,\"he says.\"There are so many different issues, many of which go right down to the local level. How will the SNP influence Labour? How will UKIP impact Conservatives? Will Tories tactically vote Liberal Democrat in Sheffield? \n\n\"There are just so many different possibilities and issues. A number tells you nothing.\"\n\n\"The best way of looking at the effect of social media isn't actually looking at social media itself,\"says Miller.\"You really have to go back to conventional research.\"\n\nIt's only when follow-up surveys ask people questions such as whether social media made them more likely to vote, whether it influenced their vote or made them feel more engaged, that we'll have any real inkling if this was a\"social media election\"- no matter how many millions of tweets were sent.  \n\nDid social media mobilise political volunteers?\n\nOf course, journalists are hard-wired to look for moments and events - in other words, news. \n\nAnd a lot of attention has also been paid to how undecided voters might be swayed. \n\nBut there's a less obvious way in which social media is being used in this campaign - to rally the troops, organise volunteers and get out the vote. And again, because this election promises to be so close, those efforts might prove decisive.\n\nMiller says the parties have all pursued this strategy, and that they've taken a cue from US elections. The Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012\"showed that you could do that difficult alchemy of turning likes and tweets to volunteers, donations and votes,\"he says.\n\nFor example the the Conservatives'\"Team2015\"campaign has tried to mobilise supporters and reach beyond party members - to find more people willing to make donations or knock on doors. \n\nWill those efforts give the Tories an edge over the other parties, each with their own digitally assisted ground-game tactics? That's another key question that probably won't be answered on the night.\n\nWhy we might never know the answer\n\nOf course, it could be that the biggest impact is yet to come. During the television debates we saw claims and counterclaims washing across Twitter like so many waves on a very blustery beach. \n\nWith the polls predicting a close result and a high chance of negotiation and deals, the political messages being sent immediately after the polls close on Thursday will be key. \n\nIt's safe to assume that politicians, activists and meme-makers will be jockeying for position and the political tussle will continue on TV, radio, in newspapers - but most immediately, online.\n\nThere is no settled consensus on what strategies work online, as there is with other political tools such as polling and focus groups, Miller says. \n\nThat means that while, for instance, we know that the Conservatives have been spending a lot of money on Facebook, and UKIP's efforts have to some degree paid off online, the fine details of party social media strategy are still hard to come by and hard to measure. \n\nSo we might never know quite how influential social media was in shifting the outcome of Thursday's poll. \n\nElections are one-time events - they can't be rerun with the social media taken out. Without any hard proof either way it's probably folly to declare this a\"social media election\"(or the opposite). \n\nBut that won't stop pundits trying to do so after the contest is over - or even before. \n\nNext story: The Costco heir who became a voice for Baltimore\n\nFollow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.\nTL;DR: Commentators are already arguing about whether it was a \"social media election\" - but what does that term really mean?\n\nArticle: George Ferguson said the barrage would have a detrimental impact if trade at the port of Avonmouth is affected as a result of the proposed \u00a330bn project.\n\nHe has also opposed the Welsh government buying Cardiff Airport.\n\nCampaigners for the barrage claim it could provide 5% of the UK's electricity and create thousands of jobs.\n\nMr Ferguson told BBC Sunday Politics Wales he was worried the barrage would prevent or slow down ships entering Avonmouth.\n\nHe said:\"I think it's in the interest of the whole region that we have a successful port in the Severn of which our port on Avonmouth is a successful port. \n\n'Much better ways'\n\n\"It's as close to Wales as dammit and I think if the trade at that port is damaged it damages us all.\"\n\nMr Ferguson became Bristol's first directly-elected mayor last November. \n\nHe is an independent and he has responsibility for leading the council's services and its \u00a31bn-a-year turnover.\n\nHe said he did not see much economic or environmental benefit from a barrage.\n\n\"I think there are much better ways of using tidal and other forms of power in the Severn Estuary,\"he said.\n\n\"And there are much better ways in terms of the technology.

Suspected Ebola patients had previously been flown here from Sierra Leone and the team - who had been closely watching the news in China - had been preparing for this new, deadly and highly contagious virus.\n\nOn duty that night was senior sister Margaret Ward who took the call at four in the morning. Driving in, she wondered what she was about to face. \n\nThere had been a media blackout at the time and it was months before doctors told us about the patients; that they were relatively well and made a full recovery.\n\nBut this day marked the beginning of the UK's Covid story and, in the coming months, the early trickle turned into a flood of patients. Soon it was as if the infectious diseases unit took over the whole hospital - everyone was in PPE.\n\nITU was rapidly expanded and it has been able to take in Covid patients from not only across the region, but across England. The hospital has since treated more than 2,000 patients.\n\nNewcastle has also been at the centre of research into treatments for Covid, long-Covid and vaccines and, since that night of 31 January 2020, so much more has been learned about managing the virus.\n\nDr Price said:\"One of the things that we did, even before this pandemic, was to imagine what we would do if there was a pandemic.\n\n\"That helped us a little bit at the beginning.\"\n\nOne of the senior nurses now running the Centre for Life vaccination hub, Alison Heathcote, said the ward she normally works on was one of the first Covid wards.\n\n\"It was a really challenging and worrying time for everybody,\"she said.\n\n\"So, to get to this point and to have been involved with something that is hopefully going to have a major impact on moving us out of the pandemic it's really important to me.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

bishops, clergy and laity - but fell short by six votes in the House of Laity.\n\nThe result was greeted with emotion, with some supporters seen crying. \n\nBishop Welby, the current Bishop of Durham and a supporter of women bishops, tweeted overnight:\"Very grim day, most of all for women priests and supporters, need to surround all with prayer & love and co-operate with our healing God.\"\n\nThe outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Rowan Williams, who will give his farewell address later, spoke of his\"deep personal sadness\"after the vote.\n\nHe said:\"Of course I hoped and prayed that this particular business would be at another stage before I left, and... it is a personal sadness, a deep personal sadness that that is not the case.\"\n\nThe House of Bishops will meet from 08:30 GMT to\"consider the consequences of the vote\", the Church's media office said.\n\nThe general synod's voting requirements meant that although 324 members voted to approve the proposed legislation and 122 voted to reject it, it was not passed.\n\nThe House of Laity is the largest element of the general synod and is made up of lay members of the Church elected by its 44 dioceses. \n\nThe votes were 44 for and three against with two abstentions in the House of Bishops, 148 for and 45 against in the House of Clergy, and 132 for and 74 against in the House of Laity.\n\nControversy had centred on the provisions for parishes opposed to women bishops to request supervision by a stand-in male bishop.\n\nChristina Rees, a synod member who has spent 20 years campaigning for women bishops, said:\"It feels as if the House of Laity betrayed the entire Church of England last night.\n\n\"And I think basically that the people, the sort of extremes in our Church - the very conservative evangelicals and very traditionalist Anglo-Catholics - have no idea how this will be read by most people.\"\n\nShe said she thought that, to most people,\"this just looks like blatant discrimination\".\n\nEqualities minister Maria Miller said the vote outcome was\"very disappointing\", and showed that the Church was\"behind the times\", sources said.\n\nThe Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said those Church members who were in favour of women bishops, but who had voted against the move because of concerns over the provisions for traditionalist parishes, were central to finding a solution.\n\n\"There's a very big challenge, I think, to those who voted against but actually pledged themselves to see in what way they could move forward so that women can be bishops in the Church of England,\"he said.\n\n\"There's a very big responsibility on them and upon the bishops in their leadership to bring this into effect as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe Catholic Group on the General Synod, which backed a\"no\"vote, said in a statement:\"We regret the synod was put in the position whereby draft legislation failed at final approval because it was unclear and unfair in its provision for those who, in conscience, are unable to accept the ministry of women as bishops or priests.\"\n\nIt called on the House of Bishops to reconvene the talks started in the summer between representatives of different groups, chaired by Bishop Welby.\n\nThe Rev Prebendary Rod Thomas, chairman of the conservative evangelical grouping Reform, which also recommended a\"no\"vote, said:\"My overall conclusion is that it is very good news for the Church of England.\n\n\"We have avoided what could have been a disastrous mistake for our unity and witness.\"\n\nIn New Zealand, where women have been ordained as bishops for decades, the Bishop of Christchurch, the Rt Rev Victoria Matthews, described the decision as a\"product of fear\".\n\n\"I have to admit I was gutted by the announcement. I would describe it as more than disappointing.

There is a large amount of money on the table, there's been ample time for the companies and Unite to get their act together and sort it out.\"\n\nMr Hendy said:\"As I understand it, the bus companies made three offers to supplement this with more of their own money, but the Unite leadership have refused to budge from their position of \u00a3500 after tax for everybody, and indeed have asked for more during the course of the negotiations. \n\n\"The union leadership have also refused to defer the strike to give time for further negotiations or for any of the offers to be put to their members.\"\nTL;DR: Bus workers from 17 companies will go-ahead with a 24-hour strike in London despite an injunction, a union said.\n\nArticle: The head-on crash between a car and a van happened on the A142 Isle of Ely Way, Chatteris, in Cambridgeshire shortly after 20:00 BST on Thursday.\n\nRobert Bateman, 36, and his wife Paula, 35, from Manea, died at the scene.

This means there's also no agreed treatment.\"\n\nIt was not until a year-and-a-half after she was bitten that a test done by a laboratory in Germany confirmed she had Lyme disease.\n\nMs Lau has now welcomed the development of a new app in the Highlands mapping the occurrence of tick bites and the disease.\n\nScotland's Rural College (SRUC) is among Scottish organisations working on the technology backed by the European and UK space agencies, and aimed at mapping where the infection has been detected across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nLyme disease is an infection that can be spread to humans by ticks carrying the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria.\n\nDiagnosed cases of Lyme disease have reached an estimated 3,000 per year in the UK and more than 65,000 per year in Europe, according to SRUC. \n\nMs Lau was 30 and a business manager and make-up artist when she joined friends on the five-day camping trip on Loch Lomond.\n\nShe told BBC Scotland:\"On my hand I had a little black dot.\n\n\"I thought'aw, get this off me' and snapped the back of it off and left the head briefly in my hand.\n\n\"I just ignored it because I didn't realise it was a tick bite, or that it could lead to Lyme disease.\"\n\nLyme disease app\n\nA project to develop a new LymeApp has been launched at an event in Inverness.\n\nIt is being created to map where ticks bites and Lyme disease have been detected.\n\nThe app is being developed in a \u00a31.1m project aimed at providing information on the occurrence of ticks and Lyme disease across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIt will use satellite data and has received funding from the European and UK space agencies.\n\nThe app will draw on information from the Scottish Lyme Disease and Tick-borne Infections Reference Laboratory in Inverness, as well as information from general medical practitioners and those exposed to ticks through work or recreation. \n\nThe finished product is to have a function on the app which would allow people to report tick sightings and bites.\n\nA new company International Disease Mapping Apps Ltd, which involves SRUC, Highland Health Ventures Ltd, Environmental Research Group Ltd and Belgium-based firm Avia GIS NV, is developing the app.\n\nMorven-May MacCallum, whose life has been dominated by Lyme disease for nine years, was a guest speaker at the launch event. \n\nShe said:\"Lyme disease is an illness of unquestionable power and the damage it's had on my life and for thousands like me is immeasurable. \n\n\"It's wonderful to see professionals from across different areas of expertise come together to help advance our knowledge of this disease and, in the process, hopefully find the answers which are so desperately needed.\"\n\nA few days later Ms Lau noticed a circular bull's eye-like skin rash on her hand, but covered it with make-up unaware it was an early symptom of Lyme disease.\n\nFlu-like symptoms followed and then severe exhaustion.\n\nMs Lau said:\"I would fall asleep while driving and after I came home from work I would fall asleep at 6pm and wake up 12 hours later fully clothed and make-up still on.\"\n\nHer health continued to deteriorate to a point where she felt\"bone-crushing\"fatigue and was slurring her words. A concerned friend took her to Ms Lau's parents home.\n\nMs Lau said that before she fell ill she had been healthy, working a full-time job, going to the gym six times a week and enjoyed socialising with her friends.\n\n\"I was a 30-year-old girl living her best life and then all of a sudden six weeks later I had no energy,\"she said.\n\n\"I couldn't get out of my bed, I couldn't brush my teeth on my own. \n\n\"I've lost my job and my friends and living in seclusion in a bedroom in my parents' home.\"\n\nDoctors first diagnosed chronic fatigue disorder before Ms Lau was later told she may have a chronic pain disorder called fibromyalgia, whose sufferers include singer and actress Lady Gaga.\n\nHowever, after watching a documentary about Lady Gaga's battle with fibromyalgia Ms Lau said she knew something else was afflicting her.\n\nShe said:\"It took me two weeks to watch the documentary. I could only watch it for 10 minutes at a time before zapping out.\"\n\nMs Lau had been tested for Lyme disease and it had ruled it out. However, she said the test was not done for the bacteria spread by infected ticks. \n\nShe said the bacteria was only indentified in the test done by the German lab.\n\nMs Lau, who had the misfortune of later being bitten by a tick a second time while at a retreat in Crete during her recovery from the first bite, has welcomed the raising of awareness of tick bites and Lyme disease through the new app.\n\nThe infection can be treated with antibiotics within the first four weeks, and Ms Lau today spends every waking hour researching what treatments could help her now.\n\n\"It kills me every day to read on NHS websites that once bitten by a tick you can be given antibiotics within the first four weeks and that's it cured.\"\n\nLyme Disease\n\nSource: NHS Choices\nTL;DR: A woman went from living the \"best years of her life\" to almost two years of illness and seclusion in a bedroom because of a tick bite.\n\nArticle: The Acorn union said the extension, until 20 September, was\"not enough\"to prevent people becoming homeless.\n\nThere are fears thousands could lose their homes as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nProtestors took to the streets around England and Wales calling for more to be done to protect those who rent.\n\nMembers of Acorn, a community union which supports tenants in financial hardship, took part in socially distanced demonstrations in a series of cities.\n\nSam Rae, of Acorn Leeds, said:\"As soon as this extension ends, there'll be a tidal wave of evictions and that will cause a homelessness crisis.\"\n\nA survey by homelessness charity Shelter suggested that more than 170,000 private tenants have been threatened with eviction by their landlord or letting agent, and 230,000 in England have fallen into arrears since the pandemic started.\n\nCourts had been due to resume cases on Monday after a five-month pause but the delay has now been extended.\n\nAdvice for tenants\n\nSource: Citizens Advice \n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the\"11th-hour U-turn\"just gave\"renters a few more weeks to pack their bags\".\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was\"supporting renters over winter\"amid the ongoing fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHe added that, when the ban was lifted, the most serious cases of anti-social behaviour, other crimes, and unpaid rent for over a year would be heard first.\n\nLawyers and landlords' groups have said that, even after a ban expires, there is little expectation of people who have faced Covid-related financial problems being swiftly told to leave properties.\n\nThe National Residential Landlords Association, described the blanket extension as\"unacceptable\".\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

They are not fundamentally about making new discoveries.\"\n\nThe new Imperial concept comes amid renewed interest in the Red Planet with two private groups having proposed missions in recent months.\n\nThe Imperial team have designed a two-part craft, consisting of a Martian lander with a heat shield, inside which the crew would also ascend into Earth orbit. \n\nDirectly beneath the lander on the launch pad would be a\"cruise habitat vehicle\", a cylindrical craft split into three floors and measuring some 10m (30ft) in height and 4m in diameter.\n\nOnce in Earth orbit, the astronauts would move from the lander into the larger habitat vehicle before a rocket burst would propel the conjoined craft on a trajectory to Mars. The quickest journey time would be nine months when Earth and Mars are in optimum alignment. \n\nShortly into the journey, the lander and cruise vehicle would unwind from each other on a steel cable tether to a distance of some 60m. Short thruster bursts from both vehicles would then set them spinning around a centre of gravity.\n\nThis would create artificial gravity within the habitat vehicle similar to Earth's gravity, which the scientists believe would prevent the type of muscle and bone wastage that weightlessness would cause, which would render the astronauts unable to walk on Mars once they arrived.\n\nLater in the mission, the spin rate could be reduced to better emulate Martian conditions, where gravity is 40% that on Earth.\n\n\"We've obviously got some real issues with a long-term mission in terms of the de-conditioning which goes on in the space environment,\"Ryan Robinson, the Imperial team's physiologist, told BBC News.\n\n\"Bones loss [in a weightless environment] is about 1-2% a month and if they're landing they'll be susceptible to fractures if they've got to be exerting themselves.\"\n\nDuring the journey, the crew's health would be monitored closely with wireless sensors - but they would rely entirely on medication aboard the craft and the skills of their fellow crew members should they fall sick.\n\nThe long journey and confined quarters could also affect their mental health, and conflicts between the crew could arise.\n\nDuring the journey, the craft could deploy a number of measures to try to reduce the threat to the astronauts from solar and cosmic radiation, the former from the Sun, the later emanating from beyond our solar system.\n\nWater could run within the shell of the cruise craft to absorb radiation, while the Imperial team also examined the idea of fitting superconducting magnets to the craft, which would generate a magnetosphere to deflect solar and cosmic radiation in the way the Earth's natural magnetosphere does.\n\nThe crew would also deploy emergency procedures should satellites detect a major incoming solar flare. \n\nThis would involve winding in the tether and re-directing the lander's heat shield towards the Sun to protect the astronauts in the cruise craft. \n\nThe crew would also put whatever they could find between them and the front of the vehicle to absorb the solar burst.\n\nEven with such measures, a solar flare could still kill, or result in cancers. Cosmic radiation could also take its toll.\n\n\"We've got some great results from the Mars curiosity rover,\"said Imperial's Martin Archer, who specialises in solar and cosmic radiation.\n\n\"On its trip to Mars, it measured the radiation from these galactic cosmic rays and it was exposed to quite a lot - about two-thirds of the level that Nasa is prepared to risk over the whole of an astronaut's life, just on the way there and back again.\"\n\nOnce the craft reaches Martian orbit, it would contract together and the astronauts would pass into the lander ready for detachment and descent. \n\nIts shield would absorb the heat of entry before being jettisoned and then multiple parachutes would deploy to slow the craft, with thrusters used to further slow and guide it through the final metres to the landing site. \n\nThe Imperial team propose a landing site near the equator, where milder conditions exist. \n\nThey would hope to land near a pre-sent Martian habitat module and rover, although the rover could be robotically controlled to travel from the habitat to the landing site if the distance was too great for a crossing on foot. \n\nThen the Martian visit would begin - a first human landing on another planet.\n\nThe time spent on the Martian surface would be dictated by the next time Earth and Mars aligned for a speedy return home. It could be two months, or we might choose to spend more than two years on Mars, says the Imperial team. \n\nIt is during this time that the human crew could try to demonstrate why humans could still outperform robots in analysing and understanding the Martian environment.\n\n\"Some people think that the use of humans is just something that is popular and attractive from an adventure and inspirational point of view, but there are also real scientific benefits for sending humans,\"said Prof Mark Sephton, the team's geologist.\n\n\"Humans can data process while they're walking around, while they're looking at rocks. They're probably the most sophisticated computer, the most sophisticated robotic living organism that we can imagine.\"\n\nRadiation would remain a danger during the stay, with Mars possessing no magnetosphere to shield the surface from cosmic and solar rays. Shovelling up soil from the surface during the mission and part-burying the habitat module could help, as could staying inside during a solar burst.\n\nThen comes the return home, which would be far from simple.\n\nThe approach taken by the Imperial scientists would be to pre-send both the habitat module, rover and a return vehicle before any human launch. \n\nThe return vehicle would land at a latitude where water ice would be found in large amounts just a few centimetres beneath the surface. Robotic devices would mine the ice, which would then be split into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis. \n\nThese gases could be used as fuels on their own, or the hydrogen could be combined with carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere using a catalyst to produce methane, which is a more stable and energy-dense fuel than hydrogen. \n\nAs the Imperial team propose landing near the equator, a crew would have to travel by rover to a cooler latitude where the return vehicle and ice-mining devices would be waiting. Several hundreds of kilometres may have to be crossed, posing both risks and opportunities to further explore the Martian landscape. \n\nShould they make it safely, the crew would have a narrow launch window to ensure the quickest most fuel-efficient return to Earth.\n\nAfter leaving Mars, the return vehicle would dock with the orbiting cruise vehicle and replace the Martian lander as the counter-balance within the spinning tethered structure en route to Earth. Like the lander, the return vehicle would have to be fitted with a shield to protect the crew during extreme solar activity.\n\nAfter at least nine months, the craft would reach Earth orbit and dock with the International Space Station before the astronauts could take a Soyuz capsule home, the team envisages. \n\nThe new Imperial concept comes amid renewed interest in the Red Planet, with two private groups having proposed missions.\n\nBusinessman and former space tourist Dennis Tito wants to send an American couple on a mission beginning in 2018 that would pass within 100 miles (160km) of Mars before using the planet's gravity to\"slingshot\"the craft back to Earth.\n\nThe Dutch project Mars One proposes putting a human colony on the planet beginning in 2023, while SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk has spoken of sending a private human mission to Mars within 12-15 years.\n\nThe US, Russian, European and Chinese space agencies maintain long-term plans to put humans on Mars.\n\nThe documentary How to put a human on Mars can be seen this weekend on the BBC News channel and BBC World News.\nTL;DR: Scientists at Imperial College London have designed a concept mission to land astronauts on Mars.\n\nArticle: Stewart Cox said he was on his way to work when he saw 10 to 20 people\"with rucksacks\"run from the lorry towards the four cars on 11 October 2019.\n\nThe bodies of 39 Vietnamese people were found in a container on a nearby Essex industrial estate 12 days later.\n\nFour men are on trial at the Old Bailey in connection with the deaths.\n\nProsecutors have said the bodies of men, women and children, aged between 15 and 44, were found when the container was opened in Purfleet, Essex.\n\nTemperatures in the unit reached an\"unbearable\"38.5C as the Vietnamese nationals were sealed inside for at least 12 hours, jurors were told.\n\nGiving evidence, Mr Cox said he was trying to go to work at about 08:00 on Friday, 11 October 2019, but in the narrow lane in front of him was a lorry with a red-and-white cab, and four Mercedes cars which had just pulled up.\n\n\"I just see people getting out of the back of the lorry\u2026 with rucksacks\u2026 and just running towards the cars to get in the cars,\"he told the jury.\n\n\"After they disappeared the lorry, he was in a real hurry to get out.\n\n\"He pulled into the lorry park and then reversed.

it came third behind The Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats, with its share of the vote falling to 14%.\n\nAfterwards, several senior figures criticised a lack of clarity on Brexit, and last week, MPs expressed their frustration at a heated meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party.\n\nThe PLP is still split, though, with some MPs in Leave-supporting areas warning against backing a further public vote.  \n\nThe shadow cabinet was due to meet on Monday to discuss Brexit, but the meeting has been postponed.\n\nMr Watson -

That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it. \n\nWith technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast.  \n\nUnprecedented speed\n\nAt Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine.\"INO-4800\"- as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer.\n\nKate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said:\"Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours.\n\n\"Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to. \n\n\"We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms.\"\n\nInovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China\"by the end of the year\".\n\nIt is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation.\n\nThe last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over.\n\nThe timeline of 2019-nCoV\n\nThe work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world. \n\nIt was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases. \n\nDr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said:\"The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.\"\n\n'Molecular clamp'\n\nCepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus. \n\nThe University of Queensland is working on a\"molecular clamp\"vaccine, which it says\"enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens.\"\n\nModerna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research. \n\nThe WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi.\n\nAlthough efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting. \n\nThere are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China. \n\nAna Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said:\"We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first.\n\n\"The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses.\n\n\"Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak.\"\n\nThe WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days. \n\nInovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer.\n\nDr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said:\"This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible.\"\n\nLearn more about the new virus\nTL;DR: A deadly new virus.

with the rate for black African men almost five times higher than the rate for white British men.\n\nBut in the second wave, black people were not at higher risk of dying than white people, as they had been during the first wave.\n\nThe researchers said this showed\"ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 mortality can be addressed\".\n\nHowever, South Asian people had up to about a five-times greater risk of death with coronavirus compared with white British people - ranging from a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of dying for Pakistani men to 1.6 times higher for Indian women. \n\nThe findings were presented in a preprint but have not been formally published yet.\n\nA number of different factors have been suggested for why some ethnic groups have been hit harder than others by the pandemic:\n\nThese factors will be different for different groups - but they also appeared to change during the pandemic. \n\nDuring the first wave,\"geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in Covid-19 mortality,\"said the team, lead by Vah\u00e9 Nafilyan at the ONS and Nazrul Islam at the University of Oxford.\n\nIn other words, people from minority ethnic groups were more likely to live in areas harder hit by the virus.\n\nBut this was not the case in the second wave - and even after they adjusted for factors like health status, income and deprivation, the risk of dying of Covid remained\"substantially higher\"for people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds.\n\nThis suggested, the paper said, that\"focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in Covid-19 mortality.\"\n\nIt said\"a focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and a participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities.\"\nTL;DR: Black people in England have been no more likely than white people to die of Covid-19 in the second wave of the pandemic, official data shows.\n\nArticle: If the States agree there will now not be any changes to school subsidies until the 2012 financial year.\n\nIt was originally planned for the 50% reduction in the subsidy to take effect from 2011.\n\nSenator Perchard, an opponent of the proposal, has called for consultation to extend beyond time scales.\n\nThe council of ministers backed Deputy Reed's proposal to reduce the subsidy but wanted more time to ensure schools and parents are able to deal with the effects.\n\nDeputy Reed told BBC Jersey he would still be arguing in favour of the proposals.\n\nHe said:\"I said all along that the initial discussions have only just started and time needs to be allowed to develop the proposal further.\n\n\"It is also accepted that this particular proposal should be included in the 2012 business plan which would be subject to the approval of the States.\"\n\nPrivate sector\n\nSenator James Perchard, an opponent of the minister's proposals, said that he hoped the consultation would go beyond just looking at time scales for delivery.\n\nHe said in an e-mail to the council of ministers:\"I trust that\"by meaningful consultation\"the minister accepts that he must consult on the principle of, and the implications of, cutting the subsidy to fee paying schools, rather than just a time scale for the delivery of his flawed plan.\"\n\nSenator Perchard also wants the education minister to look at the wider\"inefficiencies\"in the States education provision.\n\nHe said:\"Given falling pupil numbers and the inefficiencies in the states provision, I believe this extended period of meaningful consolation will provide the minister with an opportunity to consider the closure of at least one primary school and one states secondary school.\n\n\"I believe that such an option would be the best way to raise the standards of education, to reduce the overall cost of education to the tax-payer, and increase the social mobility of our population.\"\nTL;DR: Jersey's education minister, Deputy James Reed, will give politicians and schools more time to discuss proposed subsidy cuts to fee-paying schools.\n\nArticle: The boys arrived by bus in Katsina, capital of the state of the same name, where they were met by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nLooking weary, some were still wearing their school uniforms, while others clutched grey blankets.\n\nState authorities now say the children were abducted by local bandits.\n\nJihadist militant group Boko Haram had claimed to have been behind the mass kidnapping but some experts were sceptical because it occurred well outside their normal area of operations.\n\nAccording to Governor Aminu Bello Masari, 344 boys were freed but others remain missing.\n\nThey were abducted on 11 December in an attack on a school in the town of Kankara.\n\nHow were the boys greeted?\n\nFlanked by armed police, the boys walked in single file from the buses to a government building to meet President Buhari and the governor. They were also due to undergo medical checks.\n\nParents were overjoyed to be reunited with their sons.\"I couldn't believe what I heard until neighbours came to inform me that it's true,\"one mother told Reuters news agency.\n\n\"I'm so excited,\"said another mother who been waiting anxiously with other parents after seeing her boy, 15.\"I have to cry, the cry of joy when I saw him,\"she told AFP news agency.\n\nOne boy told a TV station the group had been fed bread and cassava during their captivity and that it had been cold. He said he was\"really happy\"to be back in Katsina.\n\nAddressing the freed children, Governor Masari said:\"You suffered physically, mentally and psychologically, but let me assure you that we suffered more and your parents suffered more.\"\n\nEarlier he had told media:\"I think we have recovered most of the boys- it's not all of them.\"\n\nHow was the release secured?\n\nThe government insists no ransom was paid but that the boys were released after negotiations with the kidnappers.\n\nZamfara state governor Bello Matawalle, in whose state the boys were released, told the BBC that three separate negotiations had taken place before the students' freedom was secured.\n\nThey were released in Tsafe town in Zamfara on Thursday evening, authorities say.\n\nMr Matawalle told BBC Hausa that during the negotiations the kidnappers had raised various grievances.\n\n\"Among their complaints was how people kill their cattle and how various vigilante units disturb them,\"the governor said, adding that the government had promised to look into the complaints of the kidnappers.\n\nConflict between herders and farming communities are common in Nigeria's central and north-western states, says the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo in Lagos.\n\nBoth groups have been warring for decades but deadly clashes have increased in recent years as farming communities and herdsmen have employed armed vigilantes, especially in Nigeria's north-west.\n\nA spokesman for Governor Masari, Abdul Labaran, told the BBC the boys had been held by bandits.\n\n\"It wasn't Boko Haram,\"he said.\"The local bandits we know about all along were responsible. These are people we know very well, I met some of their leaders. That is why an umbrella body of cattle breeders' association was used in contacting them. So the negotiation was made through this umbrella body of cattle breeders.\"\n\nHow did the school attack unfold? \n\nWitnesses say armed men raided the school in Kankara last Friday evening. Many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots.\n\nSome were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once these students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men.\n\nOn Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appeared to be very young.\n\nOne of the boys said they had been taken captive by\"the gang of Abu Shekau\". Abubakar Shekau leads Boko Haram, a group notorious for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.\n\nThe name of the group, which is based in north-east Nigeria, loosely translates as\"Western education is forbidden\".\n\nArmed attacks and kidnappings are rife in the north-west and are often blamed on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area.\n\nAmnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice.\n\nYou may be interested in:\nTL;DR: More than 300 schoolboys have been reunited with their families, a week after they were kidnapped from their school in north-west Nigeria.\n\nArticle: By Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News \n\nBBC News has spoken to several research groups and small businesses who say they will soon have to scale down operations and lay off staff. \n\nSeven national academies have called on the government to ensure that research is protected in Brexit negotiations; the President of the Royal Society has told the BBC that the future prosperity of the UK is at stake.\n\nBritish universities, in collaboration with small businesses, receive \u00a3850m in research grants each year from the European Union. \n\nSince the vote to leave the European Union there have been reports that British applicants for grants are already losing out. \n\n'Frozen out'\n\nDr Nick Wright is one of the UK's brightest young astronomers at Keele University in Staffordshire.

A no-win dilemma where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  \n\nBut fewer people will have read the 1961 novel of the same name that propelled the phrase into the English language. \n\nCatch-22 was published 50 years ago. Written by Joseph Heller, it describes the wartime experiences of B-25 bombardier, Captain John Yossarian. Heller himself had served as a US Air Force bombardier in World War II. \n\nHe drags us through the muck and absurdity of a droll group of WWII airmen stationed on a small island off the coast of Tuscany - taking in the dark and brutal nature of war. In it hero Yossarian takes drastic measures to avoid flying an ever-increasingly required number of dangerous missions. \n\nThe only way to avoid such deadly assignments was to plead insanity, but to do so exposed a desire to live - a core aspect of the sane. \n\nPaul Bates, 42, understands Yossarian's plight. A lieutenant colonel with the British army's Royal Artillery regiment, he is currently working as the operations officer with the US Marine Corps in Afghanistan, he says Heller is spot-on in his depiction of this internal conflict.\n\n\"Many observers say that the character of conflict changes because of such things as technological advances. But the nature of conflict, the brutal, chaotic nature of it and the associated emotions - fear, exhilaration, anxiety, courage - remain the same. \n\n\"I see that in the book and have experienced it throughout my time in the Army. Yossarian was afraid of dying, so were many of his colleagues, and he was going to do everything in his power to try to prevent it from happening.\"\n\nYossarian, who of course was drafted into the war, takes drastic measures to avoid flying dangerous missions. These include poisoning the squadron, making up fictitious ailments to stay in hospital and moving the bomb line on the map during the\"Great Big Siege of Bologna\".\n\nLt Col Bates says other Catch-22 characters are just as recognisable.\n\n\"Others were fatalists. They say things like:'If you're destined to be killed over Bologna, then you're going to be killed, so you might just as well go out and die like a man.' Both of these approaches are ways to deal with fear of existing in a profession where you are trained to kill and might be killed yourself.\n\n\"I've seen them both on operations along with others, like the blase demeanour of Aarfy or Havermeyer's invincibility complex. I myself am a fatalist. If it's your time, it's your time.\"\n\n'Self-serving orders'\n\nLt Col Bates also sees similarities in frustrations surrounding the military's hierarchical organisation, which gives rise to comic, inept characters in command positions such as Cathcart, Dreedle and Peckem.\n\nThere is a quote in the book:\"Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three.\" It sums up a character who was unjustly promoted to the rank of major, on account of his birth name.\n\n\"By virtue of their appointment alone and their position in the chain of command, they are allowed to get away with enforcing outrageous self-serving orders that those below are powerless to resist for fear of extreme military punishment,\"says Col Bates.\n\nHeller wrote of the combat men in the squadron being\"bullied, insulted, harassed and shoved about all day long by one after the other\", unable to object to orders.\n\nIn Catch-22, for those lower down the food chain, there is nowhere to go to question methods. The same can be true today mainly because the army employs the same top-down reporting system that was in place 70 years ago, says Lt Col Bates.\n\n\"This is where the military finds itself in a Catch-22. It needs to adopt a strict hierarchical system in order to fulfil its mission. There is little time for debate in a conflict situation. And yet this system can give birth to both brilliance and toxicity.\"\n\nWhen the book was published in 1961, reviews were polarised, ranging from\"the best novel in years\"to\"disorganised, unreadable, and crass\". Views still are. \n\nRex Temple, a retired US Air Force senior master sergeant, says he a hard time reading Heller's comical depiction of life in the armed forces. He found it hard relating to the characters, their actions and their relationships. \n\n\"Perhaps I am a bit biased because I served 28 years in a more mature and reformed service. Even past discussions with World War II veterans did not reveal anything like that portrayed in Catch-22.\n\n\"Our current military is much more disciplined and respectful than the characters portrayed by Heller. There really is no comparison to the current tours in Afghanistan or Iraq.\"\n\nAlthough he did find one similarity - field mice in the tents.\n\nInsanity and absurdity\n\n\"Except [now] an individual would be court-martialled if they used their government-issued weapons to kill rodents inside. Generally, it is forbidden to eat food inside because the falling crumbs attract insects, which attract lizards or mice,\"he says.\n\nDr Roy Heidicker, 4th Fighter wing historian based at the US Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, says those who serve are too busy with their duties to appreciate the irony of their circumstances. \n\nDuring his time serving in the US Marine Corps, Dr Heidicker acted as battery supply officer, just like the outrageous Milo Minderbinder - Heller's mess officer who runs an international black-market syndicate.  \n\nHe pursues profit unscrupulously, but insists that\"everyone has a share\"in the syndicate. A classic interaction has Minderbinder looking to trick Yossarian into eating, and enjoying, chocolate-covered cotton, as he desperately tries to find a way to feed the men his latest acquisition, seeds and all.\n\n\"Milo would have been proud of me as I developed my own'everybody wins' method of doing business,\"says Heidicker. \n\n\"If battalion supply didn't have it, chances were I did.

We're talking, as we often talk, about houses - the impossibility, in this expensive corner of Sussex, of finding a home you can actually afford. Rents around here, even for the smallest two-bedroom house, average \u00a31,000 a month or more. In my case, as a self-employed single parent with two small children, every penny, and many a sleepless night, are spent keeping a roof over our heads.\n\nMy friend mentions some houses that a man left for low-income families to rent for three years at \u00a3300 a month. \n\nWe remark on the good humans; how stories like this are something we need to hear more and more. Later, scrolling through the shouty soapbox noise of Twitter, I decide to share this nugget of niceness. I don't expect anyone to respond - I don't use hashtags or copy anyone in. My normal tweets about Virginia Woolf and geeky lit events get barely a scattering of likes. I write:\n\nJust heard about a guy who died in my village + left 3 houses to the council, with the stipulation that they're for young families to rent for a fixed period of 3yrs with rent of \u00a3300 pcm (in an area where rent is \u00a31000+). Because we all need to talk more about the good humans.\n\nTalking about the good humans is something I feel we definitely all need to do. Especially on Twitter. But I had no idea how much Twitter agreed.\n\nI wake up the next morning to 5,000 likes. The rest of the day, my phone explodes, until I have to turn notifications off. I watch the number rise hypnotically, swiping down on my screen to see the tally go up, 100 more at each refresh. Night falls with 41K likes, 8,000 retweets and nearly 200 comments.\n\nThe comments seem to fall into three categories:\n\n1)   People praising this stranger's random act of kindness (\"give him a sainthood\"), thanking me for sharing good news, pleased there's goodness in the world.\n\n2)  People who think I've made it up (\"I'm filing this under things that didn't happen\") - a few put me forward for @DHOTYA, the Didn't Happen of the Year Awards.\n\n3)   Cynics, sceptical about the council (\"Three lucky council officials\") or about the capitalist system (\"Three houses? He's the problem\"/\"How much was he charging when he was alive though?\"). Also random racists:\"They will give it to immigrants\"/\"The Somalis will be grateful.\"\n\nSomething which began as a local anecdote has suddenly become a story I have to prove. I find myself in the uncomfortable grey zone where something becomes\"true\"through popularity not fact. Despite having presented it purely as something I'd\"heard\", I feel compelled to uncover the truth as I watch comment after comment deride the landlord's kindness with cynicism.\n\nOther comments spur me on, such as:\"This man deserves a plaque memorialising his contribution\"and\"Shame you don't mention the benefactor's name so they can be acknowledged for this great act of kindness and generosity.\"\n\nSo I start asking around the village. I speak to the parish council, to the village history group, to people walking on the green. And the stories I discover reveal even more kindness than I expected.\n\nSt Mary's Church, Ringmer, 2014\n\nApril, four years ago, the village church. People of all ages and backgrounds have come to celebrate the life of a remarkable man. Ian Askew, 92 - Army captain and Military Cross winner, High Sheriff of Sussex, joint master of the Southdown Hunt, antiques dealer, churchgoer, star of many a local pantomime, philanthropist. A good-humoured, high-spirited bachelor, for whom his community became his family, dishing out money, often anonymously, to local groups and individuals in need.\n\n\"Ian could mix with everybody,\"recalls one local.\"He was well-known as someone who would talk with anyone, often popping into coffee mornings at the village hall and chatting with older residents. He had strong relationships with all his tenants, never raising rents or throwing anyone out. There are still people living on the old controlled rents on his estate.\"\n\nAskew lived alone in nearby Wellingham House but, finding it bigger than he needed, he let a charity have it for a peppercorn rent, and it became a home for people with learning difficulties.\n\nThe more I hear, the more I realise that Ian Askew may have died in 2014, but in the gifts he leaves behind he very much lives on.\n\nThe Brickworks, The Broyle, Ringmer, 1970\n\nThe stories take me further back still, to 1970, a few fields away from the church, where a large Victorian brickworks is making its final bricks. For nearly 200 years, a brickworks has stood here. The village, rich in Weald clay, has been renowned for its pottery since the Norman conquest - there are remains of medieval kilns scattered all over these fields. Bricks from this brickyard built every house on the pre-war Nevill estate in nearby Lewes. The clay pond will one day become part of an animal rescue centre, housing ducks that my children and I will spend many afternoons feeding.\n\nThe Bentley Estate, 1970\n\nNot far over the fields, in the sprawling Bentley estate, a man called Gerald Askew is taking his final breaths. Gerald is Ian Askew's brother. Between them, they own much of the area: Plashett Wood, where my children will, years later, go to forest school; Wellingham House, next door to my children's future nursery; Bentley, where we will go for my son's second birthday. They also own the brickworks. But now Gerald is dying, the kilns have stopped firing, and soon Ian Askew will come up with a plan for the brickyard house.\n\nThe Jubilee Cottages, 1977\n\nIan turns the house into two semi-detached cottages, to be let to young couples while they wait for years on the council housing list. He calls them the Jubilee Cottages, to mark the Queen's 1977 Silver Jubilee. He has seen the difficulties faced by families in need as they languish on the waiting list, and he wants to help them, by allowing them to rent his houses for the same price as a council house (then \u00a3100 or so per month) until they reach the top of the list. The cottages are managed by the district council until all housing stock is sold off. They are then placed into a protected trust, managed, to this day, by Ringmer parish council.\n\nContrary to Twitter's cynical assumption that the houses would be sold, rented out at an inflated price or reserved for council officials and their relatives, Askew's intention has in fact been honoured for four decades, and that shows no signs of changing. The houses are now rented out for three years, not two, as they were in the past, and though the rent appears to have tripled to \u00a3300 it has actually halved in real terms. Families apply to the parish, outlining their circumstances and their connection to the area. Many use the opportunity to save up for a deposit to get a foot on the precarious housing ladder.\n\nAs I try to find past tenants to speak to about the cottages, I am surprised to discover I recognise one of the names - a family I met in a swimming class years ago when we had babies of the same age. I ask them what the Jubilee tenancy meant to them.\n\n\"We were so grateful for the cottage and the generosity of the Askew family and the parish. It enabled us to start our married life without the strain of money worries, staying close to our families in an otherwise unaffordable location. Being at Jubilee enabled us to start our own business, as well as prepare for a family of our own, saving for a deposit for our first home where we now live. None of that would have been possible without this legacy.\"\n\nI visit the cottages. They are beautiful and remote, surrounded by fields and fresh air. Children's toys fill the garden. Above the front door, a stone is engraved with the details of Askew's gift and the date, 1977. These are sturdy family homes, built to last. A place that once made bricks is now helping young families save for bricks of their own.\n\nWhat would happen to people if they couldn't live here? They'd be forced to move 20 miles away or more. As the local housing office told me a few years ago:\"We simply can't house people in Lewes. You have to go further afield.\"\n\nAt a time when private accommodation is unstable and expensive, and public housing barely exists, it's comforting to think that part of the gap is being filled in these informal, compassionate ways. Some of the Twitter comments highlight similar acts of philanthropy around the UK. More good humans, whom we should talk about. As someone says on Twitter,\"Was this in the news? It should be everywhere. Might encourage others to do the same.\"Another comment hopes Askew might\"start a new trend\".\n\nAt present, there are so many gaps that people fall through. A young person tells me on Twitter: As a person at risk of homelessness, I applaud this man. There aren't enough houses. Though I am top priority, if the houses are not there, my choice is a B&B in the city which means a 2hr school run everyday, the streets, or living with my abusers.\n\nThe more I look, the more I discover that Ringmer is the village that kindness built. Ian Askew's gift here is not the only legacy of its kind, with some acts of philanthropy going back hundreds of years. In 1787, Miss Henrietta Hay left \u00a32,000 to be invested, the interest paid to elderly people in need in the parish in the form of small pensions. Her wishes have been carried out for over 200 years, with local residents receiving windfalls every year just before Christmas. Going further back still, to the 1690s, Dame Barbara Thomas and Sybilla Stapley bequeathed \u00a3200 to pay the salary of a schoolmaster at Ringmer Charity School. Teachers' salaries may have changed in the last 300 years, but the endowment still exists, donations still being made to support the village school. And Ian Askew's legacy lives on beyond Jubilee Cottages. His Charitable Fund still supports charities and organisations across Sussex.\n\nEvery Wednesday evening, as I put my children to bed, I hear the bellringers practising in the village church. I draw great comfort from it. I get chatting to a man who tells me that, a few weeks after Ian Askew's death, the bellringers marked what would have been his 93rd birthday - 9 May 2014 - by playing a\"Plain Bob Minor\".\n\nI wouldn't have been listening then. I would've been in my old house, frustratedly searching for somewhere to live, to build a new life. Typing in criteria like\"garden\"and\"two bedrooms\", when all the while I should have been typing:\"A place that cares enough for bellringers to mark the birthday of a late good human.\"\n\nBut of course there's no tickbox for such things. No compassion-o-meter to measure the small moments, tiny acts, tender stories and kind people sewn into the fabric of your area. The people who check in on sick neighbours or get groceries for the elderly, who lend you the pound for your shopping trolley, who help you get on to the bus with your pushchair, who smile at you warmly for no reason at all, who clear the snow from your winter path. In this case, the man who goes to coffee mornings, church services and village meetings, always listening out to hear what people need, then quietly making anonymous donations. \n\nWe don't always know what we really want when we are trying to make a home. For the people on Ian Askew's list for the Jubilee Cottages, it's clear though that they want somewhere safe for three years while they get themselves sorted. Where they won't be randomly evicted when the landlord sells, or ups the rent. Where they can feel some of the goodness that may have eluded them until signing that lease.\n\nCompared with the beautiful, chocolate-box villages around here, Ringmer is often seen as a budget suburb of Lewes, a concrete splodge in the South Downs. Outsiders rarely see beyond the centre of the village: chippy, offie, Dominos, McColls. Funeral parlour, pet shop. A shop that keeps changing - tanning salon, nail bar, dance studio, now empty. You have to dig a bit deeper to discover the independent bakery that bakes the best bread; the tiny public library, shut down this year by the council, only to be reopened as a community library by a tenacious group of locals; the community orchard full of local varieties of apples, pears and plums, planted on land donated by a local farmer and run by passionate volunteers. \n\nWhen I moved with my children into our Ringmer home, I wasn't looking for a community, and until now I didn't know I had one. But a random tweet has connected me to a village built on compassion and stories. A place of good humans.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTheo had just turned 17 when he became homeless.

She felt compelled to check it out.\n\nArticle: By Neil PriorBBC News\n\nYet six months before John Frost's last stand - 175 years ago this week - the seeds had been sown around a hundred miles away, in the Powys town of Llanidloes.\n\nWhat started out as a peaceful protest for universal voting rights for men on 30 April 1839 ended up with a Chartist mob seizing control of Llanidloes for five days.\n\nSelf-employed weavers in Llanidloes's flannel industry were being put out of work by mechanised factories, and at the same time prices were rising. \n\nAs only 3% of the town were able to vote, the workers turned to peaceful protest to raise their issues.\n\nOstensibly the riot began when constables drafted in from London arrested three Chartist ringleaders - Abraham Owen, Lewis Humphreys and Thomas Jerman - and imprisoned them in the town's Trewythen Arms hotel.\n\nAn angry crowd overpowered guards, sacked the hotel and freed the three men. \n\nBut as Pam Smith, curator of Llanidloes Museum explains, all wasn't necessarily as it seemed.\n\n\"A local landowner, TE Marsh, had drafted over a hundred special constables from amongst his reluctant tenants, effectively pitting neighbour against neighbour,\"she said.  \n\n\"Some sources say that when it looked as though this was going to backfire on him, it was Marsh himself who threw the first stone and started the riot, so he could escape to Shrewsbury and raise the alarm. \n\n\"You have to remember that for some the French Revolution was still in living memory, and the ruling classes were petrified at the potential for the same thing to happen here.\"\n\nIt took until 4 May for soldiers to arrive and restore order. \n\nOutside the town,\"wanted\"posters were put up offering rewards for the capture of the three escaped men and other known Chartist leaders.\n\nBut with Mr Marsh and his constables ejected from Llanidloes, inside the atmosphere was said to have been good-natured and festive.\n\nThe period was named the\"Five Days of Freedom\", and a mould was even cast to strike coins for an independent Llanidloes. \n\nHowever, when the troops did eventually arrive, they met very little resistance.\n\nMs Smith said:\"I think even the most ambitious Chartists knew that they'd never be able to hold Llanidloes for very long, so by the time the soldiers entered the town the feeling seems to have been that the protest had already made its point and there was nothing to be gained from a pitched battle they couldn't win.\"\n\nThirty three people, three of them women, were either imprisoned or transported to Australia in the months which followed.\n\nTwo of the ringleaders - Abraham Owen and Lewis Humphreys - were among those captured and sent Down Under.\n\nBut the third - Thomas Jerman - escaped via Liverpool to America where he settled and had a family, fighting in the American Civil War of the 1860s for the North.  \n\nA military garrison remained in Llanidloes for the next year, though there was never a repeat of the disturbances.\n\nWhilst on the face of it little had been achieved, the uprising could be seen as paving the way for the more famous, and ultimately more successful, Chartist protests.\nTL;DR: Mention Chartism in Wales, and most people would immediately think of the Newport Uprising of November 1839.\n\nArticle: More than \u00a33m of public funding to 118 bus routes in Oxfordshire could end as the local authority tries to cut its transport budget by \u00a36.3m. \n\nCouncillor David Nimmo Smith said:\"We don't like having to do this, but it is an economic necessity.\"\n\nMartin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport called it a\"dark day for bus passengers in Oxfordshire\". \n\nHe added:\"The county council's bus cuts are by far the largest announced this year, and many of the services and routes which now face the axe will in effect mean the end of public transport altogether for thousands of local people.\"\n\nThe council said it may review the extent of the cuts in the new year if its budget settlement from central government is better than expected.\n\nMr Nimmo Smith said:\"We've based our proposals today on what we think the worst-case scenario is and that will mean we're going to have to remove subsidies on all the subsidised buses and to restructure dial-a-ride.\n\n\"If the settlement is better than we're expecting it will allow us to put money back into the service, which means not all the bus subsidies will go.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we know we're not going to have enough money to save all the subsidies which means we are going to have to prioritise.\"\nTL;DR: All subsidies to commercial bus companies in Oxfordshire face being scrapped, the county council has said.\n\nArticle: They were found in a drainage ditch on Oristown bog, near Kells, by contractors called in to prepare the site for forensic excavations.\n\nThe land is being examined in the search for the remains of Belfast man Brendan Megraw.\n\nHe was one of the 16 murder victims that became known as the Disappeared.\n\nEarlier, a representative of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme it was acting on information received from Sinn F\u00e9in. \n\nLater, the commission said it wanted to make it clear that the information came from a long-standing republican contact.\n\nMembers of Mr Megraw's family visited the site on Wednesday.\n\nHis brother, Sean, said the remains would not be removed until Thursday, but he hoped his brother could soon be laid to rest with their father and mother.\n\n\"I'm sad, but there's relief that apparently it is Brendan - we can't be 100% but we're fairly sure it is him,\"he said.\n\n\"From what we've been told and where he is etc, it looks like it is Brendan.\n\n\"It was a shock this morning. I knew they were about to start searching and it was more or less while they were doing some preparatory work that incidentally they found his remains.\"\n\nHe said it could be weeks before the remains are formally identified.\n\nMr Megraw was 23 when he was abducted from Twinbrook in Belfast in 1978, and murdered by the IRA. \n\nThe IRA claimed that he had confessed to being a British provocateur and Military Reaction Force undercover agent.\n\nSean Megraw said for the first 20 years after his brother's disappearance the family had no idea what had happened to him.\n\n\"It was only since 1999 that we knew for definite that he had been killed, but prior to that you were nearly afraid to talk to people,\"he said.\n\nInvestigators from the ICLVR - set up by the British and Irish governments to liaise with former paramilitaries to find the Disappeared - confirmed a body was being recovered on Wednesday.\n\nGeoff Knupfer, a lead forensic investigator with the ICLVR, said the team had been clearing out drains when they unearthed remains.\n\nAnalysis: Chris Buckler, BBC Ireland correspondent\n\nDark mounds of earth sit in piles on top of the bogland where the body was discovered.\n\nIt was found during work ahead of a concentrated search. But the diggers lie idle either side of a police forensic tent.\n\nThere is a simple police cordon on the old road that leads into the bog  but the flat land stretches out in every direction.\n\nIt is an obvious reminder of the scale of all of these searches for the Disappeared.\n\nTheir bodies were never meant to be found. Republican paramilitaries buried their remains in remote areas to try to hide their crimes.\n\nThat left families always wondering, always questioning what had happened to their loved one.\n\nFor years, some even held out the hope that they might still be alive.\n\nIt is likely to be days before the body found in Oristown is identified but Brendan Megraw's relatives are praying their long hunt to find him is finally over.\n\nIt is important to remember they are not the only family still waiting to be able to hold a proper burial for people who were taken from them during the brutal decades of Northern Ireland's Troubles.\n\n\"A microscopic search of the ground will be taking place to ensure nothing is left to chance,\"he said.\n\nThe state pathologist is to begin the process of a post-mortem examination and formal identification.\n\nMr Knupfer told Talkback the commission had received fresh information from Sinn F\u00e9in in the summer of this year and as a result, a fresh dig for Mr Megraw had been getting under way.\n\nHowever,  Mr Knupfer said that he was\"not at liberty\"to go into the details of that information.\n\nEarlier, another of Brendan Megraw's brothers, Kieran, said the family had mixed feelings.\n\n\"We still have to get confirmation that it is actually Brendan, but it's within the area that they were going to start searching, so you have to be hopeful,\"he said.\n\n\"It's a joy that a body has been found, but (there's) also a sense of sadness too.\"\n\nThere have been three unsuccessful searches for Mr Megraw, the most recent in 2010.\n\nIn August, the ICLVR announced that a new search for Mr Megraw would get under way.\n\nThey said that a\"geophysical survey\"would be carried out on 2.5 hectares of land.\nTL;DR: Human remains have been found in County Meath by a team searching for an IRA victim missing for almost 40 years.\n\nArticle: The prop - made from fibreglass and wood - is believed to have been used in the 1971 film Lust for a Vampire.\n\nIt went under the hammer at Moore Allen and Innocent in Cirencester.\n\nAuctioneer Philip Allwood said it was quite a\"statement piece\"and had been sold to local buyer. Ahead of the sale he said he was hoping it would\"appeal to the vampire market\".\n\n\"But unfortunately the auction is during the day and they don't tend to come out in daylight,\"he added.\n\nMr Allwood said the prop had come from a private client who had bought it at an auction of film memorabilia in Tewkesbury in the early 1990s.\n\nHe said film buffs in the online community had helped to identify it as being from the 1971 film.\n\nHammer became known for its gothic horror films, from the mid-1950s to the 1970s, featuring iconic characters such as Frankenstein's monster, Dracula and the Mummy.\nTL;DR: A gothic tomb used as a classic 1970s Hammer Horror film prop has been sold at auction for \u00a3440.\n\nArticle: Their union, Unite, said it had tried many times to discuss grievances with the bus company.\n\nBut LibertyBus, which runs the island bus service, called Unite's attitude\"astonishing\"and said it had never been approached to discuss shifts.\n\nUnion representatives and the operator are to meet on Thursday.

The UK decided unilaterally and autonomously to withdraw from the EU. This implies leaving its programmes as well.\"\n\nEU rules mean the UK and its companies cannot participate in the\"development of security sensitive matters\", he said, adding that this did not mean the UK could not use an encrypted signal from the system as a third country.\n\nEarlier Science Minister Sam Gyimah said the EU's position was\"extremely disappointing\".\n\n\"The EU is playing hard ball with us,\"he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"We have helped to develop the Galileo system.

The hashtag #plantsofinstagram has been used more than 4 million times.  \n\nPlant miles\n\nWith the craze has sprung up a number of specialist online retailers that deliver straight to your door.\n\nPatch, which says it is London's biggest online plant retailer, is one example. It gives its plants nicknames like\"Chaz\"and\"Big Ken\"to endear them to prospective\"plant parents\".\n\nChief executive Freddie Blackett says that part of the appeal is that plants make people feel\"calmer, happier and more at ease\".\n\nPatch's plants are grown in the Netherlands and shipped to the UK as and when they are ordered, which avoids excess plants being shipped.\n\nBut ordering online could rack up\"plant miles\", says Fay Kenworthy, co-founder of PlantSwap, a Sheffield-based community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally.\n\n\"As many plants are brought in from overseas, their transportation represents a significant ecological footprint,\"she says, noting that while most come from Holland, orchids can be shipped from Indonesia and\"light-loving\"plants from Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\n\"You may have decided to reduce your international travel to protect the environment but your plants are still shipping across the world.\"\n\nShipping from abroad isn't too much of a concern for botanist and BBC presenter James Wong, the proud owner of 500 houseplants.\n\n\"You're going to be [ordering plants] on a much smaller scale compared to outdoors, so, by definition, it's going to have a lower carbon footprint,\"he says.\n\nHe argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car, and that many UK buyers live closer to Amsterdam than British-based suppliers.\n\nHe adds that growing certain plants in hotter climates and shipping them to the UK can eliminate the need for heated greenhouses closer to home. \n\nHowever, Wong agrees that exchanging unwanted plants, cuttings, and seedlings at plant swaps is a sustainable option for houseplant buyers.\n\nAnother benefit, according to Ms Kenworthy, is that it avoids the excess packaging that comes with new plants - including plastic pots.\n\nPlastic pots\n\nPots can be a\"nightmare\"to recycle, says anti-plastic campaigner Amy Meek, 16.\n\nOnly about 10% of local authorities in the UK accept them, according to analysts at the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). \n\nSometimes they are not collected because they are considered contaminated. But many are also made from black plastic, which often cannot be detected by sorting machines at recycling centres, and so end up in landfill or incinerated.\n\nMany local authorities reject even non-black plastic pots, which has led to the development of more easily-recyclable taupe pots and even biodegradable pots.\n\nThe Horticultural Trades Association and RHS Gardens offer plant pot recycling or\"take back\"schemes, and B&Q says it is trialling a recycling scheme.\n\nMiss Meek, who runs environmental charity Kids Against Plastic with her younger sister, Ella, wants buyers to think about plants' packaging.\n\nShe encourages people to ask:\"Will I be able to  I use it again, or is there somewhere else I could look to buy these plants from that are using more sustainable packaging or one that could be used for longer?\"\n\nFor peat's sake\n\nBut being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered  - it is also about what it is grown in. \n\nThe main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts. \n\nThe earthy substance, found in waterlogged areas in the UK, is made of decomposed plant matter and can take thousands of years to form. \n\n\"Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year,\"says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife.\n\nHe encourages people to check with retailers about the use of peat, or to stick to plants that don't need it, like orchids or cacti.\n\nBut hang on, don't houseplants clean the air?\n\nBecause plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air.\n\nPhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove\"significant amounts\"of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil.\n\n\"The amount the plant is watered affects its ability to function and remove CO2, in the same way as with people - if you're dehydrated or have drunk too much water you will not function as well,\"he says.\n\nDracaena\"Golden Coast\"plants and peace lillies performed best in his research, but he says you'd still need to buy a lot of them - even installing a vertical garden or\"green wall\"- and have extra lighting in order for them to reduce CO2 levels.\n\nSo, are houseplants bad for the environment?\n\nWong says that everything we do has a carbon footprint and that, in the scheme of things, people shouldn't\"freak out\"about their environmental impact.\n\nHowever, he advises that if buyers want to be as sustainable as possible, they should talk to their suppliers about the use of peat, avoid buying houseplants that are\"designed to die\"like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti, and propagate plants from cuttings and seeds to offset any environmental concerns.\n\n\"Not that those things are a huge issue,\"he says.\"But every little bit helps.\"\nTL;DR: Cultivating an indoor plant is thought to have positive effects on mental health and wellbeing, and a snap of a succulent is a sure way to get some Instagram likes.

Gill Dummigan, BBC North West health correspondent\n\nA&E departments can be seen as a barometer which measures pressure levels in the NHS as a whole.\n\nFor relatively minor and many chronic conditions, the best place for patients to be seen is their local general practice.\n\nBut if it is full, and it's nigh-on impossible to get an appointment, the temptation to head straight to A&E is there.\n\nWe also have a rapidly ageing population, and it is a depressing fact of life that as we get older we tend to need more healthcare.\n\nAnd when they're ready to come out of hospital, there is often a lack of support in the community.\n\nThis means there are fewer beds available on general wards and, in turn, patients remain longer in A&E beds.\n\nThis slows down the\"throughput\"of patients, if you like.\n\nUntil we find a system of better caring for older people, future crises within A&E units are likely.\n\nA spokesman for NHS England said the region's hospitals\"were under significant pressure\"with\"prolonged bad weather, high levels of respiratory illness, flu cases and a rise in the severity of illness among patients arriving at A&Es\". \n\n\"The NHS National Emergency Pressures Panel... acted promptly to help hospitals free up beds and staff to be able to care for the sickest patients\", he said, adding that more A&E patients were treated\"within four hours compared with the previous year\".\nTL;DR: Hospitals in the North West of England were placed on the highest level of alert 32 times during the winter of 2017-18, the BBC has learned.\n\nArticle: The leading pro-Leave campaigner and Tory leader frontrunner said the 52-48 result was\"not entirely overwhelming\".\n\nSetting out his post referendum vision in the Daily Telegraph, he said the UK could reform its immigration system and keep access to the single market.\n\nBut ex-chancellor Alistair Darling accused him of treating the situation\"like a big game\".\n\nThursday's EU referendum, which has triggered a Conservative leadership contest and mass resignations from Labour's front bench, followed a bitter four-month campaign with recriminations continuing over the weekend.\n\n\"We who are part of this narrow majority must do everything we can to reassure the Remainers,\"wrote Mr Johnson, who has kept a low profile since the result was announced.\n\n\"We must reach out, we must heal, we must build bridges -

Of course these cables are unconfirmed and it is very difficult for outside people to comment on it.\n\n\"But it does seem to suggest that some of the origins of the political problems in Thailand over the last few years are somehow connected to this worry about what will happen to the monarchy.\n\nDr Forsyth said some people in Thailand had told him that the 2006 coup which sought to depose Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister took place partly because they were worried about the relationship between him and members of the royal family. \n\n\"This might suggest,\"Dr Forsyth said,\"that this underlying uncertainty about the royal family might be part of the political problems going on in Thailand over the last few years, such as the riots in Bangkok earlier this year.\"\n\nThere has been no comment so far from those cited in the leaked US cable, including the crown prince.\n\nThani Thongpakdi, foreign ministry spokesman, said:\"Regarding documents that have been released by Wikileaks in general, Thailand is not in a position to confirm the accuracy or authenticity of such documents because they were not issued by us. \n\n\"Additionally many documents seem to be conveying hearsay or gossip which in some circumstances may have been reported out of context.

which accounts for more than 90% of the country's export revenues.\n\nAs prices tumbled in the past months - from $115 (\u00a369) a barrel in June 2014 to below $50 last month - the country's GDP took a nosedive.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the economy will contract 10% this year and a further 6% in 2016.\n\nPresident Maduro has been pressing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) - of which Venezuela is a member - to decrease production and push barrel prices up to at least $88.\n\nHowever, most Opec countries are interested in maintaining prices relatively low, so as to disincentive shale-gas projects.\n\nCaracas is bracing itself for oil prices to stay low. \n\nLast week, the National Assembly approved the 2016 budget which predicts a price of $40 per barrel next year.\n\nShortages and queues\n\nFor the past two years, going to supermarkets in Venezuela has been a time-consuming affair.\n\nA study by polling firm Datanalisis suggests that Venezuelans spend on average five hours per week buying groceries and visit up to four different stores to find products.\n\nOutside each major store, there are long queues and it takes hours for customers to get inside.\n\nChronic shortages of a number of products mean many have to go home empty-handed. \n\nThe hardest items to get hold of are the 42 staples the prices of which the government controls. Among them are milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil.\n\nMoreover, the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimates that there is a shortage of 70% of medication in most pharmacies across the country.\n\nFood companies complain that with regulated prices, some items are just not profitable to produce. \n\nThe government accuses producers of deliberately stockpiling products in order to drive prices up.\n\nVenezuelan-based broadcaster Telesur recently alleged that the shortages were a\"concerted effort by the opposition to create psychological distress in the country ahead of elections\".\n\nInflation\n\nWith shortages and queues, prices for essential goods are skyrocketing in the black market, driving up the cost of living.\n\nThe IMF predicts annual inflation of 159% in Venezuela this year - the highest in any country in the world. In 2016 it could be upwards of 200%, according to the Fund.\n\nVenezuela has not released any official inflation data this year, but President Maduro recently stated that figure for 2015 was likely to be 85%.\n\nThe government tries to tackle rising inflation with price controls; recently it fixed the price for a carton of 30 eggs at 420 bolivares.\n\nBut not all sellers stick to the fixed prices. Consumers reported paying almost three times as much on the black market, according to Huevo Today (Egg Today), a Twitter account on which Venezuelans share information on the prices of eggs.\n\nExchange rate\n\nVenezuela has three official exchange rates and an illegal black market rate.\n\nThe first two are used for importing goods which the government considers essential, such as food, medicine or household items. The third one is for Venezuelans who do not have the authorisation to buy dollars at the preferential rates.\n\nBut the black market rate is the one which many Venezuelans use as it is hard to get approval to exchange money at the official rates.\n\nThe disparity between the first rate and that of the black market is enormous. One dollar will buy you 6.3 bolivares at the lowest official rate, while on the black market it will fetch a whopping 800 bolivares, according to the widely used website DolarToday.com website. \n\nThe government introduced currency controls in 2003 to stem the flow of capital out of the country, but instead they have been a driving factor in pushing up inflation.\n\nImporting goods can be prohibitively expensive and companies are forced to find local alternatives.\n\nFor 10 months, fast food chain McDonald's replaced its French fries with yuka fries - made with local cassava - because importing potatoes had become too dear.\n\nFrench fries only returned to its menu last month when McDonald's finally managed to source potatoes locally.\n\nLiving standard\n\nOne of the proudest achievements of Chavismo - as the politics of the late President Hugo Chavez and his successor in office Mr Maduro are known - is its record in reducing poverty and inequality.\n\nPoverty levels were halved between 2003 to 2011 and Venezuela's Gini co-efficient, which measures inequality, improved greatly.\n\nSocial programmes sponsored by the government helped boost real income, but many fear that in a recession some of those gains are at risk of being reversed.\n\nA recent study by three Venezuelans universities suggested that poverty had already increased massively. The study suggested 73% of the population now lived in poverty - up from 27% in 2013.\n\nThe government dismissed the study, saying that not only had poverty not risen but that extreme poverty had fallen in 2015. \n\nOfficials also said that unemployment had fallen to a historic low of 6.7%.\nTL;DR: Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday to elect all 167 members of the National Assembly amid tension caused by the country's worsening economic decline.\n\nArticle: Linda YuehChief business correspondent\n\nWhere they've delivered more is by putting issues such as climate change in the message from world leaders. Those weren't on the formal agenda as the host, Australian PM Tony Abbott, had nixed climate change, for one. \n\nBut, after US President Obama mentioned the urgency of dealing with climate change at a speech in Brisbane before the summit, it's unsurprising that it was discussed after all. \n\nEbola is also in the final statement. \n\nSo, the G20 didn't just focus on the purely economic issues. I wrote before about how most of these issues are linked to the world economy in any case.\n\nBut, where they have delivered less is with respect to concrete commitments on those issues. \n\nFor instance, the gist of the G20 statement on climate and Ebola is that they are concerned, and support effective action - without committing money or quantitative targets. Maybe that's too much to expect given that these originally weren't on the agenda.\n\nFighting tax evasion was on the agenda, and the G20 agreed to automatically share tax information, but I've already heard criticism from Transparency International and others that it doesn't go far enough because the information won't be in the public domain.\n\nGoing for growth\n\nOf course, economic growth was top of the agenda, and is, as expected, the main focus of the G20 statement.\n\nWorld leaders reaffirmed their goal of lifting the GDP of G20 economies - which represent 85% of the world's economy - by an additional 2% within four years, by 2018. It's equivalent to adding $2 trillion to global output, and they say that will create millions of jobs. \n\nHow they can achieve that, of course, is the big question.\n\nThe statement says that they'll deliver jobs through increasing\"investment, trade and competition\". \n\nEach country will have their own plans, but the mechanisms outlined include getting another 100 million women into the workforce, increasing trade, and setting up a Global Infrastructure Hub. \n\nWhat is notable is a focus on youth unemployment, with details to come next year. They also emphasised a commitment to poverty eradication and reducing inequality, which are certainly important.\n\nWho's paying is, of course, key. \n\nMy understanding is that private businesses are being targeted for investment funds in infrastructure, for instance. We'll see more detail soon enough when individual countries work through their country plans in the coming months.\n\nJobless recovery\n\nRaising global growth by 2% has been an aim of the G20 all year, and in prior years in various forms, yet the eurozone economy is teetering and emerging markets such as China and Brazil have been slowing. So, another statement may ring a bit hollow. \n\nOn the other hand, it's unclear what co-ordinated action could be taken since it's not 2008/09 where governments and central banks were jointly acting to save the global financial system. \n\nI'm told that countries will monitor each other's actions to ensure that there's no negative impact on others. That may be what's realistic, but also it is also unsatisfying to those who have been waiting for their governments to do more jointly to create jobs.\n\nAfter all, how to address the so-called jobless recovery, where output has recovered but employment has not, is a key issue in a number of major economies. Perhaps when the G20's employment working group reports back in 2015, there will be more detail.\n\nHowever, if it takes until November in 2015 at the G20 in Turkey to see specific policies to address the jobless recovery that has been with us for more than six years, taxpayers may begin to balk at paying for these big summits that promise much but tend to deliver somewhat less.\nTL;DR: The G20 summit of world leaders has concluded with a communique, a fancy way of describing a joint statement, that has both delivered more, but also somewhat less, than expected.\n\nArticle: By Rachael GarsideBBC News\n\nThe UK's oil and gas industry is warning 30,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the coronavirus pandemic with oil prices at their lowest in 20 years.\n\nThat has seen bills for houses heated by oil fall by as much as 75%.\n\nHowever there are concerns that those customers storing additional cheap fuel could be targeted by thieves.\n\nAbout 1.5 million homes in the UK use heating oil, including nearly 114,000 in Wales. The majority of those are across rural areas where houses are not connected to the mains gas supply.\n\nThey are being urged by industry experts to take advantage of prices falling from 54p per litre in January to below 20p in recent weeks.\n\nSuppliers say some customers are even buying extra tanks to be able to store the cheap fuel.\n\nCertas, the largest heating oil supplier in mid and west Wales, said demand had increased significantly.\n\n\"Fuel, and heating oil in particular, is one of the highest expenditures for anybody throughout the year,\"said commercial manager Andrew Cooper.\n\n\"Normally at this time of year a lot of customers top up their tanks, but at the moment they are filling up completely.\"\n\nMr Cooper, based in St Clears, Carmarthenshire, said some customers were anticipating a 75% saving on heating.\n\n\"It's refreshing in uncertain and difficult times that there is some positive news,\"he added.\n\n\"I would certainly fill up the tanks, but ensure the security measures are in place. With everybody buying fuel, there is the threat of theft with people knowing they are full.\"\n\nQuad Fuels, based in Wrexham, said the price fall was a\"small positive in difficult times\"and predicted it would be\"several months\"until the markets fully recover.\n\nHowever managing director Anthony Saunders predicted a slump in business later in the year with so many customers stocking up now.\n\nShould I stock-up?\n\nMalcolm Farrow of the industry body the Oil Firing Technical Association (Oftec), said this was a\"really good time for customers\"with prices so low.\n\nHe predicted a\"small rebound\"in prices over the coming months though prices would remain relatively low for a while.\n\n\"If you can afford it, do it now, and you'll get an incredibly good deal, but if you can't it's probably not the end of the world and you will still probably find that prices are pretty low even if they have crept up a little.\"\n\nWhat will happen when prices rise again?\n\nLloyd Thomas runs a fuel club in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, which buys oil every months for its 200 members collectively, to save money.\n\nApril's order was \u00a31,200 cheaper than March - but Mr Thomas is worried prices could rise just as fast as the lockdown eases.       \n\n\"I'm very concerned... where will the prices end up after this?\"he asked.\n\n\"They're starting to creep back up now in the last month. For older people, it's hard - we're still in poverty - there's a lot of people who can't afford it as it is.\" \n\nWhat about petrol for my car?\n\nPetrol prices have also fallen during the crisis, but not as significantly because of taxation levels. \n\nA litre of unleaded petrol has gone down from from 127p in January to 107p, according to UK government figures. \n\nHowever the AA has claimed motorists are being ripped off by petrol companies not passing on cheaper oil prices at the pump.\n\nWhat about liquid petroleum gas (LPG) users?\n\nPrices are lower but users of LPG central heating - delivered to tanks or in bottles - have not benefitted as much from cheaper crude oil either.\n\n\"It's because they are locked into longer-term contracts,\"said Mr Farrow of Oftec.\n\n\"As they renew their contracts, they'll get a better deal if the LPG suppliers think prices are likely to stay low for a period.\n\n\"But with LPG, particularly if you've got a larger tank, it's usually owned by the supplier, so changing supplier is not quite so straightforward.\"\n\nWill it affect jobs?\n\nValero insists it is business as usual at its Pembrokeshire oil refinery, which employs about 1,200 workers, despite the global crash in demand for fuel - particularly from motorists and the airline industry.\n\nA spokesperson said:\"While we have previously shared that some of our gasoline-producing units have been temporarily idled, the guidance we provided for second quarter 2020 is our system running at about 70% capacity. We are not considering employee layoffs or furloughs.\"\n\nWhat's the long-term outlook?\n\nThe oil industry is having to wait for the outcome of the pandemic on the economy like everyone else.\n\nCarol Bell, an oil industry expert, said storage was the immediate issue facing refineries with tankers holding crude oil having to sit offshore from ports, waiting for demand to pick up. \n\nHowever the industry was already facing questions amid the climate change debate.\n\n\"There was already a global conversation about the future of oil, as concern grows about climate change,\"said Dr Bell.\n\n\"Add to that, the fact that many businesses have discovered during the pandemic that many of their staff can work from home, and you can see a situation where the demand for fuel could continue to be lower than pre-pandemic levels and decline over the longer term.\"\nTL;DR: The dramatic fall in oil prices may be bad news for the industry - but is providing a brief windfall for households fuelled by heating oil.\n\nArticle: The victim, who was reportedly shot in the leg, was taken to hospital on Thursday evening for non life-threatening injuries.\n\nNottinghamshire Police stopped and searched eight people in the St Ann's area but no weapons were found. \n\nThe 21-year-old is being held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.\n\nThe latest incident in Lotus Close, off Hungerhill Road, follows three shootings in June, in nearby Radford and Old Basford. \n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

What is clear, however, is that police let this belief go unchallenged.\"\n\nIn 2008, the Police Ombudsman's office commissioned a Home Office pathologist to reassess all the available material. \n\nHe concluded on the basis of some of the injuries that the bomb was placed outside an inner door and therefore outside the bar. \n\n'Ridiculous'\n\nThis was similar to the findings of a forensic scientist who examined the scene of the blast the day after the explosion.\n\n\n\nPatrick McGurk, whose father, Patrick, was the bar owner, lost his mother, Philomena, who was 46 and his sister, Maria, who was 14 years old, in the bombing.\n\nHe said the ombudsman's report could not go unchallenged.\n\n\"My initial view is that it smacks of the police trying to absolve themselves of all responsibility for any wrong doing or incompetence,\"he said.\n\nHe described the report's conclusion saying that\"on the balance of probabilities\"the police conducted a\"reasonably thorough investigation\"as\"patently ridiculous\".\n\nMr McGurk said the facts pointed to the\"distinct possibility that the police investigation had not been thorough\".\n\n\"Is it not the case that, if the police jumped to an early conclusion about an IRA home goal, surely then,'on the balance of probabilities' the police cannot have investigated thoroughly the possibility that it was a loyalist attack,\"he said.\n\nA spokesman for the Police Ombudsman said:\"We acknowledge that some of the families appear to have difficulties with parts of our report and we will of course arrange to meet them very soon to discuss these.\"\nTL;DR: There is no evidence police colluded with the loyalist killers behind one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles, the Police Ombudsman has found.\n\nArticle: Video footage showed Mark Davies confronting a group of saboteurs at a New Year's Day hunt last year in Barlow, Derbyshire.\n\nOn Wednesday he was found not guilty at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.\n\nMr Davies, 67, said he planned to submit complaints to Derbyshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nThe footage of the scuffle, one of three videos shown in court, showed Mr Davies approaching Austin Jordan with his arms out after the four hunt saboteurs, dressed in black, were told to leave.\n\nSlightly off camera they made contact and Mr Davies, chairman of the hunt, ended up on the floor. He then got up and tackled William Robinson, a second hunt saboteur.\n\nInitially, Mr Davies, from Sheffield, complained to police that he had been assaulted but he ended up facing two charges of assault by beating.\n\nMr Davies argued he was\"fearful\"for himself and his wife - a retired superintendant for South Yorkshire Police - and acted in self defence. \n\nBut the prosecution alleged Mr Davies had been the aggressor and was partly motivated by a dislike for hunt saboteurs. \n\nMr Davies described hunt saboteurs in court as\"anarchists\"and\"class warriors\"with\"no interest in animals\". \n\nDistrict Judge Andrew Davison concluded there was not enough evidence to find Mr Davies guilty of assaulting and beating Mr Jordan.\n\nOn the second charge concerning Mr Robinson, he noted Mr Robinson was moving away with arms outstretched when Mr Davies tackled him.\n\nBut he accepted Mr Davies honestly believed he was defending himself with reasonable force and found him not guilty. \n\nAfter the trial, Mr Davies said he planned to lodge a formal complaint with Derbyshire Police's chief constable and the Director of Public Prosecutions. \n\nMr Davies said he continued to believe he was the victim, although no charges have been brought.\n\nHe said:\"Derbyshire Constabulary and the CPS should hold their heads in shame.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police said the force had not yet received his complaint and would consider it when it did.\n\nA spokesman for the CPS said prosecutors did not decide a person's guilt but made\"fair, independent and objective assessments\"about whether there was enough evidence to take a case to court.\n\nHe added:\"The decision to prosecute this case was made on the basis of the evidence provided to us, including video footage of the incident which we showed to the court during proceedings.\"\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

a global business that he described as\"opaque\".\n\nHe added the government had to ensure any money provided stayed in the UK.\n\nSpeaking to MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) Committee, the business secretary conceded that Liberty formed an important part of the supply chain, but insisted it would be\"irresponsible to give money to an opaque group with assets around the world we haven't got to the bottom of\".\n\nIn terms of contingency plans for keeping Liberty Steel going, Mr Kwarteng said it was necessary to work through GFG (Gupta Family Group) chairman Sanjeev Gupta's plans for refinancing his business, and examine what the local management planned to do, before considering intervention by the government. \n\nAsked what would happen if the business were to collapse, he stressed that the government would stand behind Liberty's workers and local management, but could not give any guarantees.\n\nMr Kwarteng was also asked whether he had received any approaches from former prime minister David Cameron on behalf of Greensill Capital. He said he had\"never received a single phone call or Whatsapp message from David Cameron\", and nor had any of his officials, as far as he knew.\n\nThe business secretary also insisted there had been no pressure placed on the British Business Bank (BBB) by ministers or officials.\n\nThe BBB had approved Greensill as an accredited lender that could hand out emergency Covid loans early last year - a move that GFG benefitted from.

90% of referrals are from the NHS.\n\nPatients are supposed to be admitted to these assessment and treatment units (ATUs) for nine to 18 months but the average stay nationally is five years. \n\nChief executive Katie Fisher told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme one patient had been detained for an extra 524 days after they should have been released. \n\n\"It varies over time and of course the reasons for delays are complex,\"she said.\n\n\"This isn't someone sitting on something, who isn't doing their job properly.\n\n\"Maybe several attempts have been made to create a discharge and for several reasons that has fallen through.\"\n\nExtreme distress\n\nLast month, the programme reported that one St Andrew's Healthcare patient, Ayla Haines 26, had tried to kill herself after spending seven years in an ATU. \n\nFollowing this, Labour's shadow care minister, Barbara Keeley, announced an all-party parliamentary group to investigate mental health hospitals.\n\nOn Monday, research by the children's commissioner for England found too many children were being admitted to mental health hospitals unnecessarily - despite a government pledge to move up to 50% of such patients into community settings by March 2019. \n\nMs Fisher said continuing to detain patients who no longer needed to be in ATUs was unacceptable,\n\n\"But actually, people's mental health and wellbeing can fluctuate over time, so it's not as simple as just saying someone needs to be here and someone doesn't need to be here.\"\n\nHospitals use a seclusion room as a last resort if a patient is in extreme distress or is a risk to themselves or a member of staff.\n\nIn a damning report published this week, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) called for a review of every patient in long-term seclusion or segregation in mental health hospitals across the UK. \n\nThe Victoria Derbyshire programme was given footage of a teenager reaching their arm through a door hatch to enable contact with their parents during a visit to a St Andrew's hospital. \n\nThe parent told the programme the patient had been held in seclusion for months.\n\nLow-stimulation rooms\n\nA recent CQC inspection of St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton found one patient had had repeated and prolonged periods of seclusion over 18 months.\n\nThe hospital said it would not comment on individual cases.\n\nBut Ms Fisher said:\"In some seclusion rooms for certain types of patients, there is the opportunity to for food and other things that patient might need to be given to them through an opening of the door, which means the door itself doesn't have to be opened. \n\n\"The use of seclusion rooms is only ever used as an emergency response and if all other efforts of de-escalation, both verbal and low-stimulation rooms, have failed.\"\n\nAnother CQC inspection report, published in 2016, found a technique called prone - or face-down - restraint was being used widely across wards at the St Andrew's hospitals.\n\nIts use has reduced - but there were still more than 1,000 recorded incidents last year. \n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, prone restraint was used by staff on patients 5,597 times.\n\nReducing numbers\n\nThis is despite a consultant psychiatrist at St Andrews telling the Victoria Derbyshire programme prone restraint should not be used. \n\n\"It is something that is associated with death in some circumstances - certainly within the charity, we have reduced the amount of prone restraint that we use drastically over many years,\"said Paul Wallang.\n\nBut he added:\"Sometimes when somebody is restrained they will move into the restraint position in a prone. \n\n\"If that happens, we immediately move them to supine, which is face-up, a much safer way to restrain - and all of our staff are trained in that technique.\"\n\nA government spokeswoman said:\"The NHS is committed to reducing numbers of people with a learning disability and autistic people who are inpatients in mental health hospitals by 35% by the end of March 2020.\n\n\"And through the [NHS] Long Term Plan, we will reduce numbers even further by investing in specialist services and community crisis care and giving local areas greater control of their budgets to reduce avoidable admissions and enable shorter lengths of stay.\n\n\"The CQC is also undertaking an in-depth review into the use of seclusion, segregation and restraint - which should only be used as a last resort - in order to improve standards across the system.\"\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.\nTL;DR: Up to 50 patients, some with learning disabilities and autism who should be released, are stuck in secure units run by a mental health hospital charity.\n\nArticle: The US soldier then known as Pte First Class Bradley Manning lip-synced to Lady Gaga while downloading thousands of classified documents from military servers, according to a computer hacker she befriended.\n\nThe 29-year-old is six years into what would have been a 35-year sentence, after being convicted of 20 charges in connection with the leaks, including espionage. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy.\n\nAfter her sentencing, Pte Manning, who was born a man, said she wanted to live as a woman and had taken the name Chelsea.\n\nHer time in prison has seen her engage in a fight with the army over receiving gender reassignment surgery, a fight that also saw her attempt to take her own life.\n\nIn November, she urged then-President Obama to reduce the remainder of her sentence to the six years she has already served. She said she took\"full and complete responsibility\"for her actions, and was not asking for a pardon.\n\nThree days before he left office, he granted her wish.\n\n'Funny little character'\n\nAs an intelligence analyst in the US Army, Pte Manning was given access to a large amount of highly sensitive information.\n\nBut as a private first class, she was very low-ranking with a relatively meagre wage.\n\nAccording to her friends, she had become frustrated with a military career that appeared to be stagnating.\n\nAnd her personal life appears to have hit a downward spiral after she was posted to Iraq in 2009.\n\nPte Manning joined the army in 2007 after drifting through low-paid jobs.\n\nBorn in December 1987, she was brought up in Crescent, a small town in Oklahoma. Her father, Brian, reportedly spent five years in the military.\n\nBut her parents divorced when she was a teenager, and she moved with her mother to Haverfordwest in south-west Wales.\n\nAs a teenager, she was said to have been a hothead who was often teased for being a geek.\n\nA friend from Wales, James Kirkpatrick, told the BBC she was a\"funny little character, really on the ball\"who was obsessed with computers.\n\nAfter finishing school, she returned to the US and joined the army. Friends say she enlisted to help pay for college, and she later said she had joined up in the hope the army would rid her of her desire to be a woman.\n\nShe was deployed to Iraq in October 2009. But messages she posted on Facebook suggest she was far from happy.\n\nShe wrote in early May 2010 on the site that she was\"beyond frustrated with people and society at large\".\n\nA week earlier, she had written:\"Bradley Manning is now left with the sinking feeling that he doesn't have anything left.\"\n\nSome of the postings appear to refer to a recent breakdown of a relationship.\n\nBut weeks later her words appeared prophetic when she was arrested by military investigators on suspicion of stealing secret information.\n\nSelf-confessed computer hacker Adrian Lamo told the world's media how Pte Manning had admitted the data theft during conversations they had on the internet.\n\n\"Listened and lip-synced to Lady Gaga's Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history,\"Pte Manning wrote, according to a transcript of their messages published on Wired's website.\n\n\"Weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis\u2026 a perfect storm.\"\n\nMr Lamo went to the authorities with the messages.\n\nDuring a sentencing hearing at her court martial in August 2013, a military psychiatrist testified that Pte Manning had struggled with her gender identity and wanted to become a woman.\n\nIn March 2011, the US Army charged Pte Manning with 22 counts relating to the unauthorised possession and distribution of more than 720,000 secret diplomatic and military documents.\n\nAmong the files she passed to Wikileaks was video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007.\n\nWikileaks released tens of thousands of documents relating to the Afghan war. \n\nThe website later disclosed thousands of sensitive messages written by US diplomats and military records from the Iraq war, causing growing embarrassment to the US government.\n\nPte Manning told the court she had leaked the documents to spark a public debate in the US about the role of the military and about US foreign policy.\n\nAt a later sentencing hearing, she apologised for\"hurting the US\"and said she had mistakenly believed she could\"change the world for the better\".\n\n'I am Chelsea Manning'\n\nA day after she was sentenced to 35 years in prison, Pte Manning said she wanted to live as a woman.\n\n\"I am Chelsea Manning,\"she said in statement to NBC's Today programme.\"I am a female.\"\n\nShe said she had felt female since childhood, wanted at once to begin hormone therapy, and wished to be addressed as Chelsea.\n\nIn 2014, a military judge granted Manning's official name change from\"Bradley Edward Manning\"to\"Chelsea Elizabeth Manning\"and she was later approved for hormone therapy.\n\nShe tried twice to take her own life during her time at Leavenworth prison in Kansas. It was later reported this was because of her ongoing fight for gender reassignment surgery. \n\nHer lawyer also said she had spent long stretches in solitary confinement. \n\nIn 2016, she went on hunger strike, before bringing it to an end after the army agreed to provide her with the surgery.\n\nDuring her time in prison, the US Department of Defense lifted a longstanding ban against transgender men and women serving openly in the military.\n\nManning is expected to complete her gender transition after her release.\nTL;DR: During his final days in office, US President Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who was found guilty of leaking US army documents.

Possible reforms to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act in England and Wales. \n\nNow, for the first time, MPs have formally debated the issue in Parliament. \n\nAnd it's in Parliament where a decision will eventually be made on what to do next.\n\nThe government has been consulting on whether the current system, whereby someone can legally change their gender, is too clinical, bureaucratic and intrusive. \n\nThe answer from some is an emphatic yes. The leading LGBT campaign group Stonewall is among those calling for a simpler, more streamlined process.\n\nThe Scottish government has also said it is committed to reform and has just published some analysis following its own consultation. \n\nTo change a birth certificate a person currently has to:\n\nBut there are those with deep concerns - including numerous feminist and women's groups who say they feel vilified and marginalised in this debate. \n\nAnd in a Westminster Hall debate this week, the Conservative MP David TC Davies suggested that the potential reforms might mean\"a 15-stone bearded man could simply define themselves as female and there would be nothing anybody could do to object to this\". \n\nHe said that, being a\"libertarian\", this wasn't necessarily a problem in itself. \n\nBut the issue, for some, arises out of a fear that by making it easier to redefine a person's gender, it will be easier to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and even women's refuges.  \n\nAnd that there might be people who will do so for nefarious purposes.\n\nBut Mr Davies struck a lonely figure around the debating table as MPs from Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats opposed him. \n\nAmong them, Layla Moran (Liberal Democrat) said that a\"moral panic\"had been\"whipped up to demonise a community\". She said there was nothing to suggest that a person would soon be able to switch genders\"on a whim\"one afternoon.\n\nWe will have to wait to see what the government's proposals are before it is clear how far the reforms might go. \n\nIt is worth noting that the 2010 Equality Act protects trans people from discrimination, meaning that someone who identifies as a woman can already access female-only spaces.\n\nHowever, the same legislation also allows services, such as domestic abuse shelters, to exercise a level of discretion on who can access those services.\n\nBut the case of Karen White, a transgender prisoner who sexually assaulted fellow inmates, is being frequently cited as an example of how the law is already letting women down. \n\nThis week, Women's Minister Victoria Atkins blamed\"a series of terrible failings that should never have happened\". She said that the Ministry of Justice is reviewing the case as well as the wider protocols in place.\n\nThe government is expected to announce its next steps on the Gender Recognition Act in spring 2019, once officials have gone through over 100,000 consultation responses. \n\nVictoria Atkins emphasised that no decisions have yet been made. But it's clear that the government is inclined towards reform, mindful of its pledge to help improve the lives of LGBT people and tackle transphobia. \n\nAny changes will need to go through Parliament, which means this week's Westminster Hall discussion could end up being considerably amplified once it hits the Commons floor where there are currently no trans MPs.\n\nLaw can underpin culture and culture will influence law. Here a question about birth certificates has been absorbed into a much broader, and contentious, discussion about what it means to be a woman.\n\nIt poses a difficult question: by enhancing the rights of one community, do you diminish the rights of another? \n\nThere will be those who say that is totally false premise; that trans rights and women's rights are not in conflict. \n\nBut the fact that conflict exists on this issue is undeniable and it looks like Parliament will soon have to fully enter the fray.\nTL;DR: A debate on trans and women's rights is raging in the LGBT and feminist communities.\n\nArticle: Officials faced a barrage of hard questions covering why they would not release data and what they were doing to prevent future abuse.\n\nThey insisted the Church had learnt from the crisis and had taken action to prevent future abuse.\n\nVictims' advocates complained there was still too little transparency. \n\nLast month, the Vatican refused a request from the UN's Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) for data on abuse, on the grounds that it only released such information if requested to do so by another country as part of legal proceedings. \n\nThe Vatican came to Geneva expecting a rough ride and it got one, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports. \n\nVictims say they hope the hearing, which is being broadcast live, will prompt the Church to end its\"secrecy\".\n\nPope Francis announced last month that a Vatican committee would be set up to fight sexual abuse of children in the Church. \n\nThe Holy See is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, a legally binding instrument which commits it to protecting and nurturing the most vulnerable in society.\n\nIt ratified the convention in 1990 but after an implementation report in 1994 it did not submit any progress reports until 2012, following revelations of child sex abuse in Europe and beyond.\n\nIn a homily on Thursday, Pope Francis said abuse scandals were\"the shame of the Church\". \n\n'Not very transparent'\n\n\"The view of committee is that the best way to prevent abuses is to reveal old ones - openness instead of sweeping offences under the carpet,\"Kirsten Sandberg, chairwoman of the 18-strong CRC, told the Vatican delegation.\n\n\"It seems to date your procedures are not very transparent.\"\n\nThe Vatican was asked why it continued to describe abuse as an offence against morals rather than a crime against children. \n\n\"Does the Holy See believe that paedophilia is something that can be successfully overcome?\"was another question.\n\nArchbishop Silvano Tomasi said:\"To prevent abuse of minors is a real, immediate concern.\"\n\nOn prosecution of offenders, he said priests were\"not functionaries of the Vatican but citizens of their countries and fall under the jurisdiction of their own countries\".\n\nWhen asked if the Vatican would hand over Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, a Polish papal envoy recalled from the Dominican Republic in September amid claims of sexual abuse there, Archbishop Tomasi said he was being investigated by the Vatican's own prosecutors.\n\nA member of the CRC asked about the Church's practice of moving priests suspected of abuse.  \n\n\"It is a no-go simply to move people from one diocese to another,\"said Bishop Charles Scicluna, the Vatican's former chief prosecutor of clerical sexual abuse. \n\nHe insisted it was\"not the policy of the Holy See to encourage cover-ups\"but added:\"The Holy See gets it that there are things that need to be done differently.\"\n\n'Refused to answer'\n\nWhile Thursday's questions were numerous and far-ranging, some observers vented frustration at the lack of specific answers.\n\n\"Holy See:'We get it' in UN review on child sexual abuse Catholic Church,\"wrote the children's rights watchdog CRIN in a tweet.\"Do you? Why then don't you make statistics public?\"\n\nBarbara Blaine, president of a group representing US victims of abuse by priests, told BBC News that the hearing had brought\"hope to victims across the globe\".\n\nBut it would also stand, she said, as a\"record of how the Church officials refused to answer the questions, how they claim to be open and transparent, and yet they don't live up to that ideal\".\nTL;DR: The Vatican has been confronted publicly for the first time over the sexual abuse of children by clergy, at a UN hearing in Geneva.\n\nArticle: Formally called the Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks - a reference to George Floyd, who was killed in police custody in May after a policeman knelt on his neck for several minutes - speakers urged attendees to vote for change.\n\nThe 2020 March fell on the 57th anniversary of the 1963 civil rights March on Washington, an iconic event in American history, credited with spurring the passage of the Civil Rights Act outlawing segregation the following year. \n\nYolanda Renee King, the granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr was among Friday's speakers. \n\nThe event was organised by civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton and the eldest son of Martin Luther King Jr, Martin Luther King III.\n\nGeorge Floyd's sister, Bridgett Floyd, asked protesters to be his legacy, three months after his death - which set off a wave of demonstrations across the US and the globe. \n\n\"My brother cannot be a voice today,\"Floyd said.\"We have to be that voice, we have to be that change.\"\n\nThe event comes amid renewed national tension after Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot seven times in the back by police in Wisconsin.\n\nHis father, Jacob Blake Sr, at the rally on Friday told those gathered that they were holding court on racism in America, and the verdict was\"guilty, guilty, guilty\". \n\nOther presenters included a young activist calling for an end to the gun violence plaguing black communities, and representatives from unions, gay rights groups, and Hispanic activism groups, who expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. \n\nAll photos subject to copyright\nTL;DR: After a summer of tension, unrest, and protests over police brutality against African Americans in the US, some 50,000 demonstrators gathered in Washington to demand racial justice.\n\nArticle: Devolution allows local government to control certain budgets and services in exchange for a directly elected mayor.\n\nOf the six councils in the proposed Liverpool City Region, St Helens and Halton are believed to be sceptical.\n\nBut Mr Anderson told the BBC:\"If people don't want to be part of it, then they should walk away.\"\n\nHis comments came after a government minister told the BBC that Merseyside was not ready to get a so-called\"devolution deal\"following a\"disappointing\"bid.\n\nMr Anderson said he was\"surprised\"to hear this criticism and insisted he was\"confident\"the bid would meet the government's expectations.\n\nHe also said it would proceed even if some of the six councils - five in Merseyside plus Halton, which is geographically in Cheshire - do not support the idea of a mayor for the whole area.\n\nThey have previously insisted they wanted a referendum on whether to have a directly elected leader.\n\nMr Anderson said:\"What I would say to people who don't want to be part of the process is to be honest about that, talk to us about that and, no hard feelings, pull out of it.\n\n\"This is a deal. It's not something that's being forced upon anybody and I'd much rather say that if anyone's not happy with it or dissatisfied with it, to walk away.\"\n\nAsked whether devolution could proceed without the full support of every council leader in the region, Mr Anderson said he\"wanted everyone to be involved\".\n\nBut he added:\"The government have made it clear that people can drop out of the process.\n\n\"That is something they would honour. If people don't want to be part of it they would try to do a deal with those that do.\"\n\nEarlier this year Mr Anderson said critics of plans to devolve more powers to the region were\"bringing the area into disrepute\".\nTL;DR: Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson wants plans for Merseyside devolution to go ahead even if some of the region's council leaders do not support them.\n\nArticle: By Alice CuddyBBC News\n\nStan Berman says there are three reasons his doughnuts were so good. \n\nThe first was the sea air that blew into his shop from the Pacific Ocean some five miles away - he never used air conditioning, even at the height of the LA summer, to avoid spoiling the perfect atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe second reason was the skill that went into making the doughnuts. And the third, simply, was love.\n\nStan took over his shop in the heart of LA's bustling Westwood Village neighbourhood more than 55 years ago. The unassuming one-storey white-block building sits on the corner of two busy streets. Stan described it as\"the smallest little shop you've ever seen\".\n\nIt was prime real estate: less than two blocks away from the UCLA campus and opposite the Fox Bruin and Fox Village cinemas where glamorous premieres would frequently take place.\n\nThe exact date it all began is a matter of debate. He believes it was Christmas time 1963, while others in his family think it was 1964. What everyone can agree on is that it quickly made its mark.\n\nWhen Stan first took over it was called The Corner Shoppe - a distributor for pastries, pies, cookies and\"everything else like that\". Everything, that is, apart from doughnuts.\n\nStan came from a long line of Jewish bread bakers. As a child, he would wake up before dawn to fry doughnuts at his father's little Philadelphia bakery, finishing them off with a generous coating of granulated sugar. When people came in to buy a loaf of bread in the morning, they'd pick up one of Stan's doughnuts too. \n\nHe later learned how to make intricate European-inspired pastries. \n\nThe Corner Shoppe had equipment for baking, but when Stan first took over it only sold other people's food. \n\nThen fate stepped in.\n\nOne Sunday morning when the shop was closed, Stan popped in to clean up and, noticing the heavy footfall in the area, saw an opportunity. He called a friend in the bakery business who brought him flour, yeast and everything else he needed.\n\nHe made a piece of dough and fried a batch of doughnuts, then sold them through the shop's window.\n\nIt soon became a routine. Every Sunday, Stan would head into work at about 04:00 to make doughnuts; his wife would drive his three children down a few hours later to sell his creations; and with the money they made, the family would go out for dinner in the evening.\n\nOn Monday mornings people started coming in looking for doughnuts. \n\n\"They'd say'Stan why aren't you making doughnuts?'\"Stan, now 90, recalls.\"And I'd say'Well you know, we're not really doing that'. Then, before you know it, we were doing that.\"\n\nThe Corner Shoppe became The Corner Donut Shoppe and eventually Stan's Donuts.\n\nDoughnuts were considered at the low-end of the bakery business, but Stan applied the techniques for making fine pastries learned in his youth to create a new product.\n\n\"They were so different from most doughnuts, even though I used the same flour, and shortenings and toppings,\"he says. \n\n\"My idea was I'm going to make something you really like. Tell me what you like and I'm going to try and make something for you as a doughnut so you will come in for yours - I did that for hundreds of people.\"\n\nHe packed his array of flavours - cherry, chocolate, cinnamon, peanut butter - into a display case that\"blasted\"people when they walked into the tiny room.\n\nBefore long, Stan was selling thousands of doughnuts every day.\n\nHis growing reputation and proximity to the two LA cinemas meant some of Hollywood's biggest stars were among his customers.\n\nWhen one of her movies was playing across the road, actress Ali MacGraw and her partner Steve McQueen would frequently drive up to Stan's shop on a motorcycle, get a cup of coffee and a doughnut and sit outside on the kerb to watch people going into the cinema.\n\nElizabeth Taylor - one of Hollywood's most glamorous women - ordered coffee and doughnuts with a group of friends. Not that Stan recognised her - a passer-by pointed her out.\n\nWilly Wonka actor Gene Wilder and Hollywood filmmaker Mel Brooks were also regulars. But Stan had one rule: he never took photos of the stars coming into his shop.\n\n\"I wanted them to be comfortable to come in and share my doughnuts,\"he says. \n\nCementing its place in Hollywood history, the shop's original signage was restored for a scene in Quentin Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nIn more recent years, Stan's Donuts has been frequented by a Nobel laureate and senior staff at the nearby UCLA - as well as many students.\n\n\"For generations, numerous UCLA departments have shared boxes of Stan's Donuts to celebrate special occasions, myriad student groups have sold them as fundraisers for worthy causes, and so many on our campus have had their days brightened by one (or more) of your delicious treats,\"the chancellor of the university, Gene Block, said in a recent letter to Stan.\n\nWhen the animated show The Simpsons turned 20, producers ordered batches of Stan's Homer Simpson doughnuts - pink frosting, sprinkles - for Fox affiliates.\n\nSimpsons writer Carolyn Omine tweeted that the shop was among her first memories of LA. Stan's cherry cheesecake doughnut was her favourite.\n\nWhile the doughnuts themselves might have been the biggest reason for the shop's success, Stan also became a star in his own right, and he revelled in the attention.\n\n\"We would bump into people all over the world, people who knew us from the doughnut shop,\"he recalls with glee.\"We couldn't go to a movie, we couldn't go anywhere where someone wouldn't tap me on the shoulder and say'Hey Stan'.\"\n\nHis shop's success and longevity earned it iconic status in LA. The city declared 3 May 2014\"Stan's Donuts Day\", and the shop was named a\"Monumental Business\".\n\nLooking back, Stan says he has had\"the most unbelievable life and it all came from the doughnut shop\".\n\nHe believes part of his success was due to him always being\"the finisher\". Even in old age, he would go into the shop every day - he'd make the icing, clean the pots and sweep the floors.\n\nHe was a perfectionist and expected the same attention to detail from his small team of staff. His favourite doughnut was his raisin buttermilk bar because as soon as he took a bite he could tell whether the fryer had been cleaned.\n\nIt was also the doughnut he'd give away to customers after a friendly chat at his shop. He gave away plenty over the years - he could never bear to throw any away at the end of the day.\n\nBut as well as being responsible for his successes, he says there were\"one or two events\"in his life where his shop caused problems.\n\nStan's first employee was a close friend called Norman. Together they were known as\"the doughnut men\". But the pair fell out when Stan missed Norman's wife's funeral because he was making doughnuts. They were never able to reconcile.\n\n\"The problem was that the shop was so important to me that I couldn't see other things around,\"Stan says.\n\nStan was still frying doughnuts into his 80s, but he had a stroke about three years ago and was forced to take a step back from his business, going to the shop once a week with his son. Without Stan there every day, sales were not what they used to be.\n\nDespite the struggles, Stan hoped that he would still have the business when he turned 100. But he couldn't have anticipated the coronavirus pandemic, or the impact it would have on his little shop in LA.\n\nRestaurants in the city were ordered to close in mid-March in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, with only takeaways and deliveries allowed. UCLA moved its classes online. Sales dropped dramatically.\n\nSince 2014, Stan has been making money in royalties from Stan's Donuts & Coffee - a successful line of shops in Chicago with a range of doughnuts inspired by his Westwood creations. But that money has dried up in recent months, with business there also suffering under the pandemic.\n\nWith so much uncertainty about the virus, Stan and his family worried how long it would go on for.\n\n\"We did a bit of business, maybe 40%, but 40% didn't pay the labour,\"Stan says.\n\nHis daughter Pam says coronavirus\"killed the business\".\n\n\"We had to make the choice of whether to stay open by going into my father's savings and it wasn't worth it,\"she explains. Without the pandemic\"we would have continued. The store would have stayed open until my father passed away.\"\n\nFor Pam it has left a\"sweet and sour feeling\".\n\n\"It was so much aggravation trying to run the store without my father there - that's what made it a bit easier to close the doors. But it's been very sad.\"\n\nWith a stay-at-home order in place in LA, there was no party to bid farewell to the shop when it closed its doors in April.\n\nStan has been left to settle reluctantly into retirement, while trying to come to terms with losing the two loves of his life - his doughnut shop and his wife of 68 years, Ina, who passed away in January.\n\nHe has received scores of letters from people mourning the loss of the shop and celebrating their memories there. He likens it to witnessing his own obituary.\n\nHis grandson, who has a tattoo of the shop's logo, took the equipment and is now learning to make doughnuts himself.\n\n\"It's not going to be Stan's Donuts but he wants to continue my father's legacy with making and selling doughnuts. That's what he's hoping to do,\"Pam says.\n\nAt the Westwood Village shop, a note announcing its closure remains stuck to a window - a quiet end to a business loved by so many. \n\n\"I hope that you will remember how our donuts made you smile for many years to come,\"it says.\n\nThe note ends:\"With Love, Stan Berman.\"\nTL;DR: The coronavirus pandemic has dealt a hard blow to businesses around the world. In the US alone, economists project that more than 100,000 small businesses have permanently shut because of the health crisis. Among those are iconic institutions that have survived for decades. Stan's Donuts in Los Angeles is one of them.\n\nArticle: By Anthony ReubenBBC Reality Check\n\nThe government is confusing GDP per household with household income.\n\nGDP per household is what you get when you add up everything produced in the economy in a year and divide it by the number of households. GDP per household does have an impact on household income, but not on a pound-for-pound basis - so you would expect it to fall by somewhat less than \u00a34,300.\n\nIf you think about it, this must be the case. GDP is currently about \u00a31.8tn a year - if you divide that by 27 million households you get \u00a366,666. But average household income is about \u00a344,000. They are clearly not the same thing.\n\nAnother thing to stress is that the Treasury is not saying that the economy would be this much per household worse off than they are now in 2030. It is saying that the economy would be 6% smaller in 2030 if the UK left the EU than it would be if it stayed in.\n\nBut the question is, how much do we believe in this sort of study at all. Reality Check has discussed in the past the problems with economic modelling.\n\nIf you don't want to be influenced by economic modelling then look away now, after all, it is very difficult to predict anything in 15 years.\n\nIf you are still reading, the thing to take away from this morning's events is this: ignore the headline figures - the Treasury thinks that leaving the EU would be bad for the UK economy, reducing its output by a considerable amount.\n\nIf what you care about is economic modelling, then this is a perfectly respectable piece of modelling, following broadly similar methodology to the one from the Centre for Economic Performance, although headlining the figure taking into account dynamic effects rather than static ones (dynamic models include changes that happen over time such as trade increasing competition or efficiency).\n\nThis is not hugely surprising - economic models tend to assume that free trade and economic cooperation are a good thing.\n\nLooking into the detail, it is a bit odd that throughout the analysis the Treasury has used ONS forecasts for what will happen to population by 2030, without considering what difference leaving the EU would make. Given that one of the key points of leaving the EU is supposed to be to tighten up the UK's borders, it seems a mistake not to take into account that effect. It would be expected to reduce the supply of workers, although the Treasury model predicts a rise in unemployment following an exit from the UK, so there would also be less demand. The effect is discussed in more detail here. \n\nThere has also been criticism of the decision to base part of the calculation on the number of households today rather than a forecast for the number of households in 2030, which is expected to be considerably higher.\n\nThe Treasury explained that the reason this was done was to provide an illustration of what 6% lower GDP would look like to households today. So they took 2015 GDP in 2015 prices and divided by the number of households in 2015. Had they decided to use forecasts for 2030, the number of households would have been higher, but so would the level of GDP.\n\nOne useful thing from this Treasury report is that it helps put into context the significance of the UK's contribution to the EU Budget. The Treasury says that the 6% of GDP in 2030 would cut tax receipts by \u00a336bn, dwarfing the contributions to the EU. Indeed, the Treasury has reached the \u00a336bn figure after subtracting the UK's \u00a37bn a year average net contribution.\n\nReality Check verdict: The precise figure is questionable and probably not particularly helpful. If you want to be influenced by economic modelling, the useful thing to take away is that the Treasury thinks leaving the EU would be bad for the economy, by an amount that would dwarf the savings from not having to contribute to the EU Budget.\n\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate\nTL;DR: The poster at George Osborne's event this morning made a bold claim - that there would be a \u00a34,300-a-year cost to families by 2030 if Britain leaves the EU.\n\nArticle: Stanley Johnson denied that he was calling for the change at the request of his son, the London mayor and ex-MP who has been tipped as a future leader. \n\nHe said the move was\"hypothetical\"since the party would win the 2015 election with David Cameron in charge. \n\nBut the call nonetheless fuelled speculation about his son's prospects. \n\nBoris Johnson has said he plans to serve his full term in office as London Mayor, which is due to run out in 2016. \n\n'Have a crack'\n\nBut there has been speculation that he might seek to return to the Commons to mount a leadership bid. There is no rule against serving both as an MP and as mayor. \n\nHe once admitted he would like to\"have a crack\"at being prime minister\"'if the ball came loose from the back of a scrum\".\n\nMr Johnson Sr, a politician and former EU official, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:\"As you know, the Conservatives firmly expect to win an overall majority at the next election. \n\n\"We firmly expect the leader to be in place then. It's a question of just getting some appropriate system. \n\n\"It doesn't seem to me to be reasonable in this day and age, you know, you have got plenty of candidates out there. Why should the candidates only be Members of Parliament? \n\n\"I'm really suggesting that there are other people who have been elected, there have for example been MEPs, you know these are a reasonable bunch of people - men and women.\n\n\"All I'm saying is there is a case for looking at the rules.

Mr Haines's family said he would be\"missed terribly\".\n\nBorn in Holderness, East Yorkshire, Mr Haines went to school in Perth and had been living in Croatia with his second wife, who is Croatian, and their four-year-old daughter. His parents live in Ayr.\n\n'Despicable and appalling'\n\nIn a statement released by the Foreign Office, Mike Haines said his brother, a father of two,\"was and is loved by all his family\".\n\n\"David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,\"he said.\n\nMr Cameron, who chaired an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Sunday morning, said the murder of an innocent aid worker was\"despicable and appalling\".\n\n\"It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes,\"the prime minister added.\n\n'Grief and resolve'\n\nThe Foreign Office is working to verify the video, which was released on Saturday night.

I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution.\"\n\nHe says Mr Cameron had entered into a coalition with the US against the Islamic State\"just as your predecessor Tony Blair did\".\n\n\"Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our parliament's selfish decisions,\"he said.\n\nThe militant, who appears to have a British accent, is then recorded as saying:\"This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State.\"\n\nIslamic State is now in control of large parts of northern Iraq and Syria, and the CIA estimates that the group could have as many as 30,000 fighters in the region.\n\nThe UK has donated heavy machine guns and ammunition to authorities in Iraq to help fight IS militants, the Ministry of Defence has previously said.\n\nKurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have been involved in heavy fighting with IS.\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nMr Haines's death has been condemned by international political leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, French President Francois Hollande, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.\n\nUS President Barack Obama said the US would work with the UK and other countries to\"bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice\".\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government\"will not rest\"until Mr Haines's killers\"face justice\".\n\nMr Alex Salmond said a resilience meeting - the Scottish government's version of the UK's Cobra security meeting - would be held on Sunday morning to discuss issues such as the privacy of Mr Haines's family.\n\nThe leader of the Better Together campaign in Scotland, Alistair Darling, said Mr Haines's death\"inexcusable, a barbaric act\"that would\"strengthen the resolve of the international community\". \n\nJustice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would like to see the militant in the video\"face justice in a British court - he's a British citizen and has been boasting of that\".\n\nAnalysis: Jim Muir, BBC News\n\nThe beheadings of David Haines, and the two American journalists before him, are believed to have been filmed in the desert near Raqqa, a provincial capital in north-east Syria which has become the unofficial capital of the self-styled Islamic State. \n\nFar from being just a shadowy terror group, IS controls a large swathe of territory in the north and east of Syria, linked since June to almost all the mainly Sunni parts of Iraq. \n\nIt controls a population of around 5 or 6 million people, including Iraq's second city, Mosul. \n\nIn northern Iraq, the Kurds, helped by US air strikes, are slowly regaining the ground they lost to IS when it suddenly turned on them last month. \n\nThat's the template the Americans and their allies want to apply to other parts of Iraq, and Syria, but the situation in both countries is complicated by the absence of clear-cut, cohesive local forces on the ground to work with. \n\nElsewhere, religious leaders have also reacted to the killing, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who posted a call on Twitter for prayers for the family of Mr Haines, who was\"evilly killed\".\n\nShuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain said:\"These extremists wish to draw attention and recruits to their cause by sowing division and fear between people here in Britain.

It was a reward for supporting David Cameron, who attended Oxford University at the same time as him, in the Conservative leadership election.  \n\n\n\n2018-presentForeign secretary\n\n2012-2018Health secretary\n\n2010-2012Culture secretary\n\n2007-2010Shadow culture secretary\n\n2005-2007 Shadow minister for disabled people\n\nA reshuffle in 2007 saw Mr Hunt promoted to shadow culture secretary. \n\nIn 2009, he was found to have breached expenses rules and ordered to repay more than \u00a39,500. He had allowed his agent to stay rent-free in his constituency property, which was designated as his second home.\n\nMr Hunt had claimed \u00a319,117 in public money towards the property, but it was decided he hadn't benefited financially from the situation. \n\nCulture secretary\n\nWhen the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed in 2010, Jeremy Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport.\n\nOlympics\n\nIt was a key role in the run-up to London's 2012 Olympics and he worked closely with then London Mayor, Boris Johnson. \n\nMr Hunt campaigned on the importance of tourism during the Olympics. And he took the decision to double the budget for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies from \u00a340m to \u00a381m. \n\nThe Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a big success.\n\nMr Hunt also put emphasis on creating a lasting legacy for the games. \n\nThe government gave Sport England \u00a31bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Mr Hunt said there was an\"extraordinary chance\"to\"reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old\".\n\nBut in the years that followed there was only a small increase in the number of young people taking up sport. \n\nIn 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%.\n\nBSkyB takeover\n\nEarlier in 2012, his career was hanging in the balance. During the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, his contact with the Murdoch family came under scrutiny.\n\nMr Hunt was responsible for overseeing the proposed takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. \n\nHe was criticised for failing to supervise his adviser's contact with News Corp, and for messages he exchanged with James Murdoch on the bid. His special adviser, Adam Smith, was forced to quit.\n\nThe inquiry released texts sent from Mr Hunt to News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel when it was bidding for BSkyB. The culture secretary addressed him as\"Daddy\"and\"mon ami\"- their wives had given birth in the same hospital in May 2010. Separately, in December 2010, he told Mr Michel there was\"nothing u won't like\"in a forthcoming speech.\n\nMr Hunt insisted he acted with\"total integrity\"during the bid process. \n\nLocal television\n\nAs culture secretary, Mr Hunt also led a government plan to launch local television stations across the UK. More than 30 had been set up before Ofcom later scrapped the roll-out of any further channels, because of limited interest from viewers and financial difficulties. \n\nCity TV, the holder of the local TV licence for Birmingham, was forced to appoint administrators to find a buyer before it was even launched, for example.\n\nBBC\n\nMr Hunt also announced a deal with the BBC to freeze the licence fee for six years at \u00a3145.50 from 2010. He said high executive salaries and an advantage over commercial broadcasters were a cause for concern. \n\nThat was equivalent to a 16% budget cut in real terms and led to the BBC having to make savings, including 2,000 job losses. \n\nUnder the agreement, the BBC also took on responsibility for funding the World Service, the Welsh language channel S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas. \n\nBoris Johnson: The other leadership contender\n\nWhat's Boris Johnson's track record?\n\nHealth secretary\n\nJeremy Hunt was appointed health secretary in September 2012, with Maria Miller taking on his previous role. \n\nHe would eventually become the longest-serving health secretary in NHS history, surpassing its founder, Labour's Aneurin Bevan. \n\nNHS funding\n\nBut Mr Hunt held office during the slowest period of investment in the NHS since its foundation - which created big problems.\n\nSince the NHS was established, health spending has risen by about 4% above inflation each year on average. Post-2010, as the coalition budget tried to reduce the deficit, this fell to about 1% a year. \n\nThis came as demands on the health service were growing. \n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, A&E visits went up by almost 30%. And during Mr Hunt's tenure as health secretary, the number of people in the population aged 85 and over went up by about a third.  \n\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility said funding for the NHS needed to rise by 4.3% a year just to keep up with rising demand, without actively improving standards.\n\nFinancial difficulties led to more hospitals going into the red, as well as targets being missed in three main areas: cancer care, hospital appointments and A&E waiting times. \n\nNHS England has not met any of these targets since 2015. \n\nJust 85.3% of patients were seen at A&E departments within the waiting time target of four hours in January 2018. At least 95% of patients attending A&E are supposed to be either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. \n\nUnions, like the GMB, demanded his resignation. \n\nJunior doctors battle\n\nAs well as a series of austerity measures - which included extending a cap on pay increases for NHS staff - he was also criticised for his handling of the junior doctor contract row. \n\nMr Hunt said that changes to contracts were essential to deliver a seven-day NHS in England by 2020 - a pledge in the Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto.\n\nTo achieve this, the proposed contracts would mean evenings and Saturdays would be considered\"normal\"rather than\"unsocial\"hours and would no longer attract overtime pay. \n\nThe NHS's pay review body had said the cost of paying a premium on these\"unsocial hours\"put delivering a seven-day NHS out of reach. \n\nJunior doctors responded by tweeting pictures of themselves working weekend and late shifts, with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. \n\nContract negotiations with junior doctors stopped and started and the British Medical Association eventually decided on industrial action. \n\nJunior doctors took part in a series of walkouts in 2016. On two strike days, between 08:00 and 17:00 even emergency care wasn't covered - the first time that had ever happened in the history of the NHS. \n\nPublic support for the strike was high, and even after doctors withdrew emergency care, the majority of the public (57%) still supported the strike and believed the government was more at fault (54%). \n\nA new contract for junior doctors was later imposed, after BMA members rejected a deal agreed by the government and union negotiators.\n\nDespite heavy criticism, Mr Hunt did go on to secure a funding increase for the NHS, totalling \u00a320.5bn in real terms by 2023. \n\nHe also oversaw the introduction of an Ofsted-style system for rating hospitals and GP surgeries in England, ranking them on things like cancer, mental health and diabetes services. \n\nPatient safety\n\nMr Hunt repeatedly referred in speeches to cases where individuals had received bad treatment in the NHS. He said he was horrified at the report into the Stafford Hospital scandal. \n\nHe went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers.\n\nSocial care\n\nSocial care was added to his brief in 2018. He spoke of the need to integrate social care, funded by local councils, with services delivered by the NHS.  \n\nHe had already overseen a transfer of money from the NHS to council budgets from 2014. This shared budget was designed to tackle the problem of elderly people having to stay in hospital beds unnecessarily, because of a lack of care for them at home.\n\nAfter this, the number of these cases fell. \n\nHe also oversaw the introduction of the first national waiting-time target for mental health treatment. From April 2016, the NHS said at least 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis should begin treatment within two weeks of referral. \n\nForeign secretary\n\nMr Hunt became foreign secretary in July 2018, after his predecessor and now leadership rival, Boris Johnson, quit over Theresa May's Brexit strategy.\n\nIn March, he became the first Western foreign minister to visit Yemen since conflict there began. \n\nHe has faced criticism for allowing the UK to sell arms to the Saudi regime, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. But he has previously defended UK-Saudi ties, saying Saudi Arabia is a\"very, very important military ally to the UK\".\n\nHis time as foreign secretary has not been gaffe-free. During a meeting on an official visit to China, he called his wife Lucia Guo\"Japanese\"- although she was born in Xian in central China. \n\nPosition on Brexit\n\nA Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since said he would vote Leave in a second vote. He said this was because of the\"arrogance of the European Commission\"in Brexit negotiations.\n\nHe also likened the Brexit negotiating tactics of the EU to the Soviet Union. The comparison provoked criticism from EU ambassadors and politicians and there were calls for an apology.\n\nMr Hunt says he want to negotiate a\"credible\"Brexit plan by securing changes to the controversial Irish backstop.\n\nHowever, he does not rule out leaving the EU without a deal if such an outcome becomes\"the only way to deliver Brexit\". \n\nBut unlike his leadership rival, Boris Johnson, he says the current departure date of 31 October is not a hard deadline.\nTL;DR: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face Boris Johnson in the run-off to become Conservative leader and prime minister.\n\nArticle: The Institute of Space Research said there were 17,326 fires in the Amazon, compared to 7,855 in October 2019.  \n\nSatellite data also suggests that there was a record number of fires in the Pantanal wetlands last month.\n\nCampaigners say the government is failing to stop the rise in fires, but the government denies it is to blame. \n\nIn July, the government imposed a 120-day ban on setting fires and deployed the army to badly hit areas, but the latest figures from Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (Inpe) suggest the measures have not curbed the blazes.\n\nData released by Inpe on Sunday suggests there were 2,856 fires in the Pantanal region in October, the biggest monthly figure since records began over 30 years ago.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has not commented on the latest figures, but has previously dismissed data from Inpe as flawed. He has also said the criticism levelled against his government over the fires was\"disproportionate\".\n\nWhile the figures for October - traditionally a month when rains bring some relief - are particularly alarming, those for the year so far are also worrying environmentalists.  \n\nAccording to Inpe, 93,485 fires have been recorded in the Amazon so far this year - 25% more than in the same period in 2019, when President Bolsonaro's handling of the forest fires drew international condemnation.\n\nBrazil's Amazon region has been the hardest hit, with 46% of all blazes occurring there. \n\nBut environmentalists are also alarmed by the steep rise in fires in the Pantanal, one of the world's most biodiverse areas and home to animals such as the jaguar and the capuchin monkey.\n\nMariana Napolitano, the head of the science programme at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil, told the AFP news agency that despite the four-month government-imposed ban on lighting fires, some of the blazes appeared to be man-made. \n\n\"After deforesting the jungle, the offenders set fires to clean up the accumulated organic material... At the end of the month, with the arrival of the rains, the pace of the fires seems to be slowing down, but we can hardly depend on climate factors,\"she warned.\n\n\"What happened in the dry season in the Amazon and Pantanal cannot be repeated,\"she added. \n\nYou may also be interested in:\nTL;DR: The number of fires blazing in Brazil's Amazon region in October 2020 was more than double those in the same month last year, satellite data suggests.\n\nArticle: By Nick RobinsonPresenter, Today programme\n\nThe question is who will give it? Not our prime minister - for now that is. David Cameron says that is up to his successor - whoever he or she might be. \n\nHis friends are more brutal: it is the job of those who broke it to mend it.\n\nOsborne: UK in a position of strength\n\nCorbyn vows to fight for leadership\n\nEU co-operation to'intensify' - Johnson\n\nFollow the latest developments on our live page\n\nUK's EU referendum: All you need to know\n\nWhat of them then? After a weekend of playing cricket and planning his Tory leadership bid, Boris Johnson emerged briefly for the cameras on Monday morning.\n\nHe wanted to dispel\"confusion\"about the rights of European migrants living here already, but he has still to offer anything like a concrete plan on how he would negotiate the post-Brexit future.\n\nSo, for now the questions: When do we leave the EU and on what terms? Who will do the negotiations? What will it mean for immigration, for trade, for travel, for the city, for agriculture, for those from the EU living here and Brits abroad? All have no answers - and none in prospect either.\n\nThis morning the chancellor did break his silence. He sought to calm the nerves in a statement from the Treasury, saying preparations have been made for turbulence in the markets so that, he said, we are equipped for whatever happens. \n\nBut he, too, insisted that the big decisions, including those on higher taxes and new spending cuts - the sort he warned before the vote - would have to wait for a new occupant of Number 10 and no doubt Number 11 as well. \n\nWe will hear more from David Cameron as he makes a Commons statement. \n\nThis you may think - particularly if you voted for Leave - is an unduly pessimistic view of what flows from what has been dubbed Independence Day for what was until last week the fifth largest economy in the world. After all aren't we in charge of our own destiny now?  \n\nWell, yes\u2026 and no.\n\nLast Thursday's momentous vote was a vote to begin divorce proceedings. Or, if you like, to move out of the house we share with 27 other countries. \n\nIt did not, though, come with any plan - let alone an agreement - as to where we are moving next or what our relationship will be in future with those we used to share our life with. \n\nNo Plan B?\n\nAsked a few days before the vote whether he had such a plan for the day after if the Leave campaign won Boris Johnson was brutally frank - in private at least. No was his answer. \n\nHe and other Leavers declared their hope that David Cameron would have one and would stay in office to implement it. \n\nBut Cameron was determined not to be the one tasked with clearing up a mess which, he believes, they created. \n\nBesides he believes he would have no credibility doing so either at home - with the electorate who rejected his pleas to remain in the EU - or in Brussels - with leaders who listened when he assured them that he could and would win the referendum. \n\nWhen he first proposed a referendum three years ago I asked the prime minister what his Plan B was if his renegotiation failed or he lost the referendum. \n\nHe refused to contemplate any such possibility. I asked him again during the general election campaign - he was no more willing to consider failure. The civil service were banned from making plans for Brexit.\n\n'No vacuum'\n\nSo it is that this morning a lame duck leader and his former friend and close political ally, the visibly shell-shocked Michael Gove, will meet with the rest of the Cabinet to begin what we are told are initial discussions about the apparatus which will prepare for negotiations with our soon to be former partners in the EU. \n\nIn other words, they will discuss how a plan for what it is hoped will be an amicable separation could be drawn up and who might do it. \n\nAs for the plan itself, let alone the filing of the divorce papers themselves, that will have to wait until a new prime minister is elected in the autumn - not, let us remember, by the electorate, but by Tory party members.\n\nThis, insist insiders, is not a vacuum. It is nothing more than a weekend pause after a bruising campaign with an outcome which no-one - on either side - expected. \n\nIt is best, they say, to take things slowly - one step at a time. Besides, add those who campaigned for Leave, what's the rush? \n\nAfter all nothing actually needs to change in our relationship with the EU for two years - that's how long the rules of the European Club give us to negotiate Brexit. \n\nIt is they - the Europeans - who are in a hurry to quit - not us to get out.\n\nMaybe. But that assumes that it is those gathered around the Cabinet table who are - to coin a phrase - in control. It may be, though, that markets and boardrooms demand swifter answers and, if they don't get them will move their money and the jobs that come with it. \n\nIt may also be that those who voted Leave anticipating a swift dividend in the form of lower immigration and more funds for the NHS might also become a little impatient if what will soon be seen as the new establishment fail to deliver just as the old establishment did. \n\nThe fallout from the biggest exercise in popular democracy has already been dramatic - claiming the scalp of a Prime Minister and, potentially, that of the opposition leader too. \n\nIt has, though, only just begun. The old order has been smashed.\n\nIt may be a very long time - not weeks, not months but years - before the shape of the new order and the answers to all those questions become clear.\nTL;DR: WANTED. For a small island heading to an unknown destination in dangerous times: Leadership.\n\nArticle: How are Venezuela's neighbours coping? \n\nTensions have been mounting among Venezuela's neighbours. In August, there were clashes on the Brazil-Venezuela border between migrants and locals. \n\nEcuador and Peru restricted entry of Venezuelans to those with passports, although Ecuador's decision was later overturned by a judge. It drew criticism from neighbours like Colombia. Ecuador also declared a state of emergency in parts of the country most affected by migration. \n\nFind out more about Venezuela's crisis:\n\nAll of this led people to worry that the region was starting to shut down, at a time when Venezuelans most need help. But, say experts, the past few weeks need to be put into context. \n\n\"The reality is that very quietly for two years, South Americans have welcomed more than two million Venezuelans without taking any of these restrictive measures,\"says Benjamin Gedan of the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington DC. \n\n\"They are now reaching their capacities and their political systems are reacting. This region has been much, much more generous than is the trend in the rest of the world.\"\n\nWhat are countries in the region doing? \n\nSome have criticised the regional response as haphazard. But in recent weeks, Latin American nations seem to be working together. \n\nBrazil is stepping up efforts to relocate Venezuelans from the isolated north of the country to bigger cities like Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo so they can find work and settle more easily. \n\nAt the beginning of September, Ecuador also hosted a summit that ended with an 18-point declaration made by 11 countries in the region. \n\nIn it, they agreed the need for more cooperation and information sharing, as well as extra support for the countries most affected by migration, such as Colombia. \n\nAre Venezuelan migrants adequately protected? \n\nLatin America has some of the most advanced laws in the world when it comes to migrants and refugees. \n\nMany countries established the laws when immigration was not a concern - people were leaving the region for Europe and the US. But those times have changed with the Venezuelan migration crisis.\n\n\"The Venezuelan displacement I see as a first test of this liberalisation of immigration and refugee laws in the region,\"says Feline Freier of the University of the Pacific in Peru.\n\nWhile many countries use the 1951 Refugee Convention to define a refugee, most of the region uses a broader definition shaped from The Cartagena Declaration on Refugees in 1984. \n\nIt defines refugees as including people who have fled the country because of generalised violence and massive violation of human rights that have disturbed public order - so under Cartagena, says Ms Freire, most Venezuelans would be classified as refugees. \n\nThere is still a reluctance to classify the situation as a full-on refugee crisis, as that comes with more responsibilities than a migrant crisis. \n\nThe UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has referred to a\"mixed flow\"of migrants and refugees. \n\nThe region in turn has preferred to integrate Venezuelans into society rather than categorise them as refugees. \n\nThe US and EU have sanctioned Venezuela, but not the UN - could that change? \n\nJust last week, the US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, called on members of the UN Security Council to take steps for more concrete action against Venezuela. \n\nBut with permanent Security Council members Russia and China still allies of Venezuela, there is little prospect of agreement among the Council members. Added to that, there have to be specific conditions to merit a UN Security Council response. \n\n\"There isn't the level of violence that would make it easy to argue that Venezuela is a threat to international peace and security that demands Security Council action,\"says Marcos Tourinho of the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\n\"If the crisis becomes even more internationalised than it is now, I think you could see pressure from neighbouring states to have more action in the Security Council. But it's not reached that point yet.\"\n\nCan the US help? \n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened military action, but that has been widely condemned. \n\nJust this weekend, the Lima Group of Latin American countries expressed its concern after the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, said military intervention would not be ruled out. \n\nThe US has given more than $46m (\u00a335m) in humanitarian aid but beyond that, experts say US leadership on the issue is unlikely. \n\n\"The US is traditionally the leader in the Western Hemisphere on issues of humanitarian concern, particularly on refugee issues,\"says Benjamin Gedan. \n\n\"Although it would be nice for the US to play a leadership role, it would also be laughable and deeply hypocritical for the US to strong-arm countries in the region to act humanely towards Venezuelan migrants when the US has such a restrictionist policy right now regarding immigrants and refugees.\"\n\n\"The US has completely lost credibility on what is one of the most pressing global concerns.\"\nTL;DR: It has been called one of the worst migration crises in Latin America's history. The United Nations has said it could reach a \"crisis point' comparable to what was seen in the Mediterranean in 2015. And Brazil's President Michel Temer has warned it is now a threat to the peace of all of South America.  \n\nThe BBC's South America correspondent, Katy Watson, looks at how the crisis has been dealt with so far and what more can be done.\n\nArticle: The government is expected to commit \u00a3300m to kick-start transport projects, with details due in Wednesday's Budget.\n\nChancellor George Osborne will confirm government backing for the HS3 rail link between Manchester and Leeds.\n\nThe Railfuture campaign group said by the time upgrades were made they would be\"outdated and overcrowded again\".\n\nThe HS3 rail link proposal is a key part of the government's Northern Powerhouse plan - which attempts to redress the north/south divide and attract investment to the north.\n\nThinktank IPPR North said government backing of HS3 would be\"no substitute\"for construction work actually beginning.\n\nThe organisation's director, Ed Cox, said the region would expect the government to invest significant amounts of public money to finally get the\"spades in the ground\"just as it had done with Crossrail in London. \n\nChris Hyomes, chair of Railfuture in Yorkshire, said:\"George Osborne needs to find out how to speed the process up and make it simpler so these improvements happen quicker.\n\n\"We're looking at improving roads and railways, but by the time they are improved they are going to be outdated and overcrowded again.\n\n\"What we're going to do in five to 10 years' time should have been done 10 or 20 years ago.\"\n\n'Passengers crammed on'\n\nLouise Ellman, chair of the Commons' Transport Select Committee and Liverpool Riverside MP, described improving trans-Pennine links as\"equally important\"to the North as London's \u00a314.8bn east-to-west Crossrail route, which is due to open in phases from next year.\n\nShe added:\"We need to know the detail of what is being proposed.\"\n\nA HM Treasury spokesperson said:\"The Chancellor is determined to shake Britain out of its inertia in building vital infrastructure, and his Budget this week will back projects like HS3 to make this country fit for the future.\n\n\"Investing in transport across the Northern Powerhouse has been identified as a priority and that's why he will invest \u00a3300m in transport across the region, giving the green light to HS3, accelerating the M62 to a four-lane smart motorway and developing plans to transform east to west connections across the north, including a new Trans Pennine tunnel between Sheffield and Manchester.\" \n\nSome rail commuters at Manchester Piccadilly Station said a faster line between the two cities was necessary.\n\nOne man said:\"Room is a big issue, it's always full and it takes a long time as well. They are always cancelled and delayed so it needs something doing to it.\"\n\nAnother said:\"In the morning they are crammed on, every time I ever get on it - there are people struggling to even get on the train.\"\n\nBen Harrison, from thinktank Centre for Cities, said:\"The Leeds-Manchester train link is one of the slowest big-city connections in the UK, so this upgrade and investment is much needed. \n\n\"Progressing the delivery of this investment must now be a priority, to ensure the improved train links are operational early in the next Parliament.\"\n\nHow much will HS3 cost? \n\nLen Tingle, BBC Look North's political editor\n\nSixty million pounds allocated towards creating what the Chancellor himself is calling\"HS3\"will be spent on providing a route map of how the destination of improved rail links across the Pennines can be reached.\n\nThis first allocation of public cash is dwarfed by the expected cost of getting the first 125mph express train on the track.\n\nThere have been no official costs yet, but several\"guestimates\"from independent transport experts put the figure around the \u00a37bn mark.\n\nThe problem for the industry is that nobody really knows what HS3 will be. \n\nThe final cost and the timetable for completion will depend on how many extra tunnels, bridges and track extensions it will need. \n\nChris Fletcher, of Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, said the Northern Powerhouse\"must be focused around better transport connections across the North of England and not diluted with hundreds of other schemes and ideas\".  \n\n\"The East-West route is fundamental to allowing a good flow of employees, goods and products to move between the major cities and go where demand is highest. \n\n\"Ask anyone about the time it takes to get between Manchester and Leeds and they all want faster and more reliable journeys. HS3 is part of that solution,\"he added. \n\nUpgrades to east-west road links were\"absolutely essential\"as they lag behind north-south connections, AA president Edmund King said.\n\n\"Plans to upgrade the M62 motorway are long overdue; we've seen very little spent on cross-country infrastructure,\"he said.\n\nMr King said the government must not\"skimp on safety\", as an increasing number of AA members were becoming stranded in\"live lanes\"on smart motorway sections due to a lack of breakdown areas. \n\nMalcolm Bingham, of the Freight Transport Association, said there was an\"over-reliance\"on the M62 motorway. \n\nHe said:\"We've got a single road that creates that connectivity across the Pennines and it only takes a small incident or over-running roadworks to create a massive delay.\"\n\nThe road system was not coping with the traffic levels that it needed to, he warned.    \n\n\"What we need is a network of major routes that connect the north of England. If we don't start moving towards it we'll never see it.\"\n\nAnalysis: Arif Ansari, BBC North West Political Editor \n\nThis feels like the moment that the government starts to put its money where its mouth is. Two years ago George Osborne set out his\"Northern Powerhouse\"idea and transport was critical to its success.  \n\nIn a sense, the National Infrastructure Commission has designed a route map and the Treasury has agreed to pay for the ticket.  But it is only the start of a long journey.  \n\nMuch of it will be spent on planning better rail and road links between Manchester and Leeds. \n\nThese projects are not quick or easy or cheap.  In addition, parts of the M62 will be developed between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds.  The Commission has decided this is the most efficient way to deliver improvements.  \n\nThis all indicates that the Manchester to Leeds axis is still seen as the key component in creating a Northern Powerhouse.  But Lord Adonis, who chairs the commission, has said there is much more to do.  And much more beyond transport too.\nTL;DR: Plans to upgrade road and rail links to boost the so-called Northern Powerhouse are \"too little, too late\", transport groups say.\n\nArticle: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced the measures in its final UK air show safety regulation review following the fatal disaster in 2015.\n\nIt will also strengthen the requirements of post-display reports to\"reflect the importance of feedback\".\n\nA vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August, killing 11.\n\nThe aircraft had been performing aerobatics at the annual Shoreham Airshow when it plummeted to the ground. \n\nThis year's show has been cancelled.\n\nThe head of the CAA, Dame Deirdre Hutton, said the measures were being brought in so the public had\"every confidence that UK air shows meet the highest safety standards\".\n\n'Enjoyed by millions'\n\nShe added:\"We began this review immediately after the accident at Shoreham last summer with the sole purpose of doing all that we can to make UK civil air shows even safer.\n\n\"It has been an extensive review, looking closely at all aspects of air show safety to identify any areas where the system can be strengthened.\n\n\"Air shows are enjoyed by millions of people up and down the country and we want them to be successful.\"\n\nThe\"enhanced measures\"include:\n\nDisplay charges increase\n\nThe CAA said restrictions introduced following the crash in August would remain in place until the Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) had published its final report.\n\nThese measures saw Hawker Hunter jets grounded, ex-military jets restricted to fly-pasts over land and air shows subject to enhanced risk assessments.\n\nThe CAA also increased its air show charges from 1 April - by up to \u00a32,695 for larger displays - to fund the measures.\n\nSywell air display in Northamptonshire will not go ahead because of the\"likelihood of much higher CAA fees\"and the people behind a display at Thockmorton in Worcestershire have threatened to cancel their event.\n\nOrganisers of the Manchester Airshow have blamed the timing of the review on the cancellation of its event this year. \n\nDame Deirdre said the CAA was working with the air-show community to make sure the\"measures are implemented\"for the upcoming display season and beyond\".\n\nThe CAA is responsible for allowing air shows to go ahead and monitoring their safety.\n\nThe victims:\nTL;DR: Ex-military jets will have to perform aerobatic stunts at higher altitude and further away from crowds following a Shoreham crash report.\n\nArticle: Retired Egyptian police general Reda al-Hamamy accused the soldier who shot him of\"using brute force with a poor young man\".\n\nThe French authorities say his son Abdullah, 29, was shot when he attacked the soldiers, injuring one of them.\n\nThey say he shouted the Islamic phrase\"Allahu Akbar\"(\"God is greatest\").\n\nA French police source said Abdullah Hamamy was no longer in a critical condition but was still unable to communicate and could not yet be questioned.\n\nFrench officials have not confirmed the identity of the injured man but Egyptian security sources named him.\n\nPresident Francois Hollande praised the soldiers' actions, saying they had\"prevented an attack whose terrorist nature leaves little doubt\".\n\nThe Louvre, which is home to numerous celebrated art works, including the Mona Lisa, reopened on Saturday.\n\n'Cover-up'\n\nThe suspect arrived in France on 26 January after obtaining a tourist visa in Dubai, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said on Friday.

The full picture.\"\n\nThe star said the full version of Love Story would be released at midnight on Friday, 12 February - exactly 12 years and five months after the original.\n\nShe didn't announce the release date for the album - but hinted it would arrive in April in a coded message on her social media accounts.\n\nThe 31-year-old posted a long essay about the record, written entirely in lower case except for the letters APRIL NINTH.\n\nSwift described the album as\"the diary of the adventures and explorations of a teenage girl who was learning tiny lessons with every new crack in the facade of the fairytale ending she'd been shown in the movies.\"\n\nDiscussing her decision to re-record her music, she added:\"Artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really knows that body of work.\n\n\"For example, only I know which songs I wrote that almost made the Fearless album. Songs I absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons (don't want too many break-up songs, don't want too many down-tempo songs, can't that fit that many songs on a physical CD).\n\n\"Those reasons seem unnecessary now. I've decided I want you to have the whole story.\"\n\nFull ownership\n\nSwift added that the process of recording her old songs had been\"more fulfilling and emotional than I could have imagined, and has made me even more determined to re-record all of my music\".\n\nThe star will have complete control over the new recordings - unlike the originals. Those master tapes were sold to Ithaca Holdings in 2019, then again to investment company Shamrock Holdings last year. \n\nThat means Shamrock receives money when songs like Shake It Off, I Knew You Were Trouble and Love Story are sold, streamed or placed in films and TV shows.\n\nSwift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, still owns the publishing rights, which means she has power to veto some attempts to exploit her recordings.\n\nSpeaking to Billboard magazine in 2019, she said she had turned down\"dozens of requests\"for the use of Shake It Off every week since Braun had bought her back catalogue.\n\nIn future, it is likely that she will only licence the new versions to TV shows, movies and video games. Whether fans prefer to stream the originals or the re-recordings remains to be seen - but completists will want to own both versions. \n\nSwift's announcement caps off a busy 12 months. As well as revamping Fearless, she has created two albums of new music - Folklore and Evermore - the first of which has been nominated for album of the year at the Grammys.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Both are accused of defrauding two firms. \n\nProsecutors are demanding 10 years in jail for him and eight years for his brother.\n\nThe brothers deny the charge that they stole 30m roubles (\u00a3338,500; $526,000) from the firms, one of which is an affiliate of French cosmetics giant Yves Rocher.\n\nAnalysis by Steven Rosenberg, Moscow Correspondent\n\nAlexei Navalny is the opposition figure the Kremlin fears most. A charismatic anti-corruption campaigner turned political activist and a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin. \n\nHe was one of the leaders of the anti-government street protests that engulfed the Russian capital three years ago. The case against him is widely seen as politically motivated. \n\nHe is on trial for fraud and money-laundering - charges he has described as ludicrous and as lies. And because his brother is on trial too he has accused the authorities of trying to take his family hostage to get at him. \n\nThe verdict was to have been announced on 15 January, but in a move that defence lawyers claim is unprecedented it has been brought forward at short notice. That appears to be an attempt to forestall street protests - tens of thousands of people had pledged to attend a rally in support of the brothers in January.\n\nThe new court date comes on the eve of new year, Russia's biggest holiday, which for most people lasts more than a week. \n\nAlexei Navalny led mass protests against Mr Putin in 2011. He has faced a string of criminal charges, which he says are fabricated to neutralise his political influence.\n\nHis house arrest resulted from a five-year suspended sentence he received for the alleged theft of 16m roubles from a timber firm in 2009.\n\nSocial media organiser\n\nIn a statement on his blog, he said ironically:\"It turns out that for good people exceptions can always be made.\"He was responding to supporters' astonishment that the date of sentencing had been brought forward.\n\nA spokeswoman for Moscow's Zamoskvoretskiy court, Yulia Petrova, said later that\"the sentence will be pronounced for the Navalnys on 30 December because the sentence has already been drawn up\". \n\nThe reading of the verdict and sentence is likely to last several hours.\n\nIn 2013 Alexei Navalny came second in Moscow's mayoral election, supported by 27% of voters. \n\nShunned by Russia's main state-owned media he has mobilised thousands of supporters on social media. His supporters have now brought forward their rally to 19:00 (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday. They plan to hold it in Moscow's Manezh Square, near the Kremlin, an announcement on Facebook said.\n\nThe Facebook page announcing their previous plan to protest en masse on 15 January was blocked, at the request of prosecutors.\nTL;DR: One of Russia's best-known opposition leaders, Alexei Navalny, has arrived in court for sentencing on Tuesday, two weeks earlier than originally planned.\n\nArticle: Babies Joshua Titcombe and Alex Davey-Brady, and mother and son Nittaya and Chester Hendrickson died at Furness General Hospital in 2008.\n\nA report by the Health Service Ombudsman found measures failed to identify poor midwifery practice.\n\nNHS England offered its\"deepest apologies\"to the families and said changes had been implemented. \n\n'Unanswered questions'\n\nThe report said:\"In all three cases, the midwifery supervision and regulatory arrangements at the local level failed to identify poor midwifery practice.\n\n\"The families who complained to us could not mourn the loss of their loved ones properly because of the unanswered questions they had about the care provided during the births of their children. \n\n\"The fact that these questions were not addressed appropriately through the processes that are in place is a theme across each of the cases, as is the failure to learn from poor midwifery care, which could have resulted in future service users being put at unnecessary risk.\"\n\nThe report recommended that the NHS make improvements which would involve separate midwifery supervision and regulation.\n\nOne of cases to prompt the investigation was that of Mrs Hendrickson who died in labour giving birth to her son in July 2008. \n\nHe died the next day after being deprived of oxygen during birth. \n\n'Deepest apologies'\n\nThe investigation found that Mrs Hendrickson, who had diabetes, was not cared for properly and that her child's heartbeat was not monitored properly.\n\nThe second case in the same year was the death of Alex Davey-Brady who was stillborn after his mother Liza was induced in September. \n\nThe investigation concluded he too was deprived of oxygen and the two midwives who supervised the birth were insufficiently trained.\n\nThe ombudsman also found failings in the death of Joshua Titcombe, who was just nine days old when he died of pneumococcal septicaemia in October of the same year.\n\nIt found that chances to save him were missed and that his death was not investigated quickly enough.\n\nNursing Director for the North, Gill Harris, said:\"It is important that mistakes like this don't happen again. \n\n\"We would like to express our deepest apologies for the distress caused to the families affected - many of the improvements recommended have already been implemented.\"\nTL;DR: Poor supervision of midwives led to the deaths of three babies and a mother at a Cumbria hospital, a report has found.\n\nArticle: By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter\n\nAs a member of the US girl group Fifth Harmony, she'd sold millions of records and scored global hits with the slinky R&B of Worth It and Work From Home.\n\nBut the band were burned out, forced into a punishing work schedule and recording songs they didn't believe in. \n\n\"It's overwhelming to have your whole, entire life planned for something you don't feel passionate about,\"Jauregui told the LA Times in 2017. \n\n\"You're not seeing your family, your friends. You're not doing anything for yourself. It was depressing, draining and sad.\"\n\nCamila Cabello was the first to quit, allegedly on bad terms. The rest of the band struggled through one last album before announcing an\"indefinite hiatus\"last March.\n\nAll five members have since released solo material, with Jauregui's fierce-yet-vulnerable Expectations among the best of the bunch; showcasing the 22-year-old's husky voice against a simple guitar riff.\n\nBut she only managed to record it after a confusing and painful period in the musical wilderness.\n\n\"The industry clouds your soul,\"Jauregui tells the BBC.\"They make you feel like you have to be a certain way to be accepted, and I got lost in that.\n\n\"I had been pushed a psyche [mindset] of what successful music sounded like - so I had this backwards concept of what I thought was good for me, commercially.\"\n\nThe situation became so bad that the musician stopped writing, and even listening to, music.\n\n\"Then, as soon as the group dissolved and we started to go our separate ways, it cleared a lot of blockages from my heart,\"she says.  \n\n\"I started getting back into music that I actually liked.\"\n\nShe delved into the albums that inspired her as a teenager - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, Songs In A Minor by Alicia Keys - and began to figure out her own sound.\n\n\"Last year was super-challenging in the sense of ripping away all the things that weren't me any more and allowing myself to come through that. \n\n\"I was like,'Do you know what? I have to pull back. I like more organic sounding things, I like live instruments, I like writing lyrics that come straight from the heart.'\"\n\nOne of the first songs she wrote in that frame of mind was Expectations, which quickly established itself as the perfect debut single. \n\n\"I went on tour with Halsey - and that was one of the songs I had in my setlist. When I sang it for the first time in Sao Paolo, it was completely unreleased [but] by the end of the song they were singing the words back to me. \n\n\"English isn't their first language in Brazil, so I was floored by the response. That's why I chose it.\"\n\nMighty Aphrodite\n\nJauregui started 2019 by following Expectations up with More Than That - a sassy, assertive takedown of a wannabe lover.\n\n\"You gon' have to come stronger than this liquor/ Wanna take me home, better be more convincing / It'll take more than that to get to me,\"she sings over a slick trap beat.\n\nHammering home her messages of feminine power and self-worth, Jauregui recreates Botticelli's iconic 15th Century painting The Birth of Venus in the artwork.\n\nThe video, meanwhile, sees her playing Aphrodite, who comes to earth and visits a strip club (stick with us here) in a celebration of womanhood.\n\n\"It's about taking that kind of rap video imagery and empowering the women who do this work,\"she explains.\n\n\"They're stripping, but each woman's spirit is captured in a way that's revering her strength and her sensuality.\"\n\nHaving dreamt up the video concept and cast the models, Jauregui found herself in awe of their athleticism.\n\n\"It was amazing. The number of hours they were doing these tricks and twirling and carving the pole. You'd think they'd be all oiled up - but they have to be completely dry, with chalk on their hands, so they can do their work. \n\n\"I was grateful we could capture that and really highlight them. They're the centrepiece of the video for me.\"\n\nAnd did she pick up any tips? \n\n\"Any tips?!\"she laughs heartily.\"Well, yeah, just by watching them.

Yet the Queen has yet to set foot in Dublin.\n\nA trip to Ireland has not been possible, for historical, political and security reasons. These are too numerous to mention and go back too far, but two incidents in the 1970s illustrate the depth of the more recent divisions. \n\nMountbatten\n\nAfter the Bloody Sunday killings by the British Army in Londonderry in 1972, the British Embassy in Dublin was burnt down. \n\nSeven years later, one of the Queen's relatives, Lord Louis Mountbatten, was killed by the IRA while holidaying on the Irish coast.\n\nIt is only since the turn of the century that the possibility of the Queen going to Dublin has been mentioned. The political climate has been changed by the bedding down of the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nAnglo-Irish relations have been transformed, mainly by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern when they were British and Irish prime ministers. Not only were they key players in the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, they had a great personal rapport.\n\nSuch was their friendship, few would have been surprised if they ended up going on holiday together. Given the long and deep historical difficulties between their respective countries, that was quite a feat.\n\nHowever, if the Queen's visit does go ahead next year, perhaps the history books will show that the current British prime minister David Cameron also played a crucial role.\n\nHis speech to the House of Commons about the recent Bloody Sunday report, and his acceptance of British Army wrongdoing on that day, went down extremely well in Dublin. At the same time, he helped to dispel some of the historic Irish antagonism to Tory prime ministers.\n\nHowever, the proposed landmark trip is not without its problems and sensitivities. Sinn Fein have already said they will be opposing it. Radical republican protest groups are likely to organise demonstrations.\n\nThe Irish government are also acutely aware that at a time when the country is battling an economic crisis, with people coping with pay cuts and job losses, any visit by the British Queen will have to be modest when it comes to pomp and ceremony.\n\nPrince Charles has visited the Irish Republic, and the Irish president Mary McAleese has met the Queen on a number of occasions in London and Belfast. That has helped to prepare the ground for the Dublin get-together.\n\n'Building bridges'\n\nThe best guess in terms of the timing is that it will be in April, May or June. President McAleese's term of office ends in November, and the months immediately before her departure are likely to be dominated by the election contest to decide her successor.\n\nOne of the themes of her presidency has been'building bridges', and she has been involved in a number of ground-breaking community projects, along with her husband Martin.\n\nThe building of a metaphorical bridge between Dublin Castle and Buckingham Palace, by welcoming the Queen to Ireland, would be a milestone in Anglo-Irish relations.\n\nIt would signal a maturing of the relationship between the two countries, maybe even something approaching a normalisation.\n\nHistorians would have a field day. \n\nAfter writing so much over the years about fighting, divisions and enemies, perhaps the next chapter in Anglo-Irish history will be entitled simply'neighbours'.\nTL;DR: In the spring of next year, the Queen may make one of the shortest but most significant journeys of her 57-year reign when she travels to Ireland.\n\nArticle: Jozsef Szajer, a top member of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party, was stopped by police after reports of a house party violating lockdown rules.\n\nProsecutors say he was found with drugs as he tried to flee the gathering, reportedly shinning down a drainpipe.\n\nHe apologised for\"a personal failing\".\n\nOn Friday he had pleaded parliamentary immunity but he is now under investigation - for both non-compliance with measures relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and violation of drug laws.\n\nThe European Parliament said the immunity rule only extended to an MEP's official duties, not to their private life.\n\nWhat happened on Friday?\n\nAt around 21:00 (20:00 GMT), prosecutors say, police were alerted by neighbours who complained about noise and potential lockdown breaches in an apartment located on Rue des Pierres in the centre of the Belgian capital.\n\nInside the flat, police found about 20 people, two of whom - not including Mr Szajer - invoked diplomatic immunity.\n\nMost of those present were men, some of whom were naked when police burst in, Belga news agency reports.\n\nThey were cautioned for having broken the lockdown rules.\n\nA passer-by who told police he had seen a man descending a drainpipe was able to identify him.\n\nThe man's hands were bloody and it is possible he was injured while fleeing. \n\n\"Narcotics were found in his backpack,\"a statement by prosecutors says.\"The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence where he identified himself as S. J. (1961) by means of a diplomatic passport.\"\n\nCriminal proceedings may only be brought if parliamentary immunity is waived, the statement adds.\n\nWhat had Mr Szajer to say about the incident?\n\nThe BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says Mr Szajer's sudden resignation as an MEP on Sunday surprised his political friends and foes alike. He had blamed\"increasing mental strain\"for the decision.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mr Szajer admitted he had attended the party on Friday but did not describe it. \n\n\"I didn't use drugs, I told the police on the spot I was willing to undergo an official test, but they didn't do one,\"he said. \n\n\"The police said an ecstasy pill was found. It was not mine, I don't know who planted it or how. I made a statement to the police about this.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that I broke the rules of assembly,\"he added,\"this was irresponsible on my part, and I will take the sanctions that come with it.\"\n\nBelgium's De Standaard daily says the usual fine for breaking the Covid rules on assembly is \u20ac250 (\u00a3224).\n\nJozsef Szajer's resignation, followed by his confession that he took part in what media have described as a\"gay orgy\", is a serious blow for Fidesz, which has governed Hungary for the past decade. \n\nMr Szajer was one of the founders of Fidesz in March 1988, and remains a close confidant of Prime Minister Orban. He has been an MEP for 16 years, for the past 11 as chief whip and vice-president of the European People's Party. \n\nHe has played a key role in keeping Fidesz inside the conservative political grouping, despite fierce criticism. He is married to Tunde Hando, former president of the National Judiciary Office, now a Constitutional Court judge. \n\nThe sex scandal is particularly embarrassing for a party which campaigns for traditional family values and recently proposed a law to ban gay adoption.\nTL;DR: An MEP from Hungary's ruling party, which is hostile to LGBT rights, has quit after he was caught attending what Belgian media describe as a gay sex party in Brussels on Friday.\n\nArticle: At almost 9,000km long, the Canada-US border is the longest in the world.\n\nMore than 300,000 people cross it every day.\n\nWhile most people surveyed reported good border-crossing experiences, about half are worried about how President Trump will affect travel.\n\nAngus Reid surveyed about 15,000 Canadians in January on their border experiences in 2016 in general, and their opinions on how the election will impact their travels. \n\nAlmost 86% said that their experience crossing into the US last year was good overall. They reported similar satisfaction with wait times, and their interactions with border agents.\n\nBut that rosy picture changes if you're a visible minority or young, the survey found. Among self-identifying visible minorities, the percentage reporting a poor experience rose from 14% to 25%. Young people under 35 also were more likely to have a bad experience, with about one in five rating their overall border crossing as poor.\n\nSince his inauguration in January, Mr Trump has made drastic changes to immigration policy, announcing that he will build a wall between the US-Mexico border, and promising\"extreme vetting\"measures to\"keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US\". \n\nThis has people nervous. The survey found that 48% of Canadians think Mr Trump will make travelling to the US worse, 49% either don't know or think he won't make a difference, and only 3% thought he would improve the border experience.\n\nVisible minorities were more likely to be pessimistic about what a Trump presidency might do for their travels: 57% said things will get worse, while only 36% didn't know or didn't think he'd have an impact.\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, visible minorities were also more likely to think Mr Trump would make things better, with 7% of people who self-identify as a visible minority believing the border experience would improve, compared to just 2% of non-visible minorities.\nTL;DR: A recent poll shows that Canadians are afraid of what Donald Trump's presidency will do to cross-border travel, especially if they are visible minorities.\n\nArticle: By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nA public review into the three person IVF technique has been broadly supportive, says the Department of Health. \n\nBut a number of technical and scientific details need to be finalised before the plans go before Parliament.\n\nThe move would be restricted to mitochondrial disease, affecting one in 6,500 UK babies born each year.\n\nThis may lead to muscle weakness, blindness, and heart failure. \n\nUsing the parents' sperm and eggs plus an additional egg from a donor woman should prevent such conditions, say scientists at Newcastle University.\n\nApproval details\n\nAn expert scientific panel has already suggested there is no evidence the procedure is unsafe but has asked for a number of further investigations to be carried out. \n\nThe government expects other details to be finalised in the next few months before the plans are legalised.\n\nA public consultation received nearly 2,000 responses.\n\nMinisters agreed that the regulatory body the Human Fertilisation Embryology Authority would consider each application from parents on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAnd any children born using the procedure would not be able to find out the identity of the mitochondrial donor.\n\nMitochondria are tiny, biological\"power stations\"that provide energy to nearly every cell of the body.\n\nAs mitochondria are passed down from mother to child, using an extra egg from a donor woman could give the child healthy mitochondria.\n\n'No excuse'\n\nHowever, it would also result in babies having DNA from two parents and a tiny amount (1%) from the donor as mitochondria have their own DNA.\n\nOpponents say it is unethical and could set the UK on a\"slippery slope\"to designer babies.\n\nDr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said:\"There is broad public support for making mitochondrial replacement therapy available to patients. \n\n\"There is now no excuse for the Government not to table regulations for debate as soon as Parliament returns this autumn, so that the HFEA can licence clinics to treat affected families without delay once it is satisfied that any risks are acceptable.\"\n\nSarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, said:'While we welcome the Government's decisions, we are disappointed by the time it has taken to reach this point in the process. \n\n\"A year ago, the Government promised a consultation in autumn 2013 which ultimately took place in March 2014. \n\n\"We note that the Government now aims to provide an update by early autumn 2014 -

But they haven't committed to it - and there are a range of good reasons why they might not.\n\nFirst, it would rile the universities. Labour has sought to soothe their concerns by promising university vice-chancellors it would make up the difference in their institutions' income. \n\nBut this is probably not a good deal for the universities, who have no guarantee that this money - which could eventually increase the usual measure of public spending by around \u00a32bn a year - would not be taken from their other state-backed budgets. Nor do they know how it would be distributed.\n\nWhy does this matter? Why care about academics? Well, because the vice-chancellors could - to use a word of the moment -\"weaponise\"it against Labour.\n\nRemember, the English universities are wily campaigners - they have won all their fights in recent years. \n\nThey could, for example, start querying Labour's ability to find the extra money while remaining inside its fiscal rules. Having the leaders of our top universities question Labour's spending plans would play into the party's terror about looking fiscally conservative. \n\nFears'not realised'\n\nSecond, the greatest fears surrounding the rise in tuition fees have not come to pass. Students cheerfully pay up, even poorer ones. And any concerns that the current student loan system is unaffordable also look rather overdone - I have explained why here.\n\nThird, the beneficiaries of a fee cut may not be who you think they are, because of the way that the loan system works. And it's not totally clear you would want to spend \u00a32bn a year helping them, especially since they would not feel the benefit for a few years. \n\nIf English students go to an English university their up-to-\u00a39,000 fees are covered by a student loan, which is a so-called\"income contingent\"debt. That means you only make repayments which you can afford to pay.\n\nSo graduates need repay none of their loans while they are earning less than a threshold, which now set at \u00a321,000. When they earn above that level, they repay a share of their wages over that benchmark to the Student Loans Company, a public company.\n\nOnce you finish paying off your loan, the repayments stop. But if you don't earn enough, you will not be asked to repay your loan in full. After 30 years, any outstanding debts are written off. \n\nSo it is a progressive policy - people who earn more pay more for their education. \n\nWho would benefit from lower fees?\n\nSo what would the effect of the changes be? I asked education economist Dr Gavan Conlon of London Economics to help with some maths to explain. \n\nDr Conlon estimates that around the top 60% of male graduate earners would roughly pay off a student loan with current tuition fee levels. Though someone at the 60% line would only just finish - such a person who started university last October would finish repaying their loan in 2047, as it got written off.\n\nIf you cut fees to \u00a36,000, that person - and men who earn more than them - are big winners. I reckon a typical person at that point in the income distribution might repay their fee loans three years sooner. \n\nA fee cut is also good for people who would not repay in full with fees at \u00a39,000, but would if fees were at \u00a36,000. Dr Conlon estimates that this group is men who are not in the top 60%, but are in the top 70%. It helps them, too - but by less. \n\nWhat about men who earn too little to repay their loans even at \u00a36,000? That bottom 30% would get no benefit whatsoever from a fee cut. \n\nThere's an interesting gender element to this, too. You'll notice I talked about men. The results are quite different for women. Dr Conlon estimates that, with fees at \u00a39,000, only the top 20% earning women repay their fees. At \u00a36,000, the top half will.\n\nThat is because, in brief, women earn less. \n\nThe general shape of the story is clear. Cutting tuition fees, counter-intuitively, helps better-off graduates the most, and it helps them in the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nThat is why spending money on a fee cut is not as simple as it seems. And why targeted measures might be a less complicated way to spend money in higher education, helping part-time and postgraduate students, for example. \n\nThat's an area where higher education policy is, by common consensus, still struggling.\nTL;DR: Labour is toying with the idea of fiddling with the English university tuition fees system, but doing so may have counterintuitive effects.\n\nArticle: The Brexit Party leader had just given a short speech in Newcastle as part of a tour of the country ahead of the European elections.\n\nA man was dragged away by a police community support officer and later seen in handcuffs. \n\nPaul Crowther, 32, from Throckley, Newcastle, said it was a \u00a35.25 Five Guys banana and salted caramel milkshake.\n\nMr Farage was campaigning in the North East ahead of polling day on Thursday.\n\nA Northumbria Police spokesperson said:\"A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of common assault and remains in police custody.\"\n\nMr Crowther said:\"I didn't know he [Mr Farage] was in town, I thought this is my only chance.\n\n\"It's a right of protest against people like him.\n\n\"The bile and the racism he spouts out in this country is far more damaging than a bit of milkshake to his front.\"\n\nStanding in handcuffs outside a branch of Waterstones, Mr Crowther said he did not regret his actions.\n\nHe denied an allegation that someone was cut, saying he only threw liquid on the politician.\n\nOf his milkshake, he added:\"I was quite looking forward to it, but I think it went on a better purpose.\"\n\nMr Farage is the the latest victim of a protest which has seen other European election candidates such as Ukip's Carl Benjamin and ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson suffer similar attacks.\n\nHe was heard to comment\"complete failure...

More recently, skateboarder Tony Hawk was filmed trying out a rival version, called Hendo, based on similar magnet-based technology.\n\n(The less said about non-hovering hoverboards the better.)\n\nBarcode registration plates, however, have made little progress beyond the odd April fool.\n\nLooking good\n\nThe tech world's current fascination with wearable tech was foreshadowed by Marty's talking jacket. \n\nAnd while today's clothes can't yet blow-dry us when we get wet, some fashion pioneers are experimenting with weaving electronics into their fabrics.\n\nSo, BTTF's message-flashing police hats have a parallel in CuteCircuit's tweet-displaying dresses, and Nike has even filed a patent for self-lacing shoes similar to those featured in the film.\n\nWhen it comes to our own bodily care, we can't yet exfoliate away the years with a Doc-style\"rejuvenation clinic\"facial.\n\nBut the 6.7 million botox injections and 1.2 million chemical peels carried out in the US last year suggest many are at least trying.\n\nRise of the robots\n\nBTTF's drones may only make fleeting appearances, but feel very\"of the moment\".\n\nMedia organisations, including the BBC, have started deploying camera-enabled aircraft to get new perspectives on the news - even if they might not be comfortable sending them into the kind of crowded situation USA Today's model films in the movie.\n\nDog-walking drones are also a real thing - at least if you believe everything you see on Vimeo and YouTube.\n\nAnother type of robot featured in the film is a mechanical car fuel attendant.\n\nThe Netherlands has already tested such a device a few years back, with the TankPitstop project, and Tesla is developing something similar for its electric vehicles.\n\nEntertainment\n\nWe've, thankfully, been spared Holomax sequels to Jaws.\n\nBut the film industry hasn't given up on the idea of 3D technologies - its latest pitch is a laser-projection system said to deliver\"brighter, crisper and clearer\"images.\n\nRather neatly, the innovation premiered in London earlier this month with Robert Zemeckis' latest film The Walk - he is, of course, also the director of the BTTF trilogy.\n\nBack to the Future II was closer to the mark when it came to home entertainment.\n\nA roll-up flatscreen shown in the McFlys' home is reminiscent of the flexible panels LG recently showed off at trade shows, which are rumoured to be featuring in commercial products soon.\n\nMeanwhile, voice-controlled televisions are already a reality thanks to smart TVs from Samsung and Sony as well as set-top boxes from Amazon and Apple.\n\nSmartglasses but no smartphones...\n\nWe get little hint at what Marty Jr sees via his hi-tech specs in the film, and their brand, JVC, is a much smaller force in consumer electronics than it once was.\n\nBut several of today's bigger names are betting on various forms of the tech, whether it's Microsoft's Hololens, Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual reality headset or version two of Google Glass.\n\nThe film's biggest miss, however, is arguably its lack of a smartphone.\n\nMarty Jr is even seen using an AT&T payphone at one point - all the more ironic since the company was first to offer the iPhone.\n\nIt's not that BTTF's filmmakers didn't envision a data-connected world - a Skype-like video chat program features at one point showing off not only the caller but also private details about them - but repeatedly communication occurs via a TV rather than a handheld display.\n\nLikewise, it's hard not to feel the film missed a trick by using a newspaper to warn of Marty Jr's impending arrest, instead of a touchscreen.\n\nStanley Kubrick's 2001 - released two decades earlier - had already featured its own\"newspads\".\n\nAnd a campaigner trying to restore Hill Valley's clock tower even seems to be using a tablet in one of Back to the Future II's other scenes.\n\nAn offline future\n\nIt's hard to be too critical, however, when you consider that the World Wide Web was only invented the same year that the film was released, and Tim Berners-Lee did not create its first browser until the following year.\n\nThat might explain why CD-Roms and their larger counterparts Laser Discs feature so prominently in piles of rubbish.\n\nSimilarly, in an age before email even got its name, it's perhaps not surprising that the film's futurists imagined we would want to fax from the pavement.\n\nBut even that does not quite explain why the McFlys' home has quite so many fax machines.\n\nOther hits and misses\n\nComputer-controlled ovens are still a relative rarity - although a robotic chef was indeed one of the highlights of a recent start-up showcase in San Francisco.\n\nSadly, pizza hydrators are still the stuff of pepperoni-fuelled dreams - and selfie-taking fridges have proved to be scant compensation.\n\nBTTF does score a hit with computer-controlled door locks - Yale was the latest to release such a product earlier this month.\n\nBut the idea of an Ortho-lev machine holding George McFly upside down seems like a rush of blood to the writers' heads - until you realise it was only included in the movie to disguise the fact that a different actor was portraying the character than in the first film.\nTL;DR: It's Back to the Future Day -

By the time it hit $10m in 2016 they held a family party in Moscow.\n\nIn July 2017 they went on holiday to Greece, unaware US federal agents investigating international money laundering were on their trail.\n\nThe FBI suspected BTC-e was involved in hiding funds stolen from the hack of another bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox. Cybercrime experts also thought it was being used by the mysterious Russian hacking group Fancy Bears. \n\nA warrant was issued for Alexander Vinnik's arrest and Greek police detained him on the beach, in front of his wife and children.  \n\nHis mother called Alexei Bilyuchenko, who was in a different resort. In a panic, he smashed his laptop, threw it into the sea and jumped on the next flight to Moscow.\n\nBillionaire with ties to Kremlin\n\nBack home in Novosibirsk, Mr Bilyuchenko decided to try to recoup his losses by setting up another exchange called Wex (World Exchange Services).  \n\nThe FBI had seized BTC-e's website but he still had the back-up servers and, via Wex, he was able to return investments to some BTC-e clients.\n\nAt this stage, according to the version of events he later told police, and which has been shared with the BBC, Alexei Bilyuchenko decided he needed a backer to offer some protection.\n\nHe says he was introduced to Konstantin Malofeyev, a Moscow-based billionaire, with strong ties to both the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church. \n\nMr Malofeyev, who made his fortune in investment banking, is currently under US and EU sanctions for alleged links to rebel fighters in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn his police statements Alexei Bilyuchenko says he was invited to Moscow several times to meet Mr Malofeyev in his offices in a high-end shopping plaza.\n\nThe topic of how much money Wex was generating allegedly figured large in their conversations, as did the question of what might have happened to the funds held by BTC-e until the FBI swooped. \n\n\"For several months Malofeyev demanded I show him the Wex cryptocurrency balances,\"Mr Bilyuchencko told police.\n\nMr Malofeyev strongly denies any connection to either Mr Bilyuchenko or Wex. \n\nWho were the men'from the security service'?\n\nBy summer 2018, trading on Wex was slowing down, and at the end of the year it stopped altogether. \n\nThe $450m worth of cryptocurrency it was holding vanished without trace. \n\nAngry clients began demanding their money back and one filed a complaint with police in Russia's Chuvashiya region.\n\nAlexei Bilyuchenko was summoned as a witness, and he told the police an extraordinary story.\n\nHe said he had actually lost control of Wex in the spring of 2018, several months before it officially collapsed.\n\nHe said that at a meeting in Konstantin Malofeyev's Moscow office he had been introduced to some men he understood were agents from the security service, the FSB. \n\nThey took him to a building used by the FSB, not far from the Bolshoi Theatre. They asked him about Wex and then took him to the luxury Lotte hotel near the Russian foreign ministry where he says he remained under guard all night.\n\nAccording to Mr Bilyuchenko, the next morning he was taken back to Mr Malofeyev's office, where it was strongly suggested he should move the funds held by Wex into\"an FSB fund\", which he agreed to, and, according to him, on his next visit to Moscow he transferred everything as requested.\n\nBack home in Novosibirsk, it began to dawn on him, he says. He had, he claims, been the victim of a scam and, rather than transferring the money into state coffers, he had actually been tricked into handing it over to Mr Malofeyev's associates.\n\nSince telling his story to the police Mr Bilyuchenko has gone into hiding. Private security guards now protect his home and he has declined to speak to the BBC or anyone else about Wex.\n\nBomb hoaxes and the missing millions\n\nSo is Alexei Bilyuchenko telling the truth?\n\nAlexander Terentiev, who heads a campaign group for defrauded investors, told the BBC he was not convinced. But others seem less sceptical. \n\nSince the end of November, courts, public buildings, metro stations and shopping centres in Moscow and St Petersburg have been paralysed by almost daily hoax bomb threats. \n\nAccording to reports in Russian media, several of the emailed warnings have included references to Wex's missing millions and to Mr Malofeyev. \n\nA statement issued via Mr Malofeyev's Tsargrad TV channel described the bomb threats as part of\"a campaign of discreditation\"against him.\n\n\"Neither Konstantin Malofeyev nor his companies have anything to do with the theft of Bitcoins, the Wex exchange, or its management,\"it said.\n\nMr Malofeyev has declined to speak to the BBC about the case and the FSB has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. \n\nMeanwhile, in Greece, two years after his dramatic arrest on the beach, Alexei Bilyuchenko's former business partner Alexander Vinnik is still in jail. \n\nThe US, Russia and France are all seeking his extradition. He has not seen his wife, now suffering from a brain tumour, for two years, \n\nHis lawyer Timofei Musatov told the BBC the former bitcoin multi-millionaire had been on a long hunger strike and was now a shadow of his former self. \n\nIllustrations by Tatiana Ospennikova\n\nFind out more about Russia and cryptocurrencies\nTL;DR: A Russian computer programmer involved in the collapse of a big cryptocurrency exchange says he was tricked into handing over its entire assets to fraudsters posing as FSB agents, according to documents obtained by BBC Russian.\n\nArticle: Dr Sarandev Bhambra, 25, was attacked with a machete by Zack Davies at a Tesco in Mold, Flintshire, in January. \n\nNeo-Nazi Davies, 26, from Mold, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years for attempted murder.\n\nDr Bhambra questioned whether the\"barbaric incident\"could have been prevented and called Davies a coward.\n\n\"He attacked me from behind and tried to behead me,\"dentist Dr Bhambra said outside court.\n\n\"By the grace of God I remained conscious and was able to defend myself.\n\n\"It is abhorrent that he has claimed that he tried to kill me in Lee Rigby's honour.

Its data are very reliable and the measurements we have match reality,\"said Prof Volker Liebig, the director of Earth Observation at the European Space Agency (Esa).\n\n\"We now have a very powerful tool to monitor the changes taking place at the poles,\"he told BBC News.\n\nThe Esa director delivered an update on the mission at London's Royal Society. The information was also being released here at the  \n          \n \n          European Geosciences Union (EGU)\n meeting in Vienna, Austria. \n        \n\nSeveral satellites have already detailed the  \n          \n \n          recent and rapid erosion of summer sea ice extent\n as the Arctic has warmed.\n        \n\nBut Cryosat's innovation has been to provide a means to get at a figure for ice volume - a far more significant number in terms of understanding the long-term viability of the ice.\n\nTo do this, the satellite carries one of the highest resolution synthetic aperture radars ever put in orbit.\n\nThe instrument sends down pulses of microwave energy which bounce off both the top of the ice and the water in the cracks, or leads, which separate the floes.\n\nBy measuring the difference in height between these two surfaces, scientists can, using a relatively simple calculation, work out the overall volume of the marine cover.\n\nThe Cryosat team, led from University College London, has spent the period since launch working through the satellite's measurements, validating and calibrating them against a number of independent observations.\n\nThese include data from plane-borne instruments, from direct on-the-ice assessments, and even from scientific sea-floor moorings that profile the ice floes as they pass overhead.   \n\n\"We can now say with good confidence that Cryosat's maps of ice thickness are correct to within 10-20cm,\"said Dr Seymour Laxon, from  \n          \n \n          UCL's Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM)\n.\n        \n\nTuesday's release shows a complete seasonal cycle, from October 2010, when the Arctic Ocean was beginning to freeze up following the summer melt, right through to March 2011, when the sea ice was approaching peak thickness. Cryosat found the volume (area multiplied by thickness) of sea ice in the central Arctic in March 2011 to have been 14,500 cubic kilometres.\n\nThis figure is very similar to that suggested by  \n          \n \n          PIOMAS (Panarctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System)\n, an influential computer model that has been used to estimate Arctic sea ice volume, and which has been the basis for several predictions about when summer sea ice in the north might disappear completely.\n        \n\nIn addition to the announcement on sea ice, the Cryosat team also published a digital elevation model (DEM) of Greenland.\n\nThe big island, too, has experienced some rapid changes of late and is losing tens of billions of tonnes of its ice cover to the ocean annually.\n\nThe DEM is a map of varying height, and the visualisation on this page incorporates a year's worth of data.\n\nFor Cryosat, it is another illustration of its capability. Radar satellites have traditionally struggled to discern the detail in the steep slopes and ridges that mark the edges of ice sheets, but the Esa spacecraft can recover far more information thanks to a special interferometric observing mode that uses two antennas.\n\n\"This is really the first demonstration of the interferometer in action,\"said  \n          \n \n          Prof Andrew Shepherd from Leeds University\n.\n        \n\n\"The DEM contains about 7.5 million data points, and we're pretty confident this will be the best elevation model for Greenland, by some margin. Our next step is to compare it to previous data to see how Greenland has changed.\"\n\nCryosat's principal investigator, Prof Duncan Wingham - formerly of UCL but now chief executive of the UK's National Environment Research Council - summed up:\"We have years of data to come, but I think it's quite clear that we will provide synoptic, accurate, Arctic-wide thickness; and that we will be able to determine the accuracy of the predictions of when the Arctic will be ice-free in Summer.  \n\n\"And I think it's also clear we can now sustain coverage of [ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland] right down to the coast.\"\n\nThe Cryosat update was timed to coincide with this week's  \n          \n \n          50th anniversary of UK activity in orbit\n.   \n        \n\nApril 1962 was the month Britain became a space-faring nation with the launch of its first satellite, Ariel-1.  \n\nAs part of the celebration, current capabilities and missions with strong UK interest  \n          \n \n          are being highlighted\n.\n        \n\nCryosat's map of Arctic sea ice thickness - April 2011\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on  \n          \n \n          Twitter\nTL;DR:  Europe's Cryosat mission is now watching the ebb and flow of Arctic sea ice with high precision. \n\n\n\nArticle: Customers flocked to social media complaining the retailer was\"fat-shaming\"women after they received Atkin bars with plus-sized orders.\n\n\"What are you trying to tell me Forever 21 - that I'm fat, lose weight?\"asked one angry customer on Twitter.\n\nThe retailer has responded, apologising for the\"oversight\"and insisting that all customers were sent the snack bars.\n\n\"From time to time, Forever 21 surprises our customers with free test products from third parties in their e-commerce orders,\"Forever 21 said in a statement.\n\n\"The freebie items in question were included in all online orders, across all sizes and categories, for a limited time and have since been removed. \n\n\"This was an oversight on our part and we sincerely apologise for any offence this may have caused to our customers, as this was not our intention in any way.\"\n\nSamantha Puc, the managing editor of comic news site The Beat, warned Forever 21 that it was sending\"a wildly dangerous message\"to customers who might have eating disorders. \n\nHowever, other users, who had received the diet bars with orders of clothing in smaller sizes, chided those who were upset on Twitter, saying they should\"pick their battles better\".\n\nForever 21 is no stranger to controversy.

The new interpretation includes audiovisual effects including a steam machine and is planned to be completed by the end of February, but work is already under way.\"\n\nAccording to the museum, women faced opposition as they took up their new roles - some people disapproved of women calling out station names saying it was\"unfeminine and immodest\".\n\nThey were also criticised for wearing men's breeches despite the fact some tasks were impossible or dangerous to do in a long skirt.\n\nUntil April 1915 women were paid two-thirds less than their male counterparts until the railway unions admitted women and the National Union of Railwaymen demanded that companies should pay women at least the minimum male wage for the job.\n\nAs the war progressed women took on the better paid but more hazardous posts of track maintenance platelayer, shunter and guard.\n\nThe position of railway police officer was opened in 1917.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1918 women were expected to hand their jobs back to the men they had replaced but many were retained and the number of women employed by the railways never fell to its pre-war level.\n\nThe wartime trailblazers were the first of hundreds of women to forge careers in the rail industry but they were far from the last.\n\nThe industry began to change as a result of the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act which made discrimination at work based on sex or marital status illegal. \n\nThe number of women management trainees rose from none in 1975 to 20 in 1981 and women were also accepted for driver training.\n\nMs Ashby said:\"From cleaning to signalling, women today play a key part in all aspects of railway work.\"", "prediction": "A database of 2,500 railway staff who died in World War I has been unveiled by the National Railway Museum.\n\nArticle: The UK government has confirmed it has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to people who suffered from the MMR vaccine.\n\nThe payouts were made to people who received the vaccine in the 1980s and 1990s and claimed to have suffered side effects, such as autism and bowel disease.\n\nHowever, the government said there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine caused these conditions.\n\nIt was also confirmed that a separate investigation into the possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism is ongoing.\n\nThe government has been criticised for not being transparent enough about the payouts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement:\"We have always maintained that the evidence does not support a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism, but we understand that some people may have concerns.\"\n\nIt added:\"We have a robust system in place to review and investigate claims of vaccine side effects and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\"\n\nIn 1998, a now-discredited study by Andrew Wakefield suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nThe study sparked widespread concern and led to a significant drop in vaccination rates in the UK.\n\nBut numerous subsequent studies have found no link between the vaccine and autism.\n\nThe government said it has paid out \u00a337.8m in compensation to people who claimed to have suffered side effects from the MMR vaccine.\n\nHowever, the Department of Health and Social Care added that the majority of these claims were made in the early 2000s and it is likely that many of them were not related to the vaccine.\n\nThe government said it has received over 900 claims and paid out in just under 700 cases.\n\nIt added that the payments were made without admitting liability and were made on a \"no-fault\" basis.\n\nThe government said it will continue to review and investigate claims of vaccine side effects and will provide further guidance on the issue.\nTL;DR: The UK government has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to people who claimed to have suffered side effects from the MMR vaccine.\n\nArticle: The 34-year-old was part of a three-strong team working on the new \u00a310 coin which is being released on Thursday.\n\nThe Royal Mint has announced that the new coin will be made of nickel-brass and will enter circulation on 28 June.\n\nThe change is part of a planned overhaul of the UK's coinage", "cleaned_prediction": "A database of 2,500 railway staff who died in World War I has been unveiled by the National Railway Museum.", "gt": "A database has been launched containing the details of 20,000 railway workers who died in World War I."}, {"input_prompt": "Your objective is to generate a concise and coherent summary of a given news article.

Their body is cooled from its normal temperature of 37C (98.6F) to just 18C (64.4F).\n\nThe patient is indistinguishable from someone who is actually dead. \n\nBut crucially the cold slows the body's processes offering a window for surgery before risk of brain damage.\n\nOnce surgery is complete, the patient is warmed up and their heart restarted with a defibrillator.\n\n\"There is no room for error or failure really - that would be catastrophic,\"says Dr Elefteriades.\n\n\"It is the most fascinating technique to which I have ever been exposed in medicine and each time, it seems a miracle to me that it works.\"\n\nDouble-edged sword\n\nFor heart surgeons like Dr Elefteriades, operating on a beating heart presents obvious challenges. Some operations are difficult, if not impossible, if the heart cannot first be isolated and stopped. \n\nSurgeons can and do provoke cardiac arrest, stopping the heart, but under usual circumstances, they rely upon heart-lung bypass machines to replace its function for the duration of surgery.  \n\nThis technique is now so commonplace that it is almost considered routine. \n\nBut sometimes heart-lung bypass is not an option and induced hypothermia is now proving a powerful alternative.\n\nThe technique of extreme cooling is fascinating. It takes the moment of death and smears it out. By  putting the whole body in a sort of metabolic slow motion it also slows the process of dying, buying clinicians and patients precious time.\n\nBut it is a double-edged sword. Cooling to these extremes is about as likely to kill you as it is to cure you and these hazards need to be negotiated.      \n\nThis has led to deep hypothermia becoming less fashionable as a technique until recently, when its potential to enable seemingly impossible operations became clear.\n\nLeading researchers can now use induced hypothermia to offer life-saving surgery in previously inoperable frontline medical situations, such as neonatal brain injuries, cardiac arrest and major traumas.\n\nLife-saving operation\n\nThis is the case for 59-year-old Esmail Dehzbod, who needed complicated repairs to the great blood vessels immediately surrounding his heart to prevent the fatal rupture of an aneurysm of his aorta. \n\nLife-saving surgery was absolutely necessary, but in Mr Dehzbod's case, once the function of his heart had been stopped, it could not be replaced.\n\nBecause of the position of the aneurysm, surgeons would need to cut off the blood supply to his brain, which, in a traditional bypass operation, would starve it of oxygen and lead to brain damage. \n\nInstead, Dr Elefteriades chose to stop Mr Dezhbod's heart by inducing hypothermia.\n\nThis would leave him without a circulation and indistinguishable from someone dead but crucially, would slow his metabolic process and allow time for the difficult repair before the dying process became irreversible.\n\nMr Dezhbod expressed his fears ahead of undergoing such a high-risk operation.\n\n\"I'm concerned about my children. I cannot mention reality because it will hurt them. This morning I hugged them and kissed them and mentioned everything will be ok - but it will be a risk too.\"\n\nThese remarkable feats of surgery are a race against the clock of life. \n\nThe risks are huge but for Mr Dezhbod there was no better alternative. And remarkably, his operation proved successful and he was successfully revived.\n\n\"I have pain - it is not easy - but I know it will be a good end and I know that my problem has been solved.\"\n\nMiraculous recovery\n\nMedical breakthroughs often begin with an accident.\n\nSome 11 years ago, Anna Bagenholme, a 29-year-old skier, fell through ice covering a ravine in Norway. \n\nHer heart stopped for more than three hours and her body temperature dropped to 13.7C (56.7F).  \n\nThis is the longest and coldest cardiac arrest on record and that she survived at all is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nThis case alters the very concept of life and death and reminds us that death itself is not an event but a process. A process that might be manipulated to our advantage.\n\nThe idea of extreme cooling to save lives might appear simple but as a technique, it is as powerful as it is enigmatic - and it has the potential to bring hope where historically there has been none.\n\nDr Kevin Fong presents Horizon: Back From The Dead on BBC Two, on Monday 27 September at 2100 BST.\nTL;DR: Heart surgeons are using extreme cooling to allow them to stop a patient's heart long enough to carry out surgery and then revive them.\n\nArticle: A room at Sheffield Children's Hospital has been transformed into a virtual world of seas and woods filled with creatures with which patients can interact.\n\nIt is hoped the augmented reality technology will occupy children during procedures such as wound dressing.\n\nResearch has shown reducing stress hormones improves wound healing.\n\nThe game was developed by the hospital's art programme Artfelt and designers Megaverse.\n\n'Fear of pain'\n\nChildren use a tablet to navigate different calming environments. Artwork on the walls becomes the backdrop for the game and a soothing soundtrack fills the room.\n\nCharlotte Wright, senior clinical psychologist at the hospital, said feedback had been positive from patients and staff.\n\n\"Procedural anxiety is usually due to a fear of pain, or memories of similar negative experiences,\"said Dr Wright.\n\n\"This can make repeated dressing changes following a burn increasingly distressing for a child, their family and our team.\n\n\"Negative experiences in hospital can hinder a patient's ability to cope with their burn injury and can increase wider symptoms of anxiety and trauma.\"\n\nSeven-year-old Marnie-Jayne Smith is being treated at the hospital after being burnt in the family kitchen in Goole, East Yorkshire.\n\nHer mother Samantha said:\"At the start she was very brave with the dressings, but as the days have gone by you can see she's been getting nervous on the journey and going quiet.\n\n\"The last few times she just didn't want to do it.\n\n\"She absolutely loved the penguin game.

His guard was also killed.\n\nPolice in Karachi say they have arrested about a dozen suspects in connection with the murders.\n\nSchools were shut and most businesses closed on Tuesday in the port city of more than 16 million people. \n\nThe BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi says the city remains in the grip of fear, with reports of gunmen continuing to patrol several neighbourhoods, although security forces are now beginning to regain control. \n\nMeanwhile, thousands of angry mourners chanted slogans as Haider's coffin, draped with the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) party banner, was brought out for his funeral in central Karachi. \n\nAlthough the MQM leadership has now appealed for restraint to end the cycle of revenge attacks, our correspondent says this may have come too late as the death toll continues to rise. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, senior members of the MQM vowed to retaliate, and gunmen soon appeared on the streets targeting civilians, while rioters attacked property and vehicles. \n\nOur correspondent says most victims of the mob violence were from the Pashtun community.

He had signed up to fight in the war and was on leave from the trenches.\n\n\"He was the most important man in the world to me, I loved every inch of him, and we were the apples of his eye; I really do think he worshipped us,\"she said.\n\n\"My brother and I were in school and when we came home we had such a shock - daddy was there.  He held the pair of us in his arms, hugged us, and ruffled our hair. I think he was excited to see how much we'd grown.\n\n\"We didn't want to know anything about the war, we just wanted to have him home forever, but of course, that wasn't to be.\"\n\nIt was not to be because just a month after his final visit home, Mrs Barron's father was killed in action at the battle of Cambrai in France.\n\nBreakdown fears\n\nUnable to cope alone with her four children, Mrs Barron's mother split up the family.\n\nMrs Barron never lived at home again. \n\nIn 2010, as well as returning to the family home in Blackwood, Mrs Barron was able to visit Bourlon Wood where her father was killed.  She herself died four months later. \n\nAccording to WW1 historian Dr Gerry Oram, Mrs Barron's experience represented wider fears about a breakdown in society.\n\n\"Even at the time the government was extremely worried about the loss of so many fathers,\"he said.\n\n\"But unfortunately their primary concern was about the wider sociological consequences, rather than the impact it had on individual children and families.\n\n\"There was a hue and cry about the lack of disciplinarian father-figures and what was perceived as the resultant rise in juvenile delinquency.  \n\n\"Whether these fears were founded or just a response to the increased press and police attention of WW1, what is termed a moral panic, is still a huge debate in history and criminology.\"\n\nBut while so many needs were left unaddressed, Dr Oram argues the experience of WW1 did bring some tangible benefits for young people.\n\n\"Even in 1914 the guidelines were that children should receive education until they were 14, but in practice there were so many exemptions to this that it was meaningless,\"he said.\n\n\"And with the shortage of labour brought about by war the situation became even worse.\n\n\"When he brought the 1918 Education Act before parliament, chairman of the board of education, H.A.L. Fisher, noted'between the start of the war and 1917, 600,000 children had been put prematurely - yet legally - to work'.  \n\n\"In areas like Wales, with labour-intensive industries, doubtless the situation was even worse. \n\n\"As a result of the act, after 1918 there is a focus on not only education, but also on improving nutrition and health-care through the school system.  \n\n\"But even this was borne of the experience of needing a healthy workforce in order to wage total war, rather than through concern for the individual child.\"\n\nDr Amy Brown, director of child and public health at Swansea University, believes modern examples prove how different life could have been for the children of WW1.\n\n\"The only comparable disasters you can point to in modern times are 9/11 and the tsunami, and for both of those, studies show that the enormous counselling effort which was put in place has enabled the child victims to address their grief and go on to develop as well as could have been expected under the circumstances,\"she said.\n\n\"It would have been a mixed blessing to grow up in somewhere like Wales during WW1.\n\n\"The close-knit community spirit would certainly have helped, but the'stiff upper lip' attitude, along with the fact that so many people were in the same boat, would have discouraged children from talking about it and resolving their feelings.\n\n\"In particular very small children have a tendency to blame themselves, and wrongly associate unrelated events, so unless they're told otherwise they'll feel as though their father died because they were naughty.\"\n\nShe argues that the failure to address individual emotional needs could have had incalculable consequences in the decades which followed.\n\n\"You'd have seen two distinct waves; firstly the older children, whose grief would have struck immediately, and then several years later the children who'd been very young at the time, and whose anger and loss only developed as they grew older.\n\n\"Under those circumstances it would be entirely predictable to see a spike in alcoholism, domestic violence and other crime amongst the cohort in the years that followed.\"\n\n'Lost generation'\n\nDr Oram agrees that, whilst more study is needed in the area, there could indeed be historical evidence to bear this out.\n\n\"We talk of a lost generation in terms of the men who were killed, but it's equally true to think of the next generation having also been lost,\"he said.\n\n\"A generation from broken families, with incomplete educations, tried to grieve as they had the additional responsibility of becoming the bread-winners thrust upon them.\n\n\"There's been little serious research done on the matter, but I'd say it's entirely reasonable to make a case that many of the social ills of the 1920s and 30s which have been blamed on the depression, could also be attributed in part to the aftermath of the unbelievable trauma that generation had lived through as children.\"\nTL;DR: About 35,000 Welshmen gave their lives in battle during World War One, but while they are commemorated each year, the estimated 80,000 children in Wales who were left without fathers are often forgotten.\n\nArticle: The president said this would put an end to the\"war on coal\"and\"job-killing regulations\".\n\nThe Energy Independence Executive Order suspends more than half a dozen measures enacted by his predecessor, and boosts fossil fuels.\n\nBusiness groups have praised the Trump administration's move but environmental campaigners have condemned it.\n\nOutside the White House, a few hundred protesters gathered to vent their displeasure at the executive order.\n\nInside, the president was flanked by coal miners as he signed the order, saying:\"My administration is putting an end to the war on coal. \n\n\"With today's executive action I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, he vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate deal agreed in December 2015.\n\nWhat is Mr Trump's order changing?\n\nPresident Trump takes a very different approach to the environment from Mr Obama.

His opponents agree the new order will be a job creator - but they'll be jobs for lawyers, not in the coal fields. \n\nFront and centre is practical action on the Clean Power Plan (CPP), the Obama project to cut fossil fuels from energy production. Although it has long been tied up in the courts, the new administration will leave it to fester there while they come up with a much weaker replacement.\n\nThere will also be new, less restrictive rules on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and more freedom to sell coal leases from federal lands. \n\nPresident Trump is signalling a significant change in the widely held philosophy that CO2 is the enemy, the main driver of climate change. \n\nUS environmentalists are aghast but also enraged. They will be queuing up to go to court.

Genomic testing of cancer is generally a difficult and expensive option accessible to only a few. \n\nBut the university says what is different here, is that this test is comprehensive, practical and affordable - a few hundred pounds rather than in the thousands. \n\nIt is about to be piloted by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with health boards across the UK and internationally also in talks about bringing this tiny but potentially revolutionary test to a hospital near you.\nTL;DR: Scientists at Glasgow University have developed a cancer testing technique that they say could transform the way we treat the disease.\n\nArticle: On Wednesday English Heritage published a list of sites of industrial heritage most at risk due to neglect and decay.\n\nIt includes Ditherington Flax Mill, in Shrewsbury, and Chatterley Whitfield Colliery in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nBirmingham's grade II* listed gas retort house on Gas Street, declared\"at risk\"in 2010, has been removed from this year's report.\n\nIt follows years of maintenance by owners Ashtenne.\n\nSince the company bought the property eight years ago, as part of a portfolio, it has completed structural work to walls and the replacement of roof coverings.\n\nA continuing maintenance regime has also been set up.\n\nEnglish Heritage said it was convinced the immediate future of the city centre building was now secure.\n\nDating back to 1818, three years after the Battle of Waterloo, the retort house is believed to be both the first and the last remaining of Birmingham's gasworks.\n\n'Generating income'\n\nDr Sarah Lewis, from English Heritage, said that finding a new use for industrial buildings was the key to protecting them for future generations.\n\nThe retort house is currently empty and on the market, but its owners are in negotiation with a company considering turning it into a gym and creche.\n\nOne option is to use\"pod-like\"structures that would not affect the physical structure of the listed building.\n\nDr Lewis said that generating income from a historic building also meant owners were more likely to invest in them.\n\n\"The retort house's location means it's got a decent outlook for commercial re-use.

He had taken the drugs MDMA and another drug known as Flakka.\n\nThe drugs dramatically altered his behaviour, and he became aggressive with a friend.

which accounts for more than 90% of the country's export revenues.\n\nAs prices tumbled in the past months - from $115 (\u00a369) a barrel in June 2014 to below $50 last month - the country's GDP took a nosedive.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the economy will contract 10% this year and a further 6% in 2016.\n\nPresident Maduro has been pressing the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) - of which Venezuela is a member - to decrease production and push barrel prices up to at least $88.\n\nHowever, most Opec countries are interested in maintaining prices relatively low, so as to disincentive shale-gas projects.\n\nCaracas is bracing itself for oil prices to stay low. \n\nLast week, the National Assembly approved the 2016 budget which predicts a price of $40 per barrel next year.\n\nShortages and queues\n\nFor the past two years, going to supermarkets in Venezuela has been a time-consuming affair.\n\nA study by polling firm Datanalisis suggests that Venezuelans spend on average five hours per week buying groceries and visit up to four different stores to find products.\n\nOutside each major store, there are long queues and it takes hours for customers to get inside.\n\nChronic shortages of a number of products mean many have to go home empty-handed. \n\nThe hardest items to get hold of are the 42 staples the prices of which the government controls. Among them are milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil.\n\nMoreover, the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimates that there is a shortage of 70% of medication in most pharmacies across the country.\n\nFood companies complain that with regulated prices, some items are just not profitable to produce. \n\nThe government accuses producers of deliberately stockpiling products in order to drive prices up.\n\nVenezuelan-based broadcaster Telesur recently alleged that the shortages were a\"concerted effort by the opposition to create psychological distress in the country ahead of elections\".\n\nInflation\n\nWith shortages and queues, prices for essential goods are skyrocketing in the black market, driving up the cost of living.\n\nThe IMF predicts annual inflation of 159% in Venezuela this year - the highest in any country in the world. In 2016 it could be upwards of 200%, according to the Fund.\n\nVenezuela has not released any official inflation data this year, but President Maduro recently stated that figure for 2015 was likely to be 85%.\n\nThe government tries to tackle rising inflation with price controls; recently it fixed the price for a carton of 30 eggs at 420 bolivares.\n\nBut not all sellers stick to the fixed prices. Consumers reported paying almost three times as much on the black market, according to Huevo Today (Egg Today), a Twitter account on which Venezuelans share information on the prices of eggs.\n\nExchange rate\n\nVenezuela has three official exchange rates and an illegal black market rate.\n\nThe first two are used for importing goods which the government considers essential, such as food, medicine or household items. The third one is for Venezuelans who do not have the authorisation to buy dollars at the preferential rates.\n\nBut the black market rate is the one which many Venezuelans use as it is hard to get approval to exchange money at the official rates.\n\nThe disparity between the first rate and that of the black market is enormous. One dollar will buy you 6.3 bolivares at the lowest official rate, while on the black market it will fetch a whopping 800 bolivares, according to the widely used website DolarToday.com website. \n\nThe government introduced currency controls in 2003 to stem the flow of capital out of the country, but instead they have been a driving factor in pushing up inflation.\n\nImporting goods can be prohibitively expensive and companies are forced to find local alternatives.\n\nFor 10 months, fast food chain McDonald's replaced its French fries with yuka fries - made with local cassava - because importing potatoes had become too dear.\n\nFrench fries only returned to its menu last month when McDonald's finally managed to source potatoes locally.\n\nLiving standard\n\nOne of the proudest achievements of Chavismo - as the politics of the late President Hugo Chavez and his successor in office Mr Maduro are known - is its record in reducing poverty and inequality.\n\nPoverty levels were halved between 2003 to 2011 and Venezuela's Gini co-efficient, which measures inequality, improved greatly.\n\nSocial programmes sponsored by the government helped boost real income, but many fear that in a recession some of those gains are at risk of being reversed.\n\nA recent study by three Venezuelans universities suggested that poverty had already increased massively. The study suggested 73% of the population now lived in poverty - up from 27% in 2013.\n\nThe government dismissed the study, saying that not only had poverty not risen but that extreme poverty had fallen in 2015. \n\nOfficials also said that unemployment had fallen to a historic low of 6.7%.\nTL;DR: Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday to elect all 167 members of the National Assembly amid tension caused by the country's worsening economic decline.\n\nArticle: Elsa Salama was taken by her father Tamer Salama while she and her mother were visiting his relatives in 2011. \n\nElsa's mother Naomi Button, from Leeds, has not seen her since.  \n\nMr Justice Mostyn said Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick should consider what steps can be taken.\n\nMs Button was forced to return to England alone and thinks Elsa, now 12, has been living with Salama's mother in Egypt.\n\nShe launched family court litigation in London in a bid to get her daughter back.\n\nSalama, who returned to England without Elsa and is now living in Manchester, was jailed in January 2012 for breaching family court orders to arrange his daughter's return to England or to reveal where she was.\n\nBut a High Court judge ordered his release in December 2013.\n\nThe judge currently overseeing the family court litigation believes police should examine Salama's conduct.\n\nMr Justice Mostyn said:\"It seems to me that the father cannot be further punished for his contempt in continuing to refuse to reveal the whereabouts of Elsa and to cause her to return to England and Wales.\n\n\"It ought to be incumbent on the prosecuting authorities to consider criminal proceedings against him for at least two offences, namely conspiracy to commit (an) offence under section 2 of the Child Abduction Act 1984 and perjury.\n\n\"I shall direct that a copy of this judgment is to be sent to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police for her to consider what steps in this regard should be taken.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

demanded a recount, saying Mr Maduro was now\"even more loaded with illegitimacy\". \n\nHe said there were more than 300,000 incidents from Sunday's poll that would need to be examined.\n\nAnnouncing

supporters set off fireworks and blasted car horns. Opposition voters banged pots and pans in protest.\n\nIn a victory speech outside the presidential palace, Mr Maduro, wearing the colours of the Venezuelan flag, told crowds that the result was\"just, legal and constitutional\".\n\nHe said his election showed Hugo Chavez\"continues to be invincible, that he continues to win battles''.\n\nMr Maduro said he had spoken to Mr Capriles on the phone, and that he would allow an audit of the election result.\n\nHe called for those who had not voted for him to\"work together\"for the country.\n\nBut Mr Maduro's margin of victory was far narrower than that achieved by Chavez at elections last October, when he beat Mr Capriles by more than 10%.\n\nAlmost immediately one member of the National Electoral Council who does not have government sympathies called on the authorities to carry out a recount by hand, a call later echoed by Mr Capriles himself.\n\nAt Mr Capriles' campaign headquarters the mood was sombre, as his supporters watched the results on television.

She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since.\n\nHer father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family.\n\nWhat are women's rights in the UAE? \n\nAshitha Nagesh, BBC News\n\nWomen in the UAE are allowed to drive, vote, work, and own and inherit property, making the country the second-best in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) for gender equality, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nBut, to put this in context, the Mena region had the lowest score of all the regions. The UAE was ranked 120th in the world out of 153.\n\nThere are still aspects of a woman's personal life in the country that are controlled by a male\"guardian\"- often a spouse or other male relative. Although the UAE isn't as strict as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women still need their guardian's permission in order to get married. Divorce is also much harder for women; men don't need permission but women have to apply for a court order. And while the UAE does have an anti-discrimination law, sex and gender aren't included in its protected categories.\n\nSome laws have changed in the last few years, at least on the surface. An explicit permission for domestic violence was removed from the penal code in 2016. The requirement in the personal status law for women to\"obey\"their husbands was revoked in 2019, and the law was amended to make its language more gender-neutral. And last March a new law allowing women access to protection orders - such as restraining orders - came into effect.\n\nHowever, the new law defines domestic violence as abuse or threats that\"exceed [an individual's] guardianship, jurisdiction, authority or responsibility\", meaning it's ultimately down to judges to decide whether men have gone beyond their\"authority\"or not. In practice, protections for abuse victims are still weak.\n\nSheikh Mohammed has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut he has faced severe criticism over the treatment of Princess Latifa and her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children.\n\n\"There are no charges. It's pure punishment,\"Matthew Hedges, the British academic jailed for spying in the UAE in 2018, told the BBC when asked about the Princess Latifa case.\n\n\"There's no one looking out for her.

She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock.\n\nIn the messages, she detailed how:\n\nPrincess Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.\n\nThey said they released the messages out of concern for Princess Latifa's safety.\nTL;DR: The United Nations has said it will raise the detention of Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nArticle: Police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters at a march called by the main pro-Kurdish party, the HDP.  \n\nA number of areas in the south-east have been put under curfew as security forces battle Kurdish PKK militants.  \n\nViolence has surged after a ceasefire broke down earlier this year.\n\nThe protesters had assembled to voice opposition to the curfew imposed in the city's Sur district for almost two weeks.\n\nIt was imposed days after prominent pro-Kurdish lawyer Tahir Elci was shot dead in Diyarbakir during a battle between police and unidentified gunmen in which two policemen also died.\n\nA ceasefire between the army and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) collapsed in July and dozens have since been killed in violence in the south-east.\n\nTurkish jets have also bombed PKK bases in northern Iraq, with the army also launching a ground operation. \n\nMany Kurds were also angered by Turkey's failure to help Kurdish fighters in the battle for Kobane in northern Syria in June.\n\nIn the run-up to November's parliamentary poll, the HDP accused Turkey's governing AK Party and intelligence services of orchestrating more than 400 attacks on its offices.\nTL;DR: Two protesters have died in the south-eastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir in a clash between police and Kurdish demonstrators over a curfew imposed as part of a security crackdown.\n\nArticle: By Ruth AlexanderMoney Box, BBC Radio 4\n\nBut now one man has successfully claimed back the cost of his time from a firm which called him when he had specifically asked them not to.  \n\nRichard Herman from Middlesex felt like he was being hounded by calls and texts from companies telling him they could help him claim compensation after an accident or claim back money spent on mis-sold payment protection insurance, or PPI as it's known. \n\nHe has not had an accident and he has never taken out PPI.\n\nAnd he is also registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), which should stop unwanted sales calls.\n\nSo he decided to take action.\n\nTime and electricity\n\nBack in July, Mr Herman answered a call from an overseas call centre inviting him to make a PPI claim, he decided to stay on the line. \n\nHe answered the caller's questions until he was eventually passed through to a UK operation, called PPI Claimline, and told them he wanted to be taken off their sales list.\n\n\"I said to them, you need to stop calling me and, I said, if you keep calling me, I'll charge you \u00a310 a minute for my time to be talking to you,\"Mr Herman said, speaking to Radio 4's Money Box programme.\n\n\"I presumed that would be the end of it, but to my astonishment they called me again.\"\n\nDuring the second call - which came only two days later - Mr Herman waited 19 and a half minutes to be put through to the UK operation, to confirm that it was the same company as before, and to explain that he was now charging for his time.\n\nSo, when he got off the phone, he sent an invoice for \u00a3195 to PPI Claimline.\n\nAt first, he got no response. So Mr Herman sent the invoice again, this time by recorded delivery. PPI Claimline then wrote to him.\n\nThe company said it itself did not cold call, but it purchased introductions from other marketing companies including AAC, a UK company based in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, which uses the overseas call centre that had first called Mr Herman and passed him on to PPI Claimline. \n\nThe company said there was no record of Mr Herman's number in its database or that of any of its partner companies.\n\nBut Mr Herman had recorded the phone calls. So, stepping up his consumer assertiveness another gear, he filed a case in the small claims court. \n\nAnd that seemed to do the trick and the case was settled before it went to court. \n\nAAC, the company which had called Mr Herman on behalf of PPI Claimline, paid him \u00a3195 for his time and electricity, as well as his \u00a325 court costs.\n\nBreaking the law\n\nIt has been a cathartic experience for Mr Herman:\n\n\"It cheered me up to think that actually instead of being the victim of these calls I can actually defend myself against them to put the boot onto the other foot.\"\n\nBoth PPI Claimline and AAC declined to be interviewed by the BBC, but issued statements saying they are sorry that Mr Herman was called after he had asked for the calls to stop.\n\nThey say they only contact people who have opted in to receiving marketing calls, and they say Mr Herman had done so via a website he visited, which requires you to tick or untick a box to agree to be contacted by other companies. Mr Herman says he has not.\n\nBut even if he had, AAC is still breaking the law in this case, according to John Mitchison from the Telephone Preference Service. \n\n\"If Mr Herman had given specific consent for a named company to contact him, then that would have overridden TPS, but it would have to have been as blatant as that.\n\n\"General third party opt-in does not override TPS. The company should have been screening against TPS. It's a legal requirement to do that.\"\n\nIf you are registered with the TPS, and receive a cold call, you can complain to the TPS who will do a first round of investigations and pass the company's details on to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).\n\nBut the ICO has not been doing enough to stop rogue companies, according to Mr Mitchison:\n\n\"They haven't made any serious enforcement action for quite some time. At the beginning of this year, the ICO were given increased powers.\n\n\"They can now enforce a civil monetary penalty of \u00a3500,000, but they haven't done anything in the area of the TPS as yet.\n\n\"It's very frustrating. We obviously receive a huge number of complaints each month and we receive telephone calls from people that are being deluged by this type of call - particularly in the area of PPI and accident claims.\"\n\nOfcom figures show that complaints about cold calls trebled in the first half of this year, with nearly 10,000 complaints lodged in July alone.\n\n'Wry smile'\n\nBut the ICO is taking the problem of nuisance calls seriously according to its director of operations, Simon Entwhistle. \n\n\"In the past five or six years, we've taken action against 19 different companies for making calls that breach the electronic communications regulations,\"he said. \n\n\"The power to fine has only been in force for the last year. We have issued our first notice of intent to fine someone and the fines are totalling over \u00a3250,000.\n\n\"That's actually for people who've been sending spam texts, but these people don't just send one medium\u2026they send several different mediums.\"\n\nAnd what does he think of Mr Herman's success in taking matters into his own hands?\n\n\"It raised a wry smile. I think the people that make these calls are a nuisance and it's really good to see the public joining in the fight back against them.\"\n\nAnd other sales companies would probably do well to take Mr Herman's details off their databases, because he's ready for their call: \n\n\"I continue to receive further telemarketing calls, albeit from other companies. And I say to them every time now, that I will charge them \u00a310 a minute if they call again. \n\n\"I would like to think that it will help other people because every friend and family member I speak to all feels very under the cosh of these telemarketing companies.\"\n\nAAC of Bishop's Stortford is not connected to AAC Direct of Cardiff.\n\nListen to the full report on Money Box on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, 27 October at  Listen again via the Radio 4 website or the Money Box download.\nTL;DR: Complaints about unsolicited calls and texts from sales and marketing companies have reached an all-time high.\n\nArticle: By Sue PazBBC News\n\nChristmas displays are a staple of many a High Street during the festive season. Alongside the more traditional sights rooted in the nativity and fairytales are the more unusual themes of sparkly sprouts, llamas and naughty polar bears.\n\nBut the road to success starts not on 1 December, but far, far earlier.\n\nMark Neilly, senior creative project manager at Hello Flamingo, which specialises in window display design for firms like Habitat and Selfridges, said UK retailers start planning in January.\n\n\"Christmas window and in-store schemes are normally the biggest projects of the year for brands and retailers, and it is where most visual merchandising and marketing budgets are allocated to,\"he explains.\n\nRetailers often take a cue from the\"world class and innovate\"displays showcased in New York City, drawing inspiration from the exteriors of stores like Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\nAt the Fenwick department store in Newcastle, they are already\"well on the way with themes and creative concepts for 2019\", says its head of creative, Paul Baptiste.\n\n\"Theatre and storytelling [is] at the heart of what we do,\"he says.\n\n\"The window displays create memories for generations of our communities and they will always have an important place in each of our stores.\"\n\nThis year, scenes from Raymond Briggs's classic, The Snowman, fill the window. \n\nIt is a celebration of the story's 40th anniversary and features some of the film's most well-known moments, including the ice-skating snowmen and the flight around the globe.\n\nDrawing on fairytales and well-known stories is a tried and tested route, but every year brings with it the desire to come up with something fresh.\n\nEven with 160 years of Christmas display experience behind them, Harrods in London tries to do something different with their 27 windows.\n\n\"Every year we face the challenge of reinventing the magic of Christmas in a fun, imaginative way while staying true to the traditions of the season,\"says the shop's creative visual director, Alex Wells-Greco.\n\n\"A big part of our inspiration has been the idea of festive feasting, something we also celebrated in a 1950s window display, which featured a giant Christmas cake, and a number of miniature chefs.\n\n\"[This year] we've even erected an 8ft Christmas tree on Hans Crescent, covered in sparkling Brussels sprouts and embellished lobsters, and topped with a glitzy champagne bottle.\"\n\nOthers favour a more immersive approach.\n\nAt Castle Gardens in Sherborne, Dorset, the display features music and smells, and is all about\"tantalising the senses\", says director Louise Burks.\n\nThis year's display features a\"unicorn dreamland\", a 1980s-themed section, llamas, pom-poms and Frida Kahlo embroidered cushions.\n\nIzzy Pilcher painstaking hung slinky spring toys and suspending Rubik's Cubes from the ceiling, as well as making a wall of shiny tinsel.\n\n\"It's a tactile area and we want visitors to touch everything, really be absorbed in it,\"she says.\n\n\"But it's a weekly job just to re-hang and untangle them.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nFancy advent calendars - rip-off or festive fun?\n\nMulled wine... in a slow cooker- - BBC News\n\n'Saving Christmas' for lonely cats - BBC News\n\nStraying from the traditional is increasingly common practice and Castle Gardens, for example, has featured Strictly Come Dancing, Great British Bake Off and I'm a Celebrity in its previous displays. \n\nBut retailers are also focusing more on the idea of gifting, says Mr Neilly, promoting the season's\"must-haves\"which can handily be bought in store.\n\nHowever, this backfired in Nottingham when feminists branded a Marks and Spencer display suggesting women need\"fancy little knickers\"as\"vomit-inducing\". \n\nThe shop's apparent display faux pas was not the only one to make headlines. \n\nA pair of stuffed polar bears re-arranged in a compromising position also shocked shoppers on the Isle of Man, giving - as one person quipped 0\"new meaning to riding the Polar Express\".\n\nMeanwhile, on Oxford Street in London, a major retailer scrapped using fake snow after the store ended up resembling a\"foam party\", says Mr Neilly.\n\n\"[It] had to be mopped out by store staff on an hourly basis.\"\n\nThe windows of Christmas past\n\nWith increasing pressure to improve on last year's display - and competition to attract shoppers to the High Street tougher than ever - perhaps it is to be expected that experimentation might occasionally lead to unintended results.\n\nSo how can success be guaranteed?

Rusty steel chimneys lie collapsed across the roadways. \n\nPower plants and dormitory blocks lie half-smashed, their innards spilling out through the walls - cast-iron beds and baths, piping and wiring, cushions and mattresses all now leaking into the freezing air. Some of the huge steel cylinders of the whale oil tanks, 30ft high and 30ft across, have had their sides folded in, as if by a giant hand. But these are just the effects of time and the brutal winds of the Southern Ocean.\n\nIt is not somewhere you would ever like to be alone. The winds that hurl off the mountains of this sub-Antarctic island, 800 miles east of the Falklands, on the same latitude as Cape Horn, make the whole place creak and groan.  Rusted corrugated sheets screech against their fixings, doors slam open and shut, the ventilator cowls on the giant processor plants still turn in the wind as they have done since the place was finally abandoned and left to the elements in 1965.\n\nNo-one is there now because Leith Harbour, like most of the other whaling stations on South Georgia, is strictly off-limits. The collapsing structures are too dangerous and the asbestos in which the whale processing machinery is still wrapped makes the enclosed places too toxic. The South Georgia government - this is one of Britain's few remaining overseas territories - had to give us permission to film in this breathtaking time-capsule of a forgotten way of British life. And we had to be accompanied by Tommy Moore, a Yorkshireman familiar with asbestos safety, and dressed in full protective gear. \n\nPick your way through the buildings now and you find yourself in a forgotten world - mounds of harpoon heads lying rusted together, whale ribs and scapulae everywhere, abandoned tractors and rusted lathes. In the manager's villa, graffiti tells of Argentine joy in 1982 at recovering their own, every word of it covered with the unequivocal responses of the crews of Royal Navy ships who arrived a few weeks later. \n\nSnow clogs the doorways of the cinema where the whalers used to watch over and over again the few films they had, the dust-filled hall still filled with memories of Elizabeth Taylor and Deborah Kerr. The hospital still has unopened bottles of milk of magnesia and tins of Prickly Heat Powder on the shelves of its half-trashed pharmacy. Stinking fur seals lurk in the radio shack and among the overturned benches of the canteen. In the dormitories, the whalers' pin-ups still smile winsomely from the walls. Hidden in attic spaces you can find the bowls, ladles and tins of yeast with which the whalers made the fearsome hooch to console themselves on long winter evenings 8,000 miles from home.\n\nThe whole place is a monument to a huge and massively destructive episode in British history. By the beginning of the 20th Century, whaling had virtually eliminated the stocks of whales in much of the northern hemisphere. Europe had a growing appetite for the oils that whales could provide - most of it for margarine and soap - and the vast stormy waters of the Southern Ocean beckoned, teeming with krill and with the whales that fed on it. \n\nAlmost entirely fuelled by British finance, the whalers came south and embarked on a bonanza that lasted for two-thirds of the century. Individual whalers made the kind of money they could only have dreamed of at home. A young man returning to Shetland or the Hebrides in the 1950s after 18 months\"at the ice\"could buy a house, start a business or commission a fishing boat on his earnings. \n\nChristian Salvesen, the Edinburgh-based whaling company that built Leith Harbour, could hope in some years for 100% dividend on their investment. At the peak of the business in the 1920s, Salvesen's were making the equivalent \u00a3100m a year in profit in today's money.\n\nNone of it was easily earned. The conditions were brutal. Ice often clogged the rigging and individual catching boats were known to founder in the steep seas of the southern ocean. Earnings were dependent on the number of whales caught and the skipper-gunners drove boats and crews relentlessly. \n\nWhen the enormous bodies of the whales were hauled ashore into the huge processing plants, an army of men got to work, working 12-hour shifts, stripping the blubber from the carcasses,\"like peeling a banana\", as the whalers all say, shovelling the meat into the giant cookers, cutting up the bones with enormous steam saws and boiling them up for the oil they contained. \n\nAn entire whale, the size of a railway carriage, could be disposed of in 20 minutes. If newly caught, there were consolations:\"You could warm your hands in the fresh blood,\"Jock Murray, a whaler from the Hebrides remembers.\"If it was a week old, that was something else.\"\n\nIt is difficult to recover the frame of mind in which the destruction of so many of the greatest animals on earth seemed like a good idea. About 1.6 million whales were killed in the Southern Ocean in about six decades. The whalers remain deeply ambivalent about it today. Many say they are proud to have done it but wouldn't do it now. \n\nThere are other ways, largely through plant extracts, of getting equivalents of the oils once taken from the whales. But, as one of the whalers, John Alexander, says:\"We thought we were doing some good for the country.\"They were garnering fats which Britain desperately needed, particularly in the years after World War Two. It was a difficult task, at which they became immensely skilled. And as boys from crofts or fishing families in marginal parts of Scotland, they were providing for themselves in a way little else could have.\n\nEven so, there is some pain in the memory.\"When we killed the sei whales,\"Roddy Morrison, from Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, remembers,\"they used to make a noise, like a crying noise. They seemed so friendly, and they'd come round and they'd make a noise, and when you hit them, they cried really. \n\n\"I didn't think it was really nice to do that. Everybody talked about it at the time I suppose, but it was money. At the end of the day that's what counted at the time. That's what we were there for.\"\n\nBritain's Whale Hunters: The Untold Story, presented by Adam Nicholson, is broadcast on BBC Four on Monday 9 June at 21:00\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: Once British sailors were a big part of the whaling industry in the southern hemisphere.

The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim.\n\nWhat was the timeline of events?\n\nTrump pushes debunked'pig's blood' myth, hours after Barcelona attack\n\nAnalysis: A worrying trend\n\nGordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent\n\nBarcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or\"soft\"target. \n\nIn Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. \n\nIn the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. \n\nThe weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services.\n\nAlthough so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its\"soldiers\"had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter.\n\nEither way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature.\n\nEurope's deadly vehicle attacks\nTL;DR: Spanish police say they have shot dead five suspected terrorists in the town of Cambrils in a second vehicle attack, hours after another in Barcelona killed 13 people and injured dozens.\n\nArticle: Figures released by motoring charity the RAC Foundation show the authority aims to make road repairs within five working days.\n\nCumbria, Flintshire and South Lanarkshire councils try to act\"immediately\"to sort out defects.\n\nCoventry City Council said it had a\"good track record on road repairs\".\n\nInformation on its\"five working day response\"also appears on the council's website - but the authority told the BBC they would visit potholes which pose a\"danger\"within two hours.\n\nThe figures are based on Freedom of Information (FOI) data provided by about 190 of the 207 local highway authorities in Britain.\n\nAccording to the research, Harrow Council has a target repair time of half an hour, while a further 16 councils aim to patch things up within an hour.\n\nThe RAC said response times are influenced by how many miles of road a council has to manage and the size of the council area.\n\nThe most common response time is two hours, with 79 local authorities looking to repair their roads within this period.\n\nRAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said:\"It is understandable that large rural authorities set themselves longer response times, simply as a result of having to travel further to effect repairs, but motorists might still be surprised to see such a wide variation across the country.\n\n\"Those particularly vulnerable to potholes - cyclists and motorcyclists - might ask whether the speed of pothole investigation should be based solely on the risk to users.\"\n\nInformation on Coventry City Council's website refers to repairing potholes more than 40mm deep\"within five working days\".\n\nNeil Cowper, head of highways for Coventry City Council, said\"where a pothole is a danger to pedestrians and other traffic users we act as soon as we can get officers to the site, usually within two hours\".\n\nHe added:\"There have been many cases where, on investigation, a pothole has been coned off immediately and an officer has stayed on site to ensure that the area is made safe.\"\n\nMr Cowper said the council also had\"a team of inspectors who monitor our roads and pavements and they respond quickly to reports of serious defects\".\n\nThe council also questioned the wording of the FOI request and how the RAC compiled their statistics.\n\nThe RAC said they found local highway authorities adopted a\"risk-based approach\"to fixing road defects with the volume of traffic and mix of road users taken into account when deciding how quickly to act.\n\nAlmost all authorities set minimum sizes for potholes before they will take action, which vary from 20 to 30mm deep at 37 councils to at least 50mm at 26 others.\n\nMartin Tett, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said:\"Keeping roads safe for all users is one of the most important jobs councils do and is reflected in the fact that local authorities are fixing a pothole every 21 seconds, with priority given to repairing potholes that pose the greatest risk based on their size and location, as recognised in this report.\"\n\nHe added that councils need\"consistent and fairer government investment in local road maintenance\".\nTL;DR: Coventry City Council has the longest response time in Britain for filling in serious potholes, new research has revealed.\n\nArticle: Uncontrolled dogs, drones and coastal explorers have distressed seals, leading to them needing rescue, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said.\n\nIt has come in a summer that saw many people head to the English seaside when the coronavirus lockdown was eased.\n\nThe charity has asked people to give the animals space.\n\nMCS said it had received a\"concerning\"number of calls relating to wildlife being disturbed on the Yorkshire coast.\n\nIn the past few weeks, seal pups have had to be rescued from Filey and Bridlington after their mothers left them to fend for themselves.\n\nMatt Barnes, a volunteer from MCS, said although seals might look docile, they were wild and strong animals.\n\n\"Seals are very vulnerable to disturbance, which upsets their routine of feeding and digestion, increases their use of energy, raises their stress levels and means they are more likely to injure themselves,\"he said.\n\nMr Barnes said as lockdown was lifted more visitors had headed to the coast, which had upset local seal colonies.\n\n\"This has manifested in people seeking'seal selfies', having uncontrolled dogs off the leads, drones, water craft and coastal explorers disturbing vital haul out sites,\"he said.\n\nSeal pupping season has started, meaning young, weaning pups and their mothers need space.\n\nIf they were disturbed, the pups could be abandoned and left to fend for themselves.\n\nLeaving the animals alone, keeping noise to a minimum and ensuring dogs were on leads were some of the things needed to keep the animals calm, MCS said.\nTL;DR: Visitors to the Yorkshire coast have been upsetting seals by trying to get selfies with the animals, a wildlife charity has warned.\n\nArticle: He made his appeal while celebrating Mass in three native languages after a new Vatican decree approved their use.\n\nThe Pope also used the open-air service in San Cristobal de las Casas to warn about threats to the environment.\n\nThroughout his five-day trip he has condemned the evils of forced emigration and drugs.\n\nHe has urged Mexico's leaders to provide\"true justice\"to suffering citizens. \n\nBut on Monday he drew attention to the suffering of indigenous people in his address in Chiapas state.\n\n\"On many occasions, in a systematic and organised way, your people have been misunderstood and excluded from society,\"the 79-year-old pontiff said after citing Popol Vuh, an ancient Mayan text.\n\n\"Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior.

In hot weather, why not take a cooling dip in the sea, and leave lockdown constraints on the beach with your towel?  But apart from the crowds and infection risk, beware of the political and economic undercurrents.  \n\nBrexit is about to surface once more - a giant creature that's been lurking in the shallows while attention has been turned elsewhere. With each round of inconclusive talks, it is those waters, and specifically the fish and shellfish in them, that become more central to the outcome.\n\nIt features a trial of negotiating strength, guile and apparently quite a lot of self-delusion. A great deal more depends on the outcome than the fishery jobs.\n\nYes, it's four months since the UK left the European Union, and seven months until the transition is scheduled to end. This week is an important one for deciding the terms of the new relationship, and the early signs are that it's going badly.\n\nSo it's time for an update, with a reminder of what was going on last time you paid any attention. \n\nAussie-style\n\nAt the end of January, Boris Johnson was busy booking his place in history, or so he thought.  What he was doing rather less was heeding the warning klaxons about an infection spreading rapidly in China. It's the latter that seems more likely to define his term as prime minister.\n\nHowever, the way things are looking, we could be heading not only for the biggest recession at least since the 1930s, thanks to Covid-19, but also that Brexit cliff-edge we were talking about last year. \n\nThere's no sign of entente breaking out via the Microsoft Teams meetings that have had to become the diplomatic channels for UK and EU negotiating teams.\n\nSupporters of Brexit are determined there will not be a delay on the 31 December end to transition. That remains, firmly, the government's position. \n\nIt can't simply play for time, and kick the can down Theresa May Boulevard, because the transition deal states that any delay has to be for at least two years. To Brexiteer Tory MPs, that's an impossibly high price for accepting an extension.\n\nLater this month, in a summit meeting, the two sides are scheduled to reflect on their negotiations and make a judgement as to whether it is worth continuing the effort to get a deal.\n\nAnd if they conclude there is not, those Brexiteers say: so be it - the UK would be trading with the European Union on what we have learned to call World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. Mr Johnson calls them Australia-style terms. Either way, they are the WTO's least effective arrangements to ease trading.\n\n'Johnny Foreigner'\n\nFor now, there are two broad schools of thinking on this.  One embraces a future where Britain can shed Europe's environmental, social and labour rules, and become more competitive than the European Union. For them, sovereignty is all and compromise is for Johnny Foreigner.\n\nThe other is aghast - looking at the unprecedented calamity that has struck the British, European and global economies due to Covid-19, and wondering how anyone could consider this a good time to take a risk on a full break from Europe's single market and customs union.  \n\nBrexiteer outrider commentators are arguing that the Brexit pain won't feel so bad in the context of suffering something much worse. \n\nBut from the academic network known as UK in a Changing Europe, there's been a reminder that their modelling suggests an economy that will grow 8.1% less in the next 10 years than it might otherwise be expected to do, while UK government modelling suggests a 7.6% shortfall.\n\n(We're very unlikely to be able to measure the true impact of Brexit, because there will be other, very powerful factors at work in trying to repair the economy post-pandemic. The closest we're likely to get is by comparison with similar countries still inside the EU.)\n\n'Dispensable'\n\nIn this crunch week of talks, the negotiating gulf is around promises which the EU members thought they had secured in tying Britain to Europe's\"level playing field\"of common standards on environment, social and labour market standards. \n\nThere is a big gap also on their expectation of how disputes over such standards will be resolved. The EU wants that in its Court of Justice. The UK says\"no way, Jose\".\n\nAnd then there's fish.  How is it that fisheries have become the third track of disagreement and impasse? And why, when one considers the industry is tiny, relative to the British economy (0.1% of economic output) and population, and it's tinier by EU ones?\n\nOne part of the answer is that fishing occupies a totemic and political role more than an economically significant one.  This was the British industry that was hit hardest by entry into the European Common Market. Whitehall in the 1970s saw it as\"dispensable\", or so it was admitted in an internal memo.\n\nEverything since then - including increased efficiency of catch forcing a reduction in the number of boats and men, and the harsh counter-measures to over-fishing - has been implemented through European institutions, so it's been blamed on Brussels. It has come, therefore, to be a special focus for Brexiteers.\n\nWith well over half the tonnage of fish caught in UK waters landed by foreign-registered boats - roughly eight times the amount caught by British boats in EU countries' waters - it has also become commercially important to the fishing fleets of the UK's nearest neighbours.\n\nQuid pro quo\n\nThe EU negotiating mandate wants to retain what it calls\"relative stability\", which is an allocation of quota based on the shares back in the 1970s. If anyone thinks European capitals are ready to go soft on Michel Barnier's mandate, they should be aware that he was told to strengthen the mandate - that is, not to trade away those fishing rights. \n\nLook at it from President Emmanuel Macron's point of view: his re-election efforts will not be helped if there's uproar and port blockades in the politically-significant Pas de Calais region. We recently got a taste of what is a serious risk, with a skirmish between boats fishing around the Channel Islands.\n\nThe British want annual negotiations, based on sustainable quotas. In the jargon, at which fishery management excels, it's called\"zonal attachment\". This assumes that the British government will have control over UK waters, so its fleet will get a much bigger share. \n\nThis is important to the UK negotiating position, which is the other reason fishing is disproportionately important to these talks.  This is one industry on which the UK has leverage. It has a lot to gain from ending CFP quotas, and a lot it could give.\n\nBut it needs to avoid quid pro quo deals in which fish are traded with access to European markets where the UK badly needs concessions from Brussels, such as the finance sector's reach into European markets.\n\nParking the sharing of fish quotas, by saying they'll be decided each year on the evidence available, and that Britain can relate to the CFP in the same way as Norway, would avoid the pressure to give ground on quota specifics as part of an over-arching deal.\n\nThe EU is firmly saying that the whole deal has to be integrated, without such side deals.  It also has some leverage on fisheries, in that Britain sells a lot of fish into the European market, and there are more jobs in processing than in fishing.\n\nNot all fishing businesses or communities are as gung-ho for Brexit as in north-east Scotland or Cornwall. Neither Hebridean creelmen nor Grimsby gutters want the disadvantage of tariffs being levied on those export sales, or of delays at the Channel for delivery of fresh produce.\n\nCapitulation\n\nHow will this work out?  With difficulty. Negotiations often involve bluster, claiming to be digging in to\"red line\"negotiating positions and timetables. The British side has been big on that approach since the 2016 referendum, allied to a consistent misreading of where negotiating power lies. It hasn't worked well so far, instead leading to a series of embarrassing capitulations. But this week, it's still the tactic being used.\n\nThis month, Boris Johnson will have to choose whether he continues the talks or plays to hardliners in his party who prefer\"no deal\"to compromise.\n\nThrough his handling of lockdown and the Cummings affair, the prime minister has weakened his position within Tory ranks. Facing him in the Commons, he now has a Labour opponent, in Sir Keir Starmer, who can hound him over the choice he makes.\n\nThe current impasse may turn out to be bluff. There's no point in hinting at an extension until the point when you have to propose one. Compromises, when they eventually come, tend to be made quickly.\n\nBut surprises aren't always welcome. For both sides, there is the need to get the deal through the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments.  Westminster is one. \n\nAnother parliament, without a veto, is at Holyrood. It will have a say, however, and a noisy one, in the months leading up to the next election. \n\nIn Scotland, Brexit is a faultline that currently looks likely to suit the SNP better than Jackson Carlaw's Tories.\nTL;DR: Time for an update on Brexit, which hasn't gone away, and nor have the UK or EU edged any closer to a deal on their future relationship. Boris Johnson goes into a summit this month, where he decides whether to keep trying for an agreement, or walk away and pay the high economic cost of 'no deal'. Fisheries has become a totemic and a real obstacle to a deal, where compromise looks particularly difficult, and here's why.\n\nArticle: King's College, Cambridge discovered the extensive cemetery, containing more than 60 graves, after demolishing a group of 1930s buildings.\n\nEvidence of Iron Age structures and Roman earthworks was also identified.\n\nDr Sam Lucy, from the University of Cambridge, said the discovery of graves spanning different periods was\"very unusual and really interesting\".\n\nSince the 19th century, archaeologists have believed there was an early Medieval/Anglo-Saxon cemetery in west Cambridge.\n\nThe buildings at Croft Gardens, which had recently housed graduates and staff, were demolished last summer to make way for more modern halls.\n\nBefore construction started, a team from Albion Archaeology were able to fully investigate the site for the first time.\n\nAround 700 items in the graves were uncovered, including bronze brooches, bead necklaces, swords, short blades, pottery and glass flasks.\n\nMost date from the early Medieval period - the 4th to the 7th Centuries AD - when Anglo-Saxons lived in the East of England, but Dr Lucy said there was\"a small cluster that might be late Roman\".\n\nShe said the deeper, stone-lined graves were\"not normally an early medieval practice\".\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon graves there\"tend to be people buried fully dressed, so they've got brooches and beads holding bits of clothing together\", said Dr Lucy.\n\n\"Some of them have got spearheads and the former remains of shields with them.\"\n\nShe said the discovery would\"give huge potential for further research and actually finding out what was going on in the Cambridge area during this particular period\".\n\nTo help investigate the site, King's College is funding a four-year research fellowship into late Medieval and early Roman Britain.\n\nResearchers will look at the skeletons, the textiles and the buried possessions, to learn about out the population's origins, diet, diseases, injuries, health and lifestyle.\n\nThough Cambridge was a Roman town, the people buried at the site would have been a\"rural population, living in villages\", said Dr Lucy.\n\n\"We get a really nice picture of a community and death and we try to use that to tell us a bit about how they were living their lives as well,\"she added.\n\nCroft Gardens will be developed into accommodation for graduate students and is due to be completed in 2022.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Instead, he was worried about an extension to the lockdowns imposed by the government.\n\nHe said the Italian government had taken\"dramatic action\"to contain the spread of the virus and he did not want to find himself\"stuck\"in Venice. \n\nBut that came at a price.\n\nWhile the couple has received a full refund for the hotel, Mr Baker said Ryanair had not refunded the \u00a3180 they spent on flights.

But the association has since clarified that its recommendation to concerned pet-owners is to take the precaution of keeping cats indoors\"only if someone in their own household showed symptoms\".  \n\nEvery pet-owner though should\"practise good hand hygiene,\"she said. \n\n\"An animal's fur could carry the virus for a time if a pet were to have come into contact with someone who was sick.\"\n\nIn a recent paper on the subject, Dr Angel Almendros referred to the case of a 17-year-old pet dog in Hong Kong that tested positive for the Covid-19 virus - apparently infected by its owner. \n\n\"But even where we have these positive results, the animals are not becoming sick,\"he said. \n\n\"As in the previous Sars-Cov outbreak in Hong Kong, in 2003, where a number of pets were infected but never became sick, there is no evidence that dogs or cats could become sick or infect people.\"\n\nHow is the disease transmitted from humans to animals? \n\nIt appears cats may be susceptible to infection from respiratory droplets - virus particles suspended in air that people cough, sneeze or breathe out.  \n\nFollowing a case in Belgium where a cat tested positive about a week after its owner showed symptoms, scientists in China carried out lab tests that provided evidence of infected cats transmitting the virus to other cats.\n\nMore recently, the US Centers for Disease Control confirmed that two pet cats in New York that showed mild respiratory symptoms had tested positive for the disease. \n\n\"It is interesting to note in the experimental evidence that cats can become infected, alongside the apparent infection of a tiger [at Bronx Zoo in New York],\"Prof Bryan Charleston, director of the UK's Pirbright Institute, which specialises in the study of infectious disease, said, adding that the\"evidence on the transmissibility\"from humans to other animals was building.\n\nThere is also evidence humans can transmit respiratory infections to wild great apes, which makes the global spread of Covid-19 a concern for conservationists working to protect critically endangered animals, including gorillas.  \n\nIn all of these cases though, it is infected humans that pose the threat to other species. \n\nDr Almendros told BBC News:\"We know that the virus did make the jump from an animal into humans [at the beginning of this crisis]\". But, he explained, that this appeared to be linked to people eating those animals. \n\nThere is no evidence that domestic animals can pass this disease back to people.\n\n\"Treat pets like other people in your household. So if you're feeling sick, it's better not to interact with them,\"said Dr Almendros.  \n\n\"I hope pet owners can sleep a bit better with the right advice and information,\"he added.\"It isn't easy these days, I know.\"\n\nUpdate 8 April: This story has been updated to reflect that the British Veterinary Association has issued a clarification about their position.\nTL;DR: Veterinary scientists have recommended cat owners keep their pets indoors to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus among animals.\n\nArticle: The family of Leo Latifi said the nine-year-old\"was always looking for his next adventure\".\n\nLeo was at an after-school swimming club at Great Baddow High School in Chelmsford, Essex, when he hit his head on 23 May 2019.\n\nHis family told Chelmsford Coroner's Court their memories of Leo would be\"in our hearts forever\".\n\nThe incident happened while Leo was with a friend as his father watched his brother swim.\n\nAs the locker unit fell, Leo\"tried to put one foot down but he couldn't, then his head hit the bench\", the inquest heard.\n\nHe died in hospital from a severe head injury.\n\nThe school said the lockers had been checked in 2017 and assessed as\"stable, secure and fit for purpose\".\n\nIn a statement, Leo's family said:\"He loved spending time with all his family members and friends.\n\n\"Leo loved the sunshine very much.\n\n\"Whenever the sun was out and it was warm enough he couldn't wait to get over to his great-grandparents' house and would spend hours playing in the pool with his brother.\"\n\nLeo was described as a\"conscientious and well-behaved boy\"who attended Cubs, played several sports and was well thought of by his teachers.\n\nThe inquest continues.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The policy is as it has been, which is to say no to a new runway both now and in the future.'\"\n\n'Limbo'\n\nThe BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Johnson wanted to kill the idea of a third runway for ever and this was a\"marked escalation\"of the dispute within the party.\n\nQuestioned about a possible expansion during a visit to a school in east London, Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said:\"My party's manifesto is against a third runway and the coalition agreement could not have been clearer: we have ruled out giving the go-ahead to a runway during this parliament. It will not happen during this parliament.\"\n\nLabour's 2010 manifesto supported a third runway at Heathrow, but leader Ed Miliband later distanced himself from the policy, saying he had had\"some very heated arguments\"with predecessor Gordon Brown over the decision and had even considered resigning from the government.\n\nFriends of the Earth's head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton said:\"We don't need more airport capacity in the South East and London already serves more of the world's leading business centres than our European competitors.\n\n\"One of the biggest threats to the economy is climate change - airport expansion would undermine action to tackle it.\n\n\"The demands of the aviation industry are insatiable - if it's allowed to get its way, communities and the environment will be forced to pay the price.\"\nTL;DR: The government is to look at ways to expand the UK's airport capacity, amid suggestions the prime minister will perform a U-turn on his pledge not to build a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nArticle: The 19-year-old, from Chelmsford, was being questioned in connection with the death of Lee Evans, 47, who was stabbed in Cromar Way in the city just before 01:00 BST on 22 June.\n\nThe teenager was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.\n\nHe has been released on bail by Essex Police until 26 July.\n\nDetectives have already questioned and released three men and a woman since the killing.\nTL;DR: A teenager, arrested in connection with the murder of man who was stabbed to death, has been released on bail.\n\nArticle: Jessica O'Shea had put the image in her window in Leeds but removed it after being shouted at by a group of adults.\n\nShe detailed what happened on Facebook, prompting dozens of people to print out and display the poster in their homes.\n\nShe said:\"It's wonderful that something so positive has come out of something which was not very nice.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old teacher, who lives in Rodley, had displayed the poster featuring the handprint of her one-year-old daughter Aida to\"show people in the area that this issue is relevant to everyone that lives here\".\n\nBut not long after it was up, a group of people banged on her window, shouting in protest at the sign.\n\nAfter posting about her experience in the Rodley Community Group on Facebook, she was inundated with messages of support.\n\nAdrian Hood replied:\"If you and your little girl can't put it up, I've printed it off and put up in our window, so people will see it.\"\n\nAnother poster Alex Rogerson, who co-owns local restaurant, Grumpy's Bar and Wood Fired Pizza, said he made an easy-print version of the poster and also printed out dozens of copies for people to collect.\n\nMs O'Shea said:\"I made the poster with my daughter because, although she doesn't understand, it's our job as parents to teach our children to be inclusive and to have respect and understanding for others.\n\n\"Then when I put it up and with the initial reaction, I was really disheartened and it made me think that nothing is ever going to change.\n\n\"But then the messages started coming through and I was totally, totally overwhelmed.\"\n\nShe added:\"To everyone that has shown support and solidarity from one single poster- thank you for showing your love and kindness for humanity.\n\n\"Let's continue to educate our children so peace can become normality.\"\n\nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

and a ship wreck can be seen on the sand at low tide. \n\nAdrian Short, who was born and brought up on Gower and has owned the Worm's Head Hotel in Rhossili for over a decade, said the beach was\"dramatic\"and always surprised first-time visitors.\n\nHe said while the Australians can talk of palm trees, and glistening waters, Rhossili also had natural charms as it has been officially recognised as an area of outstanding nature beauty.\n\n\"There is something for everyone,\"he said, adding that it was popular with surfers, walkers and artists due to its\"ever-changing\"light.\n\n\"Rhossili is rigorously protected and a very dramatic scene,\"he said.\"The conditions are great for surfing.\"\n\nThe bay was one of three UK beaches that made the top 10 European list, joining Woolacombe Beach in Devon in fifth, with Porthminster Beach at St Ives in ninth.\nTL;DR: If you want to annoy an Australian, then suggest that their country's beaches might not quite compare with a corner in \"old\" south Wales.\n\nArticle: The project is expected to take about two years and includes the replacement of four of the five current harbour cranes with two new mobile units.\n\nBefore these can be installed, work has to be carried out on the three berths on which they sit.\n\nThe refurbished berths have been estimated to have a working life of at least 50 years and the cranes 25 years.\n\nThe first of the new cranes, which will be able to operate on either diesel or electricity, is due to be delivered and put in place early in 2013.\n\nCurrently, the cranes handle more than 50,000 tonnes of freight annually and are all at least 40 years old, with two of the units dating back to 1965.\nTL;DR: The first stage of a \u00a313.8m project to update freight facilities at Guernsey's St Peter Port Harbour has begun.\n\nArticle: Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter\n\nMinicab drivers and delivery riders face an\"unacceptable burden\"of having to prove they are\"workers\"not self-employed, two Commons committees say.\n\nThey suggest that companies should be fined if they falsely classify workers and deny them benefits.\n\nA spokeswoman said the government recognised the\"labour market is not working for everyone\".\n\nShe said that was why the government had commissioned Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society of the Arts, to review employment practices. \n\nThe Work and Pensions Committee and the Business Select Committee have drawn up a draft bill which would assume\"worker by default\", to make firms pay holiday and sick pay.\n\nFrank Field, the Labour chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said the draft bill would\"end the mass exploitation of ordinary, hard-working people in the gig economy\".\n\n\"It is time to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers, avoid taxes and free ride on our welfare system,\"he said.\n\nThe committees said that fines levied against firms would make sure that\"the risks of being caught outweigh the gains companies stand to make from illegal practices\".\n\nMr Taylor's report, published in July, called for reform of the law so that gig workers are reclassified as dependent contractors who could then maintain flexibility whilst receiving statutory benefits.\n\n\"We are considering his report carefully and will respond in due course,\"a government spokeswoman said.\n\nGig economy businesses like Uber and Deliveroo insist their workers are self-employed, although Uber has lost several legal cases on the issue.\n\n\"Self-employed\"workers who log on to the gig-business technology platform to find work do not automatically receive statutory benefits.\n\nThe firms say gig workers value the flexibility such\"on-demand\"working provides.\n\nWhat is the gig economy?\n\nIn the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the\"gigs\"they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. \n\nIn the UK, it is estimated that one million people are employed in this type of capacity.\n\nJobs include couriers, ride-hailing drivers and video producers.\n\nWorkers in the gig economy are classed as independent contractors.\n\nThat means they have no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holiday or sickness pay.\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour chairwoman of the Business Select Committee, said that workers rights should not be sacrificed for flexibility.\n\n\"Uber, Deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers,\"she said, referring to the fact that gig firms do not have to pay the same rates of tax as businesses which employ staff on full-time or part-time contracts.\n\n\"This must change. We say that companies should pay higher wages when they are asking people to work extra hours or on zero-hours contracts.\n\n\"Recent cases demonstrate a need for greater clarity in the law to protect workers.\"\n\nMs Reeves also said that employment tribunals should consider higher fines for any firm found to have breached the law.\n\nCompanies like Deliveroo, which recently won a case on the self-employed status of its riders before the Central Arbitration Committee, said that the law on self-employment prevented them offering statutory rights.\n\n\"Deliveroo riders are self-employed for one reason only, it allows them to work flexibly, which riders tell us is exactly what they want,\"a spokesman said.\n\n\"Riders make on average \u00a39.50 an hour with Deliveroo, well above the National Living Wage.\n\n\"Alongside this flexibility and good pay, we want to offer riders more security - such as injury pay and sick pay. At the moment the law prevents us from doing so.\n\nMr Taylor has urged the government to act.\n\n\"The government should note that there is now cross party support for legislation in key areas like extra pay for non-guaranteed hours, a day one statement of rights and conditions and making it much easier for all workers to have independent representation,\"he told me.\nTL;DR: Firms in the \"gig economy\" are exploiting loopholes in employment law leaving workers worse off, say MPs.\n\nArticle: Theodore Schurch, who took his Swiss father's nationality, had been given special permission to join the Army. \n\nWhile stationed in North Africa he was captured and later accused of passing information to the enemy. \n\nAs he was executed while still serving in the Army his name has been included on the Brookwood memorial in Surrey.  \n\nTania Szabo, whose mother was murdered at the Ravensbruck concentration camp, told The Times:\"If it is absolutely conclusive that a person betrayed the Allies of their own free will during the Second World War then they should be erased from public monuments.\"\n\nBut how did it end up there in the first place?\n\nWriting in Britain at War, Andy Brockman said Schurch faced nine charges of treachery under Section 40 of the Army Act.\n\n\"He was also charged with desertion contrary to the Army Act.  In other words, Schurch would be tried as a soldier under military law.\"\n\nBuried with Dr Crippin\n\nWhen World War Two broke out, Schurch was already serving in the Middle East and later took part in a campaign in North Africa, during which he was captured in Torbruk in 1942. \n\nNormally the Swiss Red Cross would have been expected to notify the British authorities of his capture and he would have spent the remainder of the conflict in a prisoner of war camp. \n\nInstead, he disappeared. \n\nBritish intelligence services were first told of Schurch's alleged treason in 1943, and his name appeared in a 1944 list of British subjects who were believed to be aiding the enemy. He was arrested the following year. \n\nA court martial hearing convicted Schurch and sentenced him to death by hanging. \n\nHe appealed twice, and petitioned the king for a reprieve, but to no avail. \n\nOn 4 January 1946, 27-year-old Private Theodore Schurch RASC, Service Number T/61711 was taken from his cell in Pentonville Prison and hanged. \n\nHe was buried in an unmarked grave in the cemetery at Pentonville, alongside five executed POWs, six spies, and Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen.  \n\n'Affront to the memory'\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the War Office and the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) agreed those whose graves were unmarked would be commemorated,\"in a manner which has not yet been decided\". \n\nFor the Army that became the memorial at the Brookwood cemetery, which was unveiled by the Queen in 1958. \n\nBecause Schurch had still been a serving officer at the time of his execution and buried in an unknown grave his name was included on the memorial. \n\nMr Brockman said:\"At least eighteen executed murderers are commemorated at Brookwood.  Most were convicted of sex crimes or, in some cases, what were then termed,'crimes of passion' involving wives, or girlfriends.\" \n\nMr Brockman told the BBC:\"The records show that Theodore Schurch was tried, convicted and executed for treachery as a British soldier and nobody, in either the War Office, or the Home Office, seems to have had a problem with that in 1945.  \n\n\"The result was that the then Imperial War Graves Commission had no discretion in commemorating him alongside those who died honourably while in uniform.  \n\n\"However, in 2017 there will be people who will find the presence of Schurch's name on the memorial at Brookwood an affront to the memory of those who served honourably.\"\nTL;DR: In 1946 a soldier became the last person to be executed for treachery in the UK but why does the traitor's name appear on a war memorial?\n\nArticle: Quinn Cooper, 21, died on 5 September after the Ford Fiesta he was driving collided with an HGV in a lay by close to the A1053 roundabout, near Lazenby.\n\nIn a statement his family said:\"Quinn was taken at his happiest\".\n\nThey said he had studied a law degree and was ready to become a teacher.\n\nThe statement read:\"We love you Quinn more than the world.

These powered the final robot's walking motion.\n\nProf Wood, who is also part of Harvard's Wyss Institute for biologically inspired design said there were a huge number of applications for devices that self-fold. \n\n\"Imagine self-deploying structures - maybe shelters or structures for space exploration or for satellites,\"he told BBC News.  \n\n\"Things where the logistics are difficult, like humanitarian aid in war zones.\"\n\nHe said the team also wanted to inspire a\"maker mentality\"and give people more tools to build complex devices. \n\n\"It's a similar theme to 3-D printing,\"he said. \n\n\"We're trying to provide tools for people - whether they're engineers or not - to build complex structures for whatever they want.\"\n\nUK-based aerial robotic expert Dr Mirko Kovac from Imperial College said the work was an excellent example of robotics research that had the potential to improve our lives. \n\n\"The principle of folding self-assembly is a step changing approach to robot design,\"he told BBC News. \n\n\"It allows non-experts to build mobile robots quickly and at very low cost. \n\n\"In future, such robots could even be made of biodegradable materials and be deployed in swarms to monitor and protect vulnerable ecosystems.\"\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nMIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nHome Wyss Institute at Harvard\nTL;DR: Researchers in the US have developed self-folding robots that are able to take shape and crawl without human intervention.\n\nArticle: By Jonty BloomBusiness correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe public spending watchdog said the government was\"very unlikely\"to hit a 2020 target of 3 million new starts. \n\nThe government had some way to go before it showed the scheme was value for money, the NAO added.\n\nThe government said the apprenticeship numbers were now rising year on year. \n\nApprenticeship and Skills Minister Anne Milton said the government  would continue to work with employers to help them develop their apprenticeship programmes. \n\nThe government radically changed the apprenticeship system in 2017, introducing a levy or tax on large employers which they can then claim back to fund training.\n\nSmaller firms have had to pay more towards training and the suppliers of courses changed. \n\nBut rather than boosting the number of apprenticeships, they have fallen by a more than a quarter with many small firms giving up on schemes and larger ones failing to even claim back the money they paid in, leaving \u00a32bn unspent.\n\nMany larger firms regard the apprenticeship levy as little more than an extra tax on their wage bill, while many smaller companies are reluctant to have their apprentices go to college one day a week. \n\nAs a result, just when the government is trying to boost the number of people taking apprenticeships and with many students only too keen to be paid to study, rather than running up student debts at college or university, the number starting apprenticeships has slumped. \n\nJust before the new scheme was introduced there were 509,400 starts a year; last year there were just 375,800, a fall of 26%. \n\nAlso, there has been a decline in the lower-level apprenticeships and a rise in the higher, degree equivalent ones. \n\nThis suggests many companies are abandoning apprenticeships aimed at many school leavers with weaker exam results.   \n\n'Much more to do' \n\nAs a result, the head of the NAO, Amyas Morse, said that the Department for Education (DfE) was very unlikely to achieve its target of creating 3 million new apprentices by 2020. In fact, it would have to double the number starting new apprenticeships to stand any chance of hitting that target. \n\n\"Despite making changes to the apprenticeships programme, the department has not enticed employers to use available funds or encouraged enough potential recruits to start an apprenticeship.\n\n\"It has much more to do to meet its ambitions. If the department is serious about boosting the country's productivity, it needs to set out clearly whether its efforts are on track to meet that aim,\"he added.\n\nThe CBI's chief UK policy director, Matthew Fell, said:\"Today's report confirms what employers already know - that the apprenticeship levy is not yet working as intended and is holding back the government's welcome efforts to modernise the skills system.\n\n\"Companies are committed to apprenticeships, so what's needed now is a second wave of reform.\"\n\nHowever, Ms Milton said:\"The number of people starting training on our new employer-designed standards is rising year-on-year, and we will continue to work with employers to help them develop their apprenticeship programmes.\"\nTL;DR: The number of people starting a training programme has fallen \"substantially\" under the government's new apprenticeship scheme, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).\n\nArticle: Abdulrahman Nassor Juma, who was known to his friends as Mani, was attacked in Crows Road, Barking at about 23:30 BST on 17 May.\n\nPolice and paramedics found the 23-year-old suffering from multiple wounds.

eating too much, drinking too much alcohol and smoking are all putting pressure on health services.\n\nSo living longer does not necessarily mean we are living healthier lives.\n\nQ: Is this the first time these problems have been tackled?\n\nThe Bengoa Report is not the first prescription politicians have sought for the ailments facing Northern Ireland's health care services.\n\nSince the turn of the century, three major reviews have been published and each suggested cutting the number of acute hospitals - those providing A&E services and emergency surgery.\n\nSir Liam's report recommended setting up an international panel of experts to redesign some health and social care facilities.\n\nIn January 2016, Stormont's then health minister Simon Hamilton agreed and appointed a panel of six, chaired by Prof Rafael Bengoa.\n\nQ: Who is Prof Rafael Bengoa?\n\nThe Spaniard is an internationally renowned expert on health reform who has advised the European Union and the Obama administration in the US.\n\nHe worked for the World Health Organisation (WHO) for more than 15 years.\n\nHe is also a former minister of health in the Basque region. \n\nQ: How much strain are waiting lists under?\n\nThis time last year, a senior health expert said heads would roll in England if hospital waiting lists were as long as those in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC in October 2015, Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, described the figures as\"serious\"and called for immediate action.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, there was almost a 50% rise in waiting lists. \n\nThe numbers jumped from 155,558 patients in September 2014 to 230, 625 in September 2015.\n\nAccording to the most recently published data from August 2016, more than 225,000 men and women were on a waiting list to see a health consultant.\n\nMore than 70,000 were waiting for in-patient and day patient appointments.\n\nMore than 95,000 were in a queue for a diagnostic service.\n\nQ: What is the current state of emergency care provision?\n\nNorthern Ireland has nine acute hospitals that are open round the clock. Two others have reduced opening hours for their emergency departments.\n\nQ: What is the future prognosis?\n\nThe challenges posed by an ageing population are likely to be exacerbated in the coming years, unless the problems are addressed.\n\nBy the year 2024, Northern Ireland's 1.8m population is expected to rise by more than 5% to just under 2m.\n\nThe number of people aged over 65 is due to rise by almost 26%, while the working age population is set to rise by just 1%.\n\nThe wide-ranging demands placed on the health service are also increasingly costly and complex.\n\nLast year, more than 6,000 people turned up at emergency departments across Northern Ireland having self-harmed - most were aged between 15 and 24. \n\nOver-indulgence on food is leading to increased levels of diabetes and weight-related disorders, while the abuse of alcohol and drugs are putting a strain on emergency departments.\n\nWhen he published his report into Northern Ireland's health care system last year, England's former chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said acute hospitals were being\"kept in place because of public and political pressure\". \n\nSince then, Stormont ministers have been making noises that suggest they are preparing to take some unpopular decisions. \n\nThis month, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill called the current waiting list figures\"shocking\"and\"unacceptable\". \n\nHer predecessor Simon Hamilton talked about the need for consensus and  taking the\"politics out of healthcare\".\n\nWhether ministers will follow doctors' advice this time remains to be seen.\nTL;DR: A long-awaited report on the future of Northern Ireland's health and social care system has been published.\n\nArticle: By Deborah CohenHealth Check, BBC World Service\n\nIn the 1990s, thousands of babies born with HIV in Zimbabwe died in infancy, as today's cheap life-saving drugs were not available in sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nBut to the great surprise of doctors, there are thousands of teenagers like Tadisa who have lived with HIV for more than a decade. \n\nWhen Dr Rashida Ferrand wanted to research these young survivors, she was told none were still alive. \n\n\"Five years ago people would shake their heads in disbelief and say:'Well, no, nobody survives,'\"said the HIV expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"Survival beyond five years is considered absolutely exceptional.\"\n\nNo-one knows exactly why people like Tadisa survived childhood with untreated HIV.\n\nBut while they have lived longer than expected, their lives have not been straightforward.\n\nMany suffer chronic health complications, including disfigurement, and as a result are socially ostracised.\n\nDr Ferrand now treats these teenagers in Zimbabwe and is a passionate advocate for them.\n\n\"These children are more likely to be poor and to have lost their parents to Aids,\"she said.\"They've been shifted around amongst guardians and missed education, so the odds are stacked against them.\"\n\n'Untreated HIV infection'\n\nSub-Saharan Africa accounts for 69% of the world's HIV cases. Today, nearly one in 20 adults live with the condition.\n\nLife-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been available for free since 2004 in the region and has transformed the outlook of those with the virus.\n\nBut children like Tadisa who survived unexpectedly have often gone untreated, and the complications of untreated HIV - such as damage to the lungs and heart - are debilitating.\n\n\"There's also some brain damage leading to them not being able to perform in school,\"said Dr Ferrand.\"There are some obvious visible signs of longstanding untreated HIV infection, such as stunting and skin disfigurement.\n\nPart of the problem is a lack of awareness: four out of five children with HIV do not know that they have the virus. \n\nTheir medical problems are often put down to normal childhood illnesses and they do not get tested for HIV until they are in their teens.\n\n'Culture of silence'\n\nDr Ferrand described a\"culture of silence\"and said the\"most shocking\"aspect of her research was that nearly all the older children and adolescents who have tested positive could have been diagnosed earlier.\n\nTwo-thirds had been to a primary health care clinic in the previous six months, a quarter had been in hospital at some point in their lives, and more than half had a parent or sibling with HIV.\n\nDespite this, no-one had thought to test them for HIV. \n\nOnce tested, there was no standard way for young people to be told of their status, according to research at Harare's Parirenyatwa Ol Clinic led by Dr Khameer Kidia and including Dr Ferrand.\n\nThey asked 31 patients aged between 16 and 20 how they discovered they were HIV-positive.\n\nAlthough the advice was for their parents or guardians to tell them, the adolescents preferred to hear the news for themselves.\n\n\"I wanted to be told at the clinic just so I know that it's really true, that I've been tested, and it's true\", said one 17 year-old girl.\n\nSome children had guessed, such as one 17-year-old boy who told the researchers:\"My mother was lying to me saying I have a heart problem, I have a hole in my heart. So I decided to say,'Okay.' \n\n\"But I knew. I knew that when I was coming here I was HIV-positive.\"\n\nAnd sometimes the news was given in an abrupt manner. \n\n\"My grandmother told me at home,\"said one 18-year-old boy.\"I was watching TV. My grandmother came up to me and said:'Hey, A, do you know that you're HIV-positive?' I said,'Okay.' She said it twice:'You're HIV-positive.' I just said,'Okay.'\"\n\nStigma\n\nThe adolescents learn most about their condition from each other rather than their parents and guardians, the researchers found.\n\nOnce diagnosed, they can keep the virus at bay with the free ARTs. \n\nBut one reason their guardians did not bring them for diagnosis and treatment was to protect them and their families.\n\n\"They fear that if the child is disclosed to, he will go about in the streets or at school telling others and other relatives that don't know that the parents are positive,\"said a counsellor at Parirenyatwa Ol Clinic.\"So they will be stigmatized or discriminated against as a family.\"\n\nIn 2013 a UNICEF report stated that only about a third of children with HIV were receiving ARTs, compared with around two-thirds of adults. \n\nNew WHO guidelines say testing should be offered to all adolescents living in areas of the world where HIV is common, particularly sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nDr Ferrand believes it is an issue of child rights that the young people learn about their HIV status and receive treatment.\n\nHear Dr Ferrand speaking to Health Check on the BBC World Service.\nTL;DR: Fifteen-year-old Tadisa was never expected to live. Her mother Grace was HIV-positive and passed the virus on to Tadisa at birth.\n\nArticle: A relative latecomer to filmmaking, he became famous for his fast-paced blockbusters and distinctive style of editing and digital effects, calling directing\"the best job in the world\".\n\nHe was the younger brother of Gladiator and Blade Runner director Ridley Scott, whose debut - a short film called Boy and Bicycle - he starred in at the age of 16. \n\nTony Scott originally intended to become a painter, after studying at West Hartlepool College of Art, completing a fine arts degree at Sunderland Art School and graduating from the Royal College of Art. \n\nHowever the success of his older brother's television commercial production company, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), changed his mind - especially when Ridley promised him he would earn enough to buy a Ferrari within a year. \n\nThe first feature film he directed was vampire romance The Hunger in 1983. \n\nStarring David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve it was not a hit with critics, but did later go on to become a cult movie.\n\nHowever it did catch the attention of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson who signed him up to direct Top Gun, after also seeing a commercial Scott made for Swedish car company Saab. \n\nIt showed one their cars racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. \n\nTony bounced back with Top Gun, becoming the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success. The film made a star of Tom Cruise and became the highest-grossing film of 1986, taking $176m (\u00a3112m) at the box office. \n\nIts success propelled Scott onto Hollywood's A-list of action directors and he worked again with producers Simpson and Bruckheimer on 1987 Eddie Murphy sequel Beverly Hills Cop II, before directing Cruise for a second time on their big budget racing drama Days of Thunder in 1990.\n\nScott was an avid rock climber and liked driving fast cars and motorcycles, but he called filmmaking his real thrill.\n\n\"The biggest edge I live on is directing. That's the most scary, dangerous thing you can do in your life,\"Scott said in an interview for his 1995 submarine thriller Crimson Tide. \n\n\"The scariest thing in my life is the first morning of production on all my movies. It's the fear of failing, the loss of face and a sense of guilt that everybody puts their faith in you and not coming through.\"\n\nOften behind the camera in his signature faded red baseball cap, the early 1990s also saw him direct action thriller The Last Boy Scout and True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nScott regularly collaborated with Oscar-winner Denzel Washington, directing the actor in Crimson Tide, Man on Fire, Deja Vu, The Taking of Pelham 123 and his most recent film Unstoppable. \n\nThe runaway train thriller featured the trademark hyper-kinetic action and editing that he had become known for. \n\nHe also directed Robert De Niro in The Fan, Will Smith conspiracy drama Enemy of the State, Spy Game and in 2005 oversaw Keira Knightley's action debut in Domino.\n\nBrother Ridley Scott eventually went on to make bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect that resulted in three best-director Oscar nominations and a best-picture Oscar in 2000 for Gladiator.\n\nCritics were harsher on Tony's films, accusing him of emphasising style over substance and he was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nHe told the BBC in 2005:\"I stopped looking at reviews after my first movie The Hunger, because I got slagged off so badly.

It's a measure of how many extra people each coronavirus case is infecting, \n\nIn March, before any control measures were put in place, R was thought to be just under three. \n\nThe ONS's estimates of how much of the population is currently infected are based on testing a representative sample of people with or without symptoms. \n\nIt is different to the number published daily by the Department of Health and Social Care. That records positive cases in people with potential Covid symptoms who request tests. \n\nAnd in the week up to 19 September, the DHSC data showed roughly 3,000 positive tests a day in England - a total of 23,378.\n\nIn contrast, the ONS survey suggest there were actually 103,600  people in England with the virus, equating to an estimated one in 500 people in private homes.\n\nThe number does not include cases in hospitals and care homes.\n\n'Clear evidence' of increase\n\nThe ONS said there was\"clear evidence\"of an increase in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in all age groups, but rates are currently highest in those aged 17-24.\n\nInfection rates are highest across the north of England and in London, with smaller increases seen in the Midlands. \n\nIn Wales, cases appear to have risen dramatically but because there are fewer people in the sample, there is a lot of uncertainty around the precise figure.\n\nBut central estimates suggest they could have risen almost seven-fold, from 1,500 people in total having Covid the previous week to more than 10,000.\n\nThe ONS has also begun surveying people in Northern Ireland, where early figures suggest one in 300 people had the virus in the period 6-19 September.\n\nThese figures only take us up to the end of last week, and as such may be an underestimate of the current situation.\n\nCases have been rising over the past few weeks, and have begun to translate to a rise in hospital admissions. \n\nData from the Covid Symptom Study app, run by King's College London and tech company ZOE, put the daily figure for England at 12,883 - higher than the ONS.\n\nIts figures are based on people who download and use the app, so it is not a random sample - but does include a larger number of positive tests.\n\nThe ZOE figures are also more up to date than the ONS's and so may be capturing more recent rises.\nTL;DR: The rate at which the Covid-19 virus is spreading appears to be speeding up.\n\nArticle: A mother and her two daughters -

She was 14 and was on her way to a lake not far from her home. \n\nIt was to be a special occasion. She had been asked to help teach a group of younger children how to sail. \n\nIn fact, for Elsie Frost, everything must have seemed rather special at that time.  She had some good friends, had just become a member of the local youth club and had been chosen to be the next head girl at her school. Life was getting really good.\n\nElsie was wearing a yellow woollen sweater, a white blouse and printed cotton skirt. \n\nBefore leaving her family's semi-detatched home in Wakefield, she sat down to put on her brand new pair of shoes. \n\nMaybe she checked outside to see if it was cold because she also wrapped herself up in her favourite red, quilted anorak, which had been bought for her by an aunt. Her sailing clothes were in a duffle bag, which she carried over her shoulder.   \n\nPeople who knew her were later to say that she had seemed very happy.\n\nSeven hours later, Elsie Frost's body was lying in Wakefield Public Mortuary being examined by a pathologist. Her white blouse, yellow sweater and favourite red coat were soaked in blood. She had been stabbed several times. \n\nHer father had to identify her body. It was Saturday 9 October 1965.\n\nElsie's murder dominated the headlines. By the following morning, newspaper journalists had managed to track down her elder sister Anne. She was 18 and was living a few miles away with her husband and son. \n\nBy then, Anne's parents were in her house. They had been sedated and were lying down in her bedroom. Some of the reporters were on the\"verge of aggressiveness\", Anne recalls. Had a policewoman not been with her, she adds, she would not have been able to cope. \n\nElsie's younger brother, Colin, had first been taken to stay with some neighbours and then to an uncle's house. He was six years old. He remembers still being up on the Monday night when ITN News came on. The first image he saw was Elsie's face. His uncle leapt out of his chair, scooped him up and\"zoomed\"him up the stairs. Colin has no memory of the time after that point. \n\nThe police investigation was huge. Scotland Yard detectives were drafted in to help the local forces in Yorkshire. According to a senior police officer at the time, thousands of people were interviewed and more than 1,200 written statements were taken. \n\nFour hundred people, who lived within a quarter of a mile of the murder, were traced and their movements checked. A large number of knives were taken and examined but it was not thought that the murder weapon was among them.  \n\nThe police were unable to establish any\"apparent reason or motive for the attack\"and did not know whether\"she was the intended victim or merely passing at the time\".  No one was traced\"with the slightest animosity against the girl\". There was no evidence of a sexual assault and no sign of her having been robbed. \n\nNo-one was ever convicted of her murder.\n\nPrecisely 49 years and 14 days later, Elsie's sister Anne sat down at her computer and typed an email to the BBC. She wrote:\"Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the murder of my 14-year-old sister. The perpetrator has never been brought to justice and I feel sad about that.\" \n\nAnne's sadness had not lessened as the years passed. To some extent, she had to keep her thoughts bottled up because she could not discuss the murder in front of her father. Arthur found it too upsetting.\"He even found it difficult to talk about her and in fact we never did,\"Anne remembers. \n\nArthur could not even bring himself to look at photographs of Elsie. When Anne's parents died - Edith in 1988 and Arthur in 2003 - they both\"went to their graves\u2026 feeling hugely guilty\"because\"they didn't know what had happened to their daughter\", Anne says.  \n\nAnne is determined that she and her brother Colin will not have\"that same kind of guilt that mum and dad had\".\n\nAs a result of the email, Anne and Colin were interviewed on BBC Radio 4's iPM programme. They told their story and that of their murdered sister. The interview lasted around 19 minutes but can be summed up by 13 words spoken by Anne:\n\n\"Why? Why did it happen? On a Saturday afternoon at half past four?\"\n\nOn 11 January 1966, around three months after the murder, an inquest jury thought it knew who had killed Elsie. These days an inquest's role is only to establish certain facts and the cause of a death. In 1966, an inquest could actually accuse a man of murder. And that is what happened at the inquest into the death of Elsie.\n\nOn the morning of 12 January, the Guardian's headline was:\"Coroner sends man for trial on murder charge.\"The Mirror summed it up with the words:\"Elsie: Man accused of murder.\"\n\nThe man was Ian Spencer, who had appeared at the inquest as a witness. The unanimous verdict of the jury was that Elsie Frost had been murdered and\"that there is a prima facie case against Ian Bernard Spencer\"- effectively accusing him of the crime.\n\nDescribed in different reports as a former railway fireman and as a labourer, he was 33 and married with a son. \n\nHe had appeared as a witness at the inquest because he had been in the area of the murder on the same afternoon but he was insistent that he was at home quite some time before Elsie was killed. His wife, mother-in-law and a family friend said they were able to confirm that but they were not called by the coroner to speak at the inquest. \n\nSome of the witnesses who were called contradicted that story and claimed they thought they saw him close to the area where Elsie's body was found.\n\nIan Spencer was committed to face trial. He spent eight weeks and two days in prison. \n\nIn March 1966 he was cleared. A magistrates' court had already concluded there was no case to answer and a judge at the equivalent of the modern crown court instructed the jury to find him\"not guilty\".\n\nElsie's mother Edith told newspapers:\"I know what Mr Spencer and his wife must have suffered, I am glad for their sakes it is over. I am sure they will be as anxious as I am to have the killer found.\" \n\nOne of the people I spoke to over the past few months was Ian Spencer's son, Lee. His father is now in a care home and unable to communicate, after suffering a severe stroke, but Lee was keen to speak on his father's behalf. Lee has a series of his father's notebooks. Opening one at random, it listed places he had been, times and his mileage.\n\nEvery day, every week, every month, year after year, he wrote down everything - the moment he left, the moment he arrived and the moment he returned, wherever he went. \n\nHe did this throughout his working life and continued when he retired.\n\nFinding the log books in his father's house was tough for Lee.\"It's difficult to think that you've got to write this down, day after day,\"he says. \n\n\"He started logging things because of what people had said,\"says Ian Spencer's cousin, Brian Orange.\n\nAt various times during the following years, when there were other murders, the police would arrive at the family home to ask where Lee's father had been when those crimes had been committed. That still angers the family. They believe it was deeply unfair because he had been cleared by two courts. \n\nBrian thinks it is likely that the police visits were one of the reasons his cousin started logging his life.  \n\n\"With the police keeping coming back, he had it in his mind that he would need to be able to say, well, I left home, I went to work. He wanted a safeguard for himself.\"\n\nDespite his acquittal, what happened\"never left him over the last 50 years\", as Lee puts it. \n\nAt every turn in reporting this story, I have found people whose lives have been permanently affected by what happened.\n\nLet us return to Anne's questions. We were left with the knowledge that a teenager had been murdered and a man accused and acquitted of her killing. What though could we find out about the circumstances of Elsie's murder?\n\nI discovered all those details about what Elsie was wearing that day - the red coat, yellow jumper and brand new shoes - in the file from the inquest.\n\nOne of the most difficult days emotionally was when I took Colin to the coroner's office in Wakefield. Staff had kindly retrieved the relevant documents from the archives.  \n\nBefore getting there, Colin told me he would definitely like to know when his sister was killed. The family had thought she died at about 16:30. The file suggests it was earlier than that. \n\nThere is a letter on the coroner's headed paper, which seems to have been typed by or on behalf of the Coroner's Officer, Gerard Browne, at 13:00 on Sunday 10 October 1965. It confirms Elsie's name, address and age and where she was found. \n\nAt the bottom of the page, there are some\"special remarks\". They begin:\"Sir, the deceased girl was found [at] about 4.15pm, Saturday 9 October 1965.\"\n\nFor Colin, knowing this was important. And there was more in the file which was to be new to him. \n\nThe lake - or lagoon - where Elsie was sailing on the afternoon she died was known as the Horbury Sand Quarry. It is close to the River Calder, a canal and some railway lines. \n\nTo return home after sailing, Elsie would most likely have walked on a path which is not there anymore, fairly close to the railway. That area is now totally overgrown. There is another path, which is used now, closer to the canal. \n\nTo reach the other side of the railway, it is believed she headed for what is locally called the\"ABC tunnel\". There are then steps up a steep embankment. There are 26 of them, hence the\"ABC\". \n\nElsie's body was found by a man, Thomas Brown, who had been walking with his young children and their dog. \n\nHe told the inquest:\"When we got to within five or 10 yards of the bottom of the steps, I saw a girl lain there, whom I now know to be Elsie Frost. She was lying with her left arm on the second step and her head was lying on her left arm and her right arm was above her head on the next step. \n\n\"She was crouched up in an awkward position with her legs underneath her body in a kneeling type of position but more on her left hand side. I went up to her and asked her what was wrong and got my hands under her armpits and picked her up. \n\n\"When I spoke to her I did not get any reply. I did not realise she was as badly injured as she was. At this time, my son was at the top of the banking. I tried to persuade the children to go home but they wouldn't.\"\n\nThere are also details in the file about what Elsie was doing within the hour leading up to her death. The event that afternoon at the lagoon was organised by her school's sailing club. The teacher in charge, John Blackburn, told the inquest:\"I beckoned to Elsie and took her out in a boat to give her some instruction, as she had previously got into difficulties when navigating one of the boats. \n\n\"I was out with Elsie Frost in the boat until about five minutes to four.\"\n\nHe explained that Elsie had then helped him to pack the boats away before she left. Other children and another teacher then departed before Blackburn then left at about 16:20. If all the times in the inquest file are accurate, Elsie was killed between about 16:00 and 16:15. \n\nWhile the police never found out what happened during that time, there is a woman who thinks she knows. Her name is Janis Hirst. Back then, her surname was Dixon and she was a friend of Elsie's. \n\n\"When doing my nurse training, I was working at a hospital and got talking about Elsie on a shift we were on. And this nurse had said that she had worked in a hospital where a man had been brought in and he had confessed under drugs to being present at the murder of Elsie. \n\n\"He said that he was in the long grass with another man committing a homosexual act when Elsie had stumbled over them\u2026 and the other man had run off after Elsie and stabbed her. Elsie had caught them in the act and had run off screaming and he jumped Elsie and stabbed her.\"\n\nAccording to Janis, the other nurse said a doctor was also in the room to hear this\"confession\". They did not tell the police because\"whatever a patient tells you is strictly confidential and they couldn't break that confidentiality\"and also because the man was on medication at the time.\n\nThe nurse who Janis said told her all of this died some years ago. Janis says she was given names for the two men but we are not publishing those for obvious legal reasons. She says she is willing to speak to the police.\n\nJanis is confident that what she was told is true but, crucially, she was not there when the supposed confession happened. It is a third-hand story, so one which understandably does have to be treated with a high degree of caution. In legal terms, it would be considered as\"double hearsay\".\n\nI have heard another story along the same lines. According to the former MP for the area, David Hinchliffe, there was a rumour at the time that Elsie had been killed because she had stumbled upon what people described as\"homosexual activity\". It's worth bearing in mind that homosexual acts between men were illegal until 1967.\n\nOf course, when there is any unsolved murder, there will probably always be different stories going around about who might have been responsible. And most will probably not be true.\n\nOne of Anne's fears is that whoever was responsible might have gone on to attack others. A woman called Julie - she only wants us to use her first name - claims something happened to her in the same area nine years later. She was the same age as Elsie had been - 14. \n\n\"We'd bunked off school - me and my brother and his friend and had gone down the quarry,\"she says.\"We'd gone swimming. I was over at the jetty and I got jumped on by a man. He got me in the grass, got on top of me, his hand over my mouth, he slashed my shorts with his knife, he put the knife to my throat. My brother came along and his friend and chased him away.\"\n\nJulie says she did not go to the police\"because I should have been at school. I didn't even tell my mum\". Julie's brother says he remembers there being some kind of incident but does not remember the knife and is short on detail.\n\nIt will be the task of a new police investigation to assess the stories of people like Janis and Julie. It is happening as a result of what we have been doing and it is the first investigation into the murder since the 1960s.\n\n\"The reason why I've taken on this investigation is that I want justice for Elsie,\"says West Yorkshire Police's DCI Elizabeth Belton.\n\nShe is to launch an appeal for information and has not ruled out the possibility that the person responsible might actually come forward to\"clear their conscience and tell me that they've committed the murder and, more importantly, a reason why\".\n\nUnfortunately, DCI Belton will not be able re-examine all the evidence from the time. \n\nWe probably all have an image in our heads, fuelled by all those television dramas we have watched, of vast police storerooms, containing plastic bags full of potentially vital pieces of evidence going back decades. \n\nBut unsurprisingly the police officers in Wakefield in the mid-1960s did not anticipate the amazing scientific advances in DNA testing seen over the subsequent decades. In April 1966, just six months after the murder, some of Elsie's clothing was returned to her father and the rest was destroyed. None of it remains. There are no plastic bags of evidence awaiting the DNA expert. \n\nColin thinks of his sister every time he ties up his shoelaces. It was Elsie who taught him how to do it when he was a little boy. Fifty years after she was killed, she remains on people's minds and not only those of members of her family.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I met Elsie's friend, Janis Hirst, she showed me an old black and white school photograph. Janis is standing in the third row. Elsie is a few places along to her left. Both are grinning. \n\nLike Elsie, Janis was a member of their school's sailing club. In fact, she was meant to have been going sailing with her on the afternoon she died. They had arranged to meet at about 14:00 in order to walk to the lagoon together. But that did not happen. \n\nJanis did not turn up. Her mother was ill and she was sent to the shops instead. Her family did not have a telephone so she was unable to let Elsie know. If they had met up, they would almost certainly have left together too. That has haunted Janis ever since.\n\n\"I remember saying to two detectives who came to our house that if I'd had gone, it might not have happened because there'd have been two of us. And I remember them saying to me:'It could've been that we would have been investigating two deaths. It could've happened to both of you so don't ever think that it was because you weren't there that it happened.'\"\n\nBut that is exactly what has troubled Janis all of these years. As a result, she has written twice to Elsie\"to apologise for not being there that day to walk home with her\". She wrote the first letter when she was 16, the second when she was 40.\n\n\"I think it will always be that doubt in my mind,\"she says.\"There's always that little girl inside of me who thinks I should have been there and it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nFor Anne and Colin, the last few months have, at times, been very difficult. Anne says there were moments when she\"wanted it all to stop\". She had sleepless nights, and sometimes felt she\"might be sinking underneath it\"but says she needed to do something and that it had been worthwhile. After all, she says,\"this has been on my mind for 50 years\".\n\nAnne's main question remains unanswered. Why did it happen? \n\nThe family does now have the new police investigation to give them the hope that the answers will eventually come but Anne admits there is a big risk that she might be left feeling disappointed.\n\nWhen Colin went with me to the coroner's office in Wakefield, he came away with some of the details he wanted to know and with an image in his head. He says that helped. \n\n\"I feel inside actually closer to Elsie than I was. I can see Elsie's body, how it was dressed, the anorak, the shoes, the skirt, what she was carrying.

A BBC investigation has now led to the police resuming their hunt for her killer.\n\nArticle: By Justin RowlattChief Environment correspondent\n\nThe campaign group has produced a detailed\"manifesto\"with measures to boost clean transport and smart power.\n\nThe document follows a comparable call from some of Britain's most powerful business leaders earlier this week. \n\nLast week, the prime minister also expressed a similar ambition.\n\nBoris Johnson said he wanted to see a\"fairer, greener and more resilient global economy\"after Covid-19 and that\"we owe it to future generations to build back better\". \n\nThe manifesto also contains measures to support the protection of nature, green buildings and the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused.\n\nGreenpeace says the crisis has given Britain a\"once in a lifetime\"opportunity to transform life, travel and work.\n\nIt added that the plan would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs.\n\nGreen business\n\nOn Monday, more than 200 chief executives of some of the UK's top firms - including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport - signed a letter to the prime minister asking him to use the Covid-19 lockdown as a springboard to\"deliver a clean, just recovery\".\n\nMany people may be surprised how similar the recommendations of these two very different interest groups are. \n\nGreenpeace's manifesto is, however, considerably more detailed.\n\nIt is a 62-page document with specific policy, spending and tax measures covering most of the British economy.\n\nIt calls on the government to deliver its 2050 net zero emissions goal before 2045.\n\nControversial policies\n\nMany voters say they support tackling climate change when polled.\n\nHowever, lots of the policies Greenpeace proposes would prove very controversial. \n\nFor example, motorists say they are ready to change their behaviour to improve air quality, according to a recent AA survey.  \n\nBut many drivers may balk at Greenpeace's proposals to radically redesign the road network to favour walking and cycling, at the suggestion that petrol and diesel cars are banned by 2030 or that fuel duty is steadily increased.\n\nMany homeowners might be reluctant to spend money to upgrade their properties to meet tough energy efficiency standards.\n\nAt the same time, many local communities are likely to resist the plan for a big increase in onshore wind and solar power to complement a proposed massive expansion of offshore wind farms - few things unite local communities like a proposal to put in an array of wind turbines.\n\nBut, says Greenpeace, tough policies like these are essential if the government is going to take meaningful action to tackle climate change.\n\n\"The choices our government makes now will define\u2026 whether or not we succeed in the fight against the climate emergency\", says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace.\n\n\"If we fail to get this right, we may never get another chance. Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words.\"\n\nIt says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted.\n\nGreenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK.\n\nUnique opportunity\n\nThe UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package.\n\nBack in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to\"turn the tide on climate change\".\n\nMeanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it called the biggest\"green\"stimulus in history.\n\nLast week, it said it planned to commit a whopping \u20ac750bn (\u00a3667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package.\n\nAdd in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.8tn; $2.2tn).\n\nFighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. \n\nThere will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.\n\nThe idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\n\"If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,\"Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC.\n\n\"The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.\"\n\nFollow Justin on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package.\n\nArticle: About 100 vehicles have driven through the barrier at Seaton Valley Countryside Park, just a few hundred metres from Seaton Beach.\n\nResidents said some drivers had also been verbally abusive to those who have confronted them.\n\nIt comes as a nearby caf\u00e9 started charging for their car park because people were\"abusing the privilege\". \n\nA resident told the BBC that vehicles had broken on to the land, blocked emergency access for local properties and were getting stuck in the grass.\n\nThey said they had contacted Cornwall Council but were told no-one was available to help.\n\nStarting on Sunday, Seaton Beach Cafe started charging \u00a310 for cars to park on their land, which is refunded if you spend the same amount at the cafe.\n\n\"It's a decision we haven't taken lightly but this is due to people continually abusing the privilege, leaving legitimate customers driving away unable to park,\"it said in a post on Facebook.\n\n\"We are only sorry we have to take such drastic measures,\"it added.\n\nCornwall Council said its\"parking enforcement team is aware of the issues, and is providing extra patrols who will issue fixed penalties for any unlawful parking\".\n\n\"Planned fencing works were delayed by Covid 19, but will now be carried out after the summer peak.\n\n\"In the meantime temporary fencing may be used to prevent access to the park by vehicles.\"\nTL;DR: Beachgoers have broken on to council land to find parking at a popular Cornish coastal spot, residents claim.\n\nArticle: Trains between Portsmouth and Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour were also suspended.\n\nThe bomb, found by a dredger in the harbour at about 05:00 GMT, was towed out to sea and blown up at 16:00.\n\nCross-channel ferries to and from Portsmouth were suspended when a 500m exclusion zone was set up.\n\nThe cordon was lifted by 14:30, but ferry services were disrupted into the evening.\n\nThe harbour was shut to ferry traffic at 14:00 as the 500lb (227kg) German bomb was towed past the harbour entrance.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it carried out a controlled explosion one-and-a-half miles east of the Isle of Wight.\n\nCdr Del McKnight, who led the bomb disposal team, said:\"Everything went smoothly and we were pleased to be able to get the operation completed in daylight.\n\n\"Despite being old, these devices still pose a very serious threat when they are moved.\"\n\nAhead of the operation, police evacuated the shopping and residential areas of Gunwharf Quays.

for me where you can save one life then it's worth doing.\n\n\"This can't be optional, it can't be a nice to have, this is something that must happen.\n\n\"If that isn't one of the recommendations (of the Grenfell Tower inquiry) then I will be so very disappointed.\"\n\nIn 2007, sprinklers were made compulsory in new-build high rises over 98 feet (30m) tall in England.\n\nThis requirement was not applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.\n\nCroydon Council, in south London, has taken the decision to retrofit sprinklers in its 25 high-rise blocks at a cost of \u00a310m. \n\nCouncillor Alison Butler, Croydon's deputy leader and cabinet member for homes, regeneration and planning, said:\"Grenfell changed everything. It was horrifying. \n\n\"It brings home to you as a council that there are a lot of things you do, but this one is about saving lives.\"\n\nThe council says the Department of Communities and Local Government failed to offer any financial support to install sprinklers when the council requested it earlier this year.\n\nIn a letter to the council, Housing Minister Alok Sharma said\"It is the landlord's responsibility to ensure people are safe, and cost considerations should not get in the way of this.\"\n\nHe did say support would be provided to prevent crucial safety work from falling through on cost grounds.\n\nAfter the inquest into tower block fire in 2009, coroner Frances Kirkham recommended the government\"encourage\"housing providers to retrofit sprinkler systems in high rise flats.\n\nSix people were killed in the fire in Lakanal House, in Southwark, London, in July 2009.\n\nAlan Brinson, executive director of campaign group the European Fire Sprinkler Network, said that sprinklers could significantly reduce fire deaths. \n\n\"Nothing compares to them in saving lives,\"he said.\n\nEvidence from the US shows that deaths per thousand reported fires were 87% lower where sprinklers were fitted. \n\nMajor fires in high rises with sprinklers in which nobody died\n\nIn Wales, all new homes built from 2016 now have to be fitted with sprinkler systems.\n\nAnn Jones, Labour AM for the Vale of Clywd, pushed reforms through the Welsh Assembly.\n\n\"After 30 years in the fire service, I saw many firefighters coming back from incidents of fires where they had lost people, and the devastation that that causes,\"she said.\n\n\"I decided I was going to try to put in a system that would help fire safety, and for me, sprinklers in all new build homes was that opportunity.\"\n\nScotland also has stronger regulation than England, with new residential buildings taller than 18m requiring sprinklers.\n\nBBC research found 30% of the blocks investigated had some kind of cladding, though not the same ACM cladding that played a role at Grenfell.\n\nSome of this cladding will have passed safety tests, and some will still be undergoing checks.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said:\"The results from the BBC investigation should be a source of concern to us all.\n\n\"The Grenfell public inquiry must report as soon as possible so that action can be taken.\"\n\nA Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said:\"Public safety is paramount. \n\n\"Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the government established a comprehensive building safety programme to ensure a fire like this can never happen again.\n\n\"This included commissioning an independent review of building regulations and fire safety.

For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.\n\nHad the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.\n\nAnd it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate\"a remarkable British scientific achievement\", adding:\"We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.\"\n\nChief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.\n\nAbout 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. \n\nOf those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. \n\nAnd these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. \n\nThe drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.\n\nAnd it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. \n\nThis over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. \n\nIn the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. \n\nFor patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. \n\nFor patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.\n\nChief investigator Prof Peter Horby said:\"This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.\"\n\nLead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:\n\n\"There is a clear, clear benefit,\"he said.\n\n\"The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about \u00a35 per patient. \n\n\"So essentially it costs \u00a335 to save a life. \n\n\"This is a drug that is globally available.\"\n\nWhen appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.\n\nBut people should not go out and buy it to take at home. \n\nDexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. \n\nThe Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. \n\nThe antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. \n\nThe first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  \n\nThat is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. \n\nAnd that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. \n\nDexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.\n\nHalf of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  \n\nThe drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. \n\nSo far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  \n\nThat has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.\n\nBut the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. \n\nUnlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.\nTL;DR: A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.\n\nArticle: By Martin CassidyBBC NI consumer affairs correspondent\n\nDown to just six pairs, a grouse regeneration project at the Department of Agriculture's Glenwherry farm has involved culling hundreds of foxes and crows, as well as regenerating the heather grazing. \n\nGrouse shooting is a lucrative business in Scotland where a single day on the moor can cost hundreds of pounds, but while the Scottish economy is raking in millions, in Northern Ireland grouse numbers have been in decline.\n\nThe moor at Glenwherry in the hills above Ballyclare was once well stocked with grouse.\n\nBut habitat decline and predation by foxes and crows meant that young grouse had little chance of surviving.\n\nBy the time a grouse regeneration plan was launched three years ago, the population was down to just half a dozen pairs.\n\nThe first thing that had to be done was to reduce the number of enemies the grouse had to contend with.\n\nThat turned out to a bigger job than anyone had thought.\n\nThe upland farm is bounded by a number of conifer plantations and it was from here that the foxes were launching their attacks.\n\nIn a little over three years the head game-keeper shot 300 foxes.\n\nCrows and magpies, too, pose a threat to grouse nests and so hundreds of these predators have also been killed.\n\nThe next stage of the regeneration project involved improving the food supply for the young grouse.\n\nThat has been done by managing the heather habitat.\n\nRight from the start, young grouse rely on fresh green sprigs of heather.\n\nBut old heather which is overgrown is no use as the young birds simply can't reach up to the juicy part of the plant.\n\nHeather burning is the answer. But it's not simply a case of setting the moor alight.\n\nThe young birds still need older heather bushes to nest and hide in.\n\nAnd as the cover must not be too far away from from where the birds graze, the burning programme needs to be carefully planned.\n\nThe idea is to produce a mosaic of heather plants at different stages of regeneration.\n\nGive grouse the right habitat and numbers can recover quite quickly - a typical clutch of eggs can range from three right up to 15.\n\nProviding the weather in early summer isn't too wet, the young grouse only have to contend with predators and intestinal worms.\n\nMedicated grit is left out for the birds to peck.\n\nThe grit helps the grouse grind up the heather shoots in their gizzards while the medication helps them deal with the worms\n\nGrazing with livestock is also important to keep the moorland habitat from becoming overgrown with grass.\n\nIt is still too early to say if the moor will ultimately sustain a commercial shoot, but the early signs are encouraging for the grouse population.\nTL;DR: The red grouse, one of Northern Ireland's rarest game birds, has been saved from dying out in a remote upland area of County Antrim.\n\nArticle: The Nazca lines, a Unesco World Heritage site, is home to designs on the ground - known as geoglyphs - created some 2,000 years ago.\n\nScientists believe the cat, as with other Nazca animal figures, was created by making depressions in the desert floor, leaving coloured earth exposed.\n\nThe cat then went unnoticed until plans were recently drawn up for a new path leading to an observation platform.\n\nThe platform would have provided a vantage point for visitors to see many of the other geoglyphs.\n\nIn a statement, Peru's culture ministry said:\"The figure was scarcely visible and was about to disappear, because it's situated on quite a steep slope that's prone to the effects of natural erosion.\"\n\nIt added that the geoglyph, which is about 37m (120ft) long, has been cleaned and conserved over the past week.\n\nJohny Isla, Peru's chief archaeologist for the Nazca lines, told Efe news agency that the cat pre-dates the Nazca culture - which created most of the figures from 200 to 700 AD.\n\nThe cat, he said, was actually from the late Paracas era, which was from 500 BC to 200 AD. \n\n\"We know that from comparing iconographies,\"he said.\"Paracas textiles, for example, show birds, cats and people that are easily comparable to these geoglyphs.\"\nTL;DR: The figure of a relaxing cat has been discovered in the Nazca desert in Peru.\n\nArticle: Parent Centrica has been trialling a digital-only\"challenger\"brand under the name British Gas X amid the highly competitive world of energy supply.\n\nThe company has been shedding customers and this month said it would cut 5,000 jobs.\n\nCentrica would not comment but is expected to give more details in July. \n\nA test website for British Gas X is already up and running.

His family are still awaiting the outcome of a Health and Safety Executive investigation into the death.\n\nSpeaking after the inquest, Mr Singh's son Kuldip Bhele said his death was \"something we will never get over but it's something we will just have to learn to live with\".\n\nNylacast said in a statement:\"The company and staff remain deeply affected and saddened by the tragic events leading to the death of one of our long-standing and highly respected colleagues and friends.\"\nTL;DR: A firm has been criticised over the death of a factory worker who was hit by a piece of machinery.\n\nArticle: The medal, which was found in a drawer, had belonged to Elsie Wolff Van Sandau.\n\nMiss Sandau was arrested after allegedly smashing a window during an organised campaign on 4 March 1912 and later went on hunger strike.\n\nThe medal for valour will be auctioned on 27 June in Derbyshire and is estimated to go for \u00a37,000 to \u00a310,000.\n\nMiss Sandau had also been arrested on 18 November 1910 during the Black Friday riots, where about 300 suffragettes met a wall of policemen outside Parliament.\n\nHeavily outnumbered, the women were assaulted by both police and male vigilantes in the crowd. Many sustained serious injuries and two women died as a result. More than 100 suffragettes were arrested.\n\nThe auctioneers said they did not know what happened to Miss Sandau after the trial and hunger strike.\n\nMiss Sandau's medal, from the Women's Social & Political Union, was discovered in a house in East Sheen, south-west London, by sisters Anne Alford, of Twickenham, and Joan Woolman, 61, from Leicestershire, while clearing out their father's house.\n\nAlthough they remember the medal from decades ago, the sisters said they were unclear about its connection to their family.\n\nMrs Alford, 64, said two great aunts lived with their family and they wondered if they may have known Miss Sandau or been connected to the suffragette movement.\n\nMrs Alford said her parents and two great aunts are no longer alive.\n\nShe said:\"I've done as much research as I can about Elsie, but how our family came to own the medal is something of a mystery.\"\n\nIt will be sold on 27 June at Hansons Auctioneers in Etwall.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

His friend Alok Madasani, also from India, and an American were hurt. \n\nAdam Purinton has been charged with premeditated first-degree murder.\n\nThe killing dominated news bulletins in India and social media, where some blamed Donald Trump's presidency.\n\nMr Kuchibhotla's wife, Sunayana Dumala, described her husband as a\"loveable soul\".\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, she described the US as\"the country that he loved so much\"and called the shooting a\"hate crime\".\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said that any loss of life was tragic but that it would be absurd to link events to Mr Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe FBI is now investigating possible motives for the crime at Austins Bar and Grill, with race among them. Witnesses said that just before opening fire the gunman shouted:\"Get out of my country.\"\n\nA barman also told local media that the attacker used racial slurs before the shooting on Wednesday night.\n\nMr Kuchibhotla and Mr Madasani, both aged 32, were engineers at US technology company Garmin. The two studied initially in India and later took postgraduate degrees in the US.\n\nMr Madasani has now been released from hospital.\n\nThe other injured man, Ian Grillot, 24, said he was shot while intervening to try and stop the violence.\n\nSpeaking from his hospital bed, he brushed aside suggestions that he was a hero. \n\n\"I was just doing what anyone should have done for another human being,\"he said. \n\nThe suspect allegedly fled on foot and was arrested five hours later at a restaurant just over the state border, 80 miles (130km) away in Clinton, Missouri.\n\nHe told a bartender there that he had just killed two Middle Eastern men, the Kansas City Star reported without naming its sources. \n\nMr Kuchibhotla was from the Indian city of Hyderabad. His parents, Madhusudhan Rao and Vardhini Rao, were too stunned by news of his death to comment, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMr Madasani's father, Jaganmohan Reddy, called it a hate crime.\n\nAfter the shooting, Indian actor Siddharth tweeted to his 2.6m followers:\"Don't be shocked! Be angry! Trump is spreading hate. This is a hate crime! RIP #SrinivasKuchibhotla.\"\n\nAt the scene: Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Olathe, Kansas\n\nFor Sunayana Dumala, the grief of losing the man she loved is still raw.\n\n\"Only good things happen to good people,\"was a mantra her husband Srinivas Kutchibhotla used to utter. \n\nSince his fatal shooting on Wednesday, these words are hard for Sunayana to comprehend. \n\nAs she addressed a news conference in Olathe, the place she's made home, she revealed her concerns about living in the United States, telling the room she had experienced racism in the past.\n\nShe called on the US government to do more to stop hate crimes. \n\nIt's still unclear what caused her husband's killer to pull the trigger. But this loss has left Sunayana and her friends and family questioning their place in the United States. \n\nFollow Rajini's updates from Kansas\n\nIndian consular officials have been sent to Kansas City to meet Mr Madasani and arrange the repatriation of Mr Kuchibhotla's body.\n\nThe Indian consul general, Anupam Ray, told the BBC:\"We would like to reassure the Indian community that this is being personally monitored at the highest level by Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj from Delhi.\"\n\nThe US Embassy in Delhi decried the shooting. \n\n\"The United States is a nation of immigrants and welcomes people from across the world to visit, work, study, and live,\"said Charge d'Affaires MaryKay Carlson. \n\n\"US authorities will investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case, though we recognise that justice is small consolation to families in grief.\"\n\nMr Purinton, 51, was extradited to Kansas on Friday.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign set up by a friend to support Mr Kuchibhotla's family has already raised more than $493,000 (\u00a3396,000) after donations poured in from thousands of people.\n\nA separate appeal to pay for Mr Grillot's medical costs has raised more than $214,000. \n\nA vigil held at a Baptist church close to Austins Bar and Grill brought together many people from the local Indian community for an inter-faith service.\n\nIt ended with everyone singing Stand By Me and holding candles, our correspondent reports.\n\nA community shaken - Brajesh Upadhyay, BBC Hindi, Washington\n\nThe attack has drawn a strong response in the Indian media, with most calling it a hate crime. \"The president now has blood on his hands\", one headline said.\n\nThe same outlets have also lauded the American man who tried to help the engineers and suffered bullet wounds. He's been called a hero.\n\nMany in the Indian community in the US have voiced concerns over Mr Trump's diatribes against Muslims and foreign workers accused of stealing American jobs. Such statements have led to anxiety among the thousands of Indian technology workers who have come to the US.\n\nThere's generally been a belief in the community that Indians have gelled well into mainstream America and will not be targeted. That belief may have been shaken, if not totally shattered, by this shooting.\nTL;DR: India has expressed shock after the fatal shooting of an Indian national in the US, amid reports that the attack may have been racially motivated.\n\nArticle: Giant books will be projected onto the facade and whenever a book is chosen from a carousel below, it will appear on the walls with its own animation.\n\nThe display takes place on 16 and 17 May and the library, which was shut for two years, opens on 17 May.\n\nA month-long literary festival is also being held in celebration.\n\nThe In Other Words festival, which starts with a World Book Night event on 23 April, will include shows from broadcaster Lord Bragg and journalist Janet Street-Porter.\n\n'Sense of wonder'\n\nAs part of the digital light display, a carousel containing copies of the books shown on the wall will be placed outside the library.\n\nWhen members of the public pick a book it will come to life on the wall - for example if Alice in Wonderland is selected, Alice will be seen leaping from window to window, peering into the newly refurbished building.\n\nThe show runs from 21:15 until 22:00 BST on May 16, and from 21:15 BST until midnight on May 17.\n\nLiverpool City Council's cabinet member for culture and tourism, Councillor Wendy Simon, said the event is\"a fantastic way to mark this cultural gem's new lease of life\".  \n\nShe added:\"There is a huge amount of anticipation around the re-opening of Central Library and we want to make it a special event.\"\n\nRob Vale, from digital projection experts Illuminos, said:\"Through the projection artwork we're hoping to bring the building to life, to catch some of that sense of wonder that we can all experience when we open a book and our imaginations run wild.\"\nTL;DR: Liverpool's Central Library building will be lit up with an interactive digital display to celebrate its re-opening after a \u00a350m refurbishment.\n\nArticle: It also found that adults are still eating too much saturated fat and not enough fruit, vegetables and fibre.\n\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health called the results\"extremely worrying\".\n\nPublic Health England said it would be challenging the food industry to cut sugar by 20% in its products.\n\nIt maintained this would help to reduce child obesity levels.\n\nThe National Diet and Nutrition Survey, funded by Public Health England and the UK Food Standards Agency, has been run for the past six years collecting data on diet across the UK.\n\nThese latest results were from a survey of 1,288 adults and 1,258 children who completed a three or four-day food diary between 2012 and 2014.\n\nSugary drinks drop\n\nAlthough sugar intake in children is still too high, there was a slight drop in the volume of sugary drinks consumed among four to 10-year-olds - from 130ml per day in 2008-10 to 100ml in 2012-14.\n\nBut sugar still makes up 13% of children's daily calorie intake and 15% of teenagers' daily diet - much more than the 5% recommended limit.\n\nAdults consume a high level of sugar too, making up 12% of their diets on average.\n\nThese figures have remained more or less the same since 2008.\n\nHow much sugar should we eat?\n\nWhen it comes to fruit and vegetables, only 8% of 11 to 18-year-olds meet the five-a-day portions recommendation.\n\nOn average, teenagers manage just 2.8 portions per day while adults eat about four portions.\n\nThe survey found that people in the UK continue to consume too much saturated fat.\n\nChildren aged four to 10 have diets in which 13% of their daily calorie intake comes from saturated fat, compared with a target of under 11%. \n\nThe figure is 12.6% for those aged 11 to 18, while adults get 12.7% of their energy from saturated fat.\n\nAverage intake of red and processed meat should not exceed 70g per day, but men still eat too much while women are reducing the amount they consume.\n\nIndustry challenge\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said the survey showed that everyone needed to eat more fruit, vegetables, fibre and oily fish while cutting back on sugar, salt and saturated fat.\n\nShe said:\"While it is encouraging that young children are having fewer sugary drinks, they still have far too much sugar in their diet overall, along with teenagers and adults.\n\n\"To help tackle this, PHE is launching a programme to challenge the food industry to remove at least 20% of the sugar in its products by 2020. It's an ambitious programme, a world first, and will be a significant step on the road to reducing child obesity levels.\"\n\nOne in three children currently leaving primary school is overweight or obese and there are concerns that in the future more adults will increase their risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.\n\nAdvertising ban\n\nProf Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:\"The results of this survey are extremely worrying.\n\n\"This is why we are surprised the long-awaited UK government childhood obesity strategy did not include a number of recommendations aimed at protecting children, such as a ban on advertising junk food and limiting their sale around schools.\"\n\nShe called for the measures to be reconsidered.\nTL;DR: Children aged four to 10 are consuming twice as much sugar as they should be and teenagers three times as much, a national survey of diets has found.\n\nArticle: Blood plasma, particularly from men who have had a severe bout of the disease, contains antibodies that may be able to protect others.\n\nA pop-up plasma-donation centre, set up in Ashford at the end of December, has already received around 100 samples.\n\nAnd more than 1,000 people in the area have registered an interest.\n\nNHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) says a constant supply of blood plasma will be needed for the trials and also - if they are successful - as stock to treat patients.\n\nIt is co-ordinating what it says is the world's largest randomised clinical trial of convalescent plasma.\n\nNHSBT uses samples from people who have had severe bouts of Covid and are therefore likely to have sufficient antibodies to help other patients fight the disease.\n\nHundreds of patients with Covid have already received the transfusions as part of the trials.\n\nAshford's County Square shopping centre is one of 14 pop-up sites.\n\nMen aged over 35 tend to have the most antibodies, and researchers are particularly keen for volunteers among the black, Asian and minority-ethnic (Bame) community, who appear to be at disproportionate risk from the disease.\n\nA spokeswoman for NHSBT said the initial response since Kent's only donation centre opened less than two weeks ago had been encouraging, but she called for more donors to come forward.\n\nHow to donate\n\nFollow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

I'd never seen it before... you fear it as a father,\"he said on a special evening edition of Good Morning Britain.\n\nDyer also lashed out at former Prime Minister David Cameron's role in the Brexit referendum.\n\n\"How come he can scuttle off?\"he said.\"He brought all this on. Where is he? He's in Nice, with his trotters up.\"\n\nHe added:\"Where is the geezer? I think he should be held accountable for it.\"\n\nDyer was also asked by Susanna Reid how he felt watching his daughter\"being seduced on national television\".\n\n\"It's a nutty thing,\"he said about the ITV2 reality programme.\"It is what it is. It's a game show.\"\n\nHe added:\"Fifty grand's at stake - that's a lot of dough. And Dani's gonna win it.\"\n\nThe show sees a group of\"sexy singletons\"try to couple up and convince the public to keep them on the island, in order to win the big prize.\n\nDyer told Reid's Good Evening Britain co-presenter Piers Morgan, who has openly criticised the show for several weeks, that his daughter has not\"put a foot wrong\".\n\n\"I did struggle at first, it was difficult,\"he said.\n\n\"But as it's gone on, I think what she's done is she's proved with this reality TV thing that actually you can be a decent girl, with self-respect, dignity, not be rolling under the bedsheets, still have respect off the man and be loved and adored by young people.\"\n\nMorgan asked Dyer about his daughter's career and whether he would have preferred it if she had\"done it the hard yards way, gone to drama school, learned the craft?\"\n\nDyer responded by saying:\"She's a talented actress. I've had my moments with reality TV as well, and it is an instant thing at the moment. It is a career. \n\n\"Some of these young kids, they can't be bothered with that real struggle, that rejection in acting, it's a tough thing, and so why not go and try and do something like this Love Island? Everyone's talking about it. She can earn loads of money and crack right on. \n\n'Paternal concern'\n\n\"So who am I to judge? Get hold of that Piers, eat it!\"he said, prompting laughter from Morgan.\n\nMorgan responded by saying:\"We won't agree on Love Island, but I understand your paternal concern for your daughter.\"\n\nDyer added that Dani's new boyfriend on the show, Jack Fincham,\"seems like a good kid\".\n\nWednesday's episode was ITV2's most-watched programme ever, peaking at 3.4 million viewers, with an audience share of 15.8%, according to ITV's spokesman.\n\nThese figures are up by 1.3 million compared with last year's equivalent episode. \n\nGood Evening Britain - broadcast at the same time as Love Island - was aired on ITV just after England were beaten 1-0 by Belgium in the World Cup. \n\nOther guests on the show included Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, actress Pamela Anderson, boxer Amir Khan, former politician Ed Balls and comic Daliso Chaponda.\n\nPiers Morgan claimed a ratings victory, thanking viewers for\"restoring his faith in humanity\"by tuning in.\n\n\"Good Evening Britain peaked at 5.2m viewers last night, smashing Love Island which peaked at just 3.6m. Thanks for watching!\"he tweeted.\n\nHowever, the audience trailed off sharply as the show went on, and average audiences tell a different story.\n\nLove Island reached an average of 3.116m viewers across the whole show, compared with Good Evening Britain's 3.103m - a difference of 13,000.\n\nBoth figures were dwarfed by the average audience for England's third World Cup match, which came to just over 13 million.\n\nWho really won the ratings battle?\n\nBBC News entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba\n\nCertainly when it comes to the average number of viewers, which is the standard benchmark, Love Island just edged ahead of Good Evening Britain.\n\nBut is it true that GEB had a peak of 5.2 million viewers? Almost certainly not.\n\nAfter the England vs Belgium final whistle, the number of ITV viewers was plummeting rapidly throughout the post-match coverage from a high of 14.6 million. Something that unsurprisingly continued when that came off air at 21:15 BST with adverts then kicking in.\n\n5.2 million is the average number of viewers who were watching the channel between 21:15 and 21:20. GEB is advertised as starting at 21:15 but didn't actually begin until after 21:19, so the number of people watching the first minute of the show is almost certainly lower than the figure of 5.2 million, with the opening titles likely to be the most popular part of the programme at just under 5 million.\n\nThat's still more than the Love Island peak of 3.6 million. But whereas millions of viewers flocked to Love Island as soon as it started and stayed with it, Good Evening Britain inherited an already large, declining audience, and continued that trend. By the time it came off air, GEB had lost close to 70% of the audience it started with.\n\nThe one-off special was definitely a winner on social media, though, and Danny Dyer's take on Brexit has gone viral. One online video of his comments has racked up 4.5 million views, ensuring the show is reaching even more eyeballs and getting people talking.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

We're changing ocean chemistry faster than it's changed for tens - maybe hundreds - of millions of years.\n\nOur Newsnight team joined an international research boat on an expedition to the far tip of Papua New Guinea. \n\nI tug on my wetsuit, 3mm thick. I'm about to see the effects of CO2 for myself. They say I only need a stinger suit - a hooded nylon onesie - to shield me from the deadly box jellyfish. But I feel the cold.\n\nI flop into the lukewarm water from the platform at the back of the boat, and fin slowly towards the volcanic CO2 vents.\n\nThe sea bed is a wondrous sight. The afternoon sun illuminates the bubbles as they race towards the surface, encasing them in globules of radiant light. \n\nIt's like swimming in a sea of lemonade.\n\nI run a hand through a column of bubbles as it shoots from the sand, half expecting it to hurt. It doesn't harm me, of course - the bubbles are only CO2. But their acidity is inarguably hurting the local sea life.\n\nOnly tough old boulder corals can survive here. The beautiful branching corals which adorn a nearby uncontaminated reef can't cope.  \n\nIt's a huge loss because the branching corals play a vital role in the reef ecosystem, protecting the young fish needed to help feed a hungry world population. \n\nResearch at the volcanic vents shows that between 30-50% of coral types won't be able to cope with the CO2 levels expected for the world's oceans this century.\n\nThe lead scientist, Katharina Fabricius from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, tells me:\"There will be winners and losers as ocean acidity increases. Seaweed and seagrass are thriving under higher CO2 levels. But many species lose out.\n\n\"We are very concerned because the baby corals find it very hard to survive in high CO2 so reefs won't be able to repair themselves. It's very, very serious.\"\n\nOur cameras capture one experiment revealing a startling disparity in the number of species between the normal CO2 area and the high CO2 vents.\n\nThere's no comparable place to assess how reef creatures are affected by increasing CO2 so there's sharp competition for places on the research vessel, The Chertan. It's just 18m (59ft) long and while there are nine scientists there are only seven beds. Volunteers sleep on the floor.\n\nIt's a fast-expanding area of science, and Fabricius is one of several researchers working in laboratories to see how creatures deal with high CO2 and the elevated temperatures predicted to accompany it.\n\nTerry Hughes, director of the Centre for Reef Studies at James Cook University in Australia says acidification is the latest threat to reefs. \n\n\"We've already lost a third of coral reefs thanks primarily to pollution and overfishing - both are accelerating. Now there's the added impost (sic) of global warming and in future, ocean acidification.\n\n\"I'm very worried about acidification. Some coral species will substitute for others, but if you lose table corals and tall branching corals, most of nooks and crannies - the hiding places for juvenile fish - will disappear. And it'll directly affect humans being because fish stocks will be affected.\"\n\nResearch on acidification  is now spreading from corals to fish. One group of scientists at the university is chasing fish in a barrel to see if their athleticism is compromised by water that could be 170% more acidic than pre-industrial times by the century's end (although still alkaline overall).\n\nAlready tests show acidification makes some fish lose their sense of smell and behave recklessly in the presence of predators. \n\nA draft UN report also warns that mass extinctions happened in the past, when CO2 levels changed more slowly than they are changing now.\n\n\"The changes we're making are irreversible for tens of thousands of years,\"Fabricius tells me as the sun sets over the dugout canoes heading home after a day's fishing.\n\n\"We can protect reefs from over-fishing and local pollution if there's a will. But with the atmosphere and oceans it's completely different - there's nothing to remove the effects of CO2 from the system. It's terrible.\"\n\n Follow Roger on Twitter @RHarrabin\n\nWatch Roger's report on Newsnight at 22:30 GMT on BBC Two  on Thursday 27 March (camera Matt Leiper, producer Nick Blakemore)\n\nFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook\nTL;DR: Off the remote eastern tip of Papua New Guinea a natural phenomenon offers an alarming glimpse into the future of the oceans, as increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere make sea water more acidic.\n\nArticle: Zoey Davies, from Kempston, Bedfordshire, said they felt\"cursed\"as the Lanzarote holiday was to replace a trip lost when Thomas Cook collapsed. \n\nThey were due to fly back on Saturday but their easyJet flight was cancelled amid new measures announced by the Spanish government.\n\nThe airline said rescue flights were operating.\n\nMs Davies said:\"It's been a nightmare.\"\n\n\"I'm losing the will to live.

Czechs can have a beer\n\nThe beer-loving Czechs can finally get back into pubs, albeit with social distancing and mask-wearing indoors. It is the country with the highest per capita beer consumption in the world.\n\nMonday marks the final stage in the Czech Republic's staged easing of lockdown.\n\nIt has been hit far less hard by coronavirus than several other European countries, but was the first to make mask-wearing in public compulsory. It is not clear how strictly mask-wearing can be enforced indoors while people are eating and drinking.\n\n2. Spaniards can visit museums\n\nSpain had one of Europe's toughest lockdowns but in the big cities parks, museums and other cultural centres are reopening under the country's four-phase easing of restrictions.\n\nThere are strict limits on numbers: indoor sites can only operate at one-third capacity, while outdoor events are limited to a maximum crowd of 200.\n\nPhase one of easing covers more than half of the population and includes Spain's two main cities, Madrid and Barcelona. In both bars are now allowed to open terraces at 50% capacity and people can meet in groups of up to 10.\n\nPreviously Spaniards were allowed to leave home for exercise only during certain time slots, in an area close to home and according to age group. Now joggers have returned to Madrid's famous Retiro Park.\n\nBut free movement is not allowed between Barcelona and its wider metropolitan area. \n\nOther regions are entering phase two of easing which will see beaches and swimming pools reopening.\n\n3. Italians can go for a swim\n\nItaly is reopening gyms and swimming pools, but with strict hygiene and social distancing rules. \n\nBesides Lombardy, the reopening is also being delayed in Basilicata in the south and in Bologna.

Greeks can visit islands \n\nGreece is opening up its many islands to travellers from the mainland, but not to foreign tourists yet.\n\nIt means many Greeks with island holiday homes can get to their places to relax - and support the struggling local economy. It is a relief for many after two months of lockdown.\n\nIt is also an important step towards restarting the wider tourism industry, which makes up at least one-fifth of the Greek economy. \n\nLast week, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the country would open up to international tourism from 15 June. He said most flights to Greece would resume by 1 July, when seasonal hotels will reopen and a two-week quarantine for foreigners will no longer be in force.\n\nSpain's government says the country will reopen its borders to international tourism from July, when the current two-week quarantine requirement for foreign visitors will be lifted. Tourism accounts for more than 12% of Spain's economic output.\n\nItaly is also due to reopen its borders to foreign tourists from 3 June.\n\n5.

Those who do tend to pay for it. \n\nHardliners have made it clear they are angry and disappointed. Some have called Mr Ahmadinejad's move\"unacceptable\"and said it will spell the end of his political career. \n\nAll potential candidates have to be vetted by the Guardian Council and many observers believe Mr Ahmadinejad will not pass this hurdle. \n\nBut if he does, his entry into the race is likely to take some of the shine off the hardliners' preferred candidate, Ebrahim Raisi. \n\nIt will also be damaging to President Rouhani - especially with poorer voters who have yet to feel the effects of promised economic improvements following the nuclear deal, and could be swayed by Mr Ahmadinejad's populist rhetoric and promises to bring back subsidies to help people cope with inflation.\n\n\"I registered merely to support Baghaei and I will act according to the [supreme] leader's advice,\"he said.\"I'll be serving Mr Baghaei with all my power.\"\n\nHe added:\"Some people say that the [supreme leader's] advice was meant to completely forbid [me from running], but what the leader said was just advice... I am still committed to my moral promise.\"\n\nAyatollah Khamenei, who holds ultimate power over Iran's civil and religious affairs, said he had told him not to stand because it would\"create bipolar opposites and divisions in the country which I believe is harmful\".\n\nThe disputed re-election of Mr Ahmadinejad in 2009 triggered the biggest protests in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. \n\nMillions of people demanded a re-run, but the supreme leader insisted the result was valid and ordered a major crackdown on dissent that saw dozens of opposition supporters killed and thousands detained.\n\nAnalysts said Mr Ahmadinejad might be trying to put pressure on the Guardian Council not to disqualify Mr Baghaei, as it did with his former chief-of-staff in 2013.\n\nMr Baghaei was detained for seven months in 2015 on unspecified charges. In March, the judiciary said the case was still open, Reuters news agency reports.\nTL;DR: Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has registered as a candidate in Iran's presidential election, despite being told not to by the Supreme Leader.\n\nArticle: The existence of the microphone was revealed when Google announced that it would be enabling voice-activated features on the home alarm product\n\nThe company then apologised for not disclosing the fact earlier, saying it had not been used\"up to this point\".\n\nNow, senators are asking chief executive Sundar Pichai to clarify.\n\n\"In recent years, consumers have become increasingly concerned about the ability of large technology companies to collect and use personal data about them without their knowledge,\"the letter reads.\n\n\"Therefore, it is critically important that companies like Google be completely transparent with consumers, and provide full disclosure of all technical specifications of their products at the point of sale.\"\n\nIt added that Google's failure to disclose the microphone's existence\"raises serious questions about its commitment to consumer transparency and disclosure\".\n\nGoogle has said that the microphone was\"never intended as a secret\"and it was an error that it was not listed on the technical specifications.\n\nBut the three senators have asked for more information, including:\n\nThe letter was signed by:\n\nThe product in question is Nest Guard, one of Google's Nest Secure range of home security products.\n\nThe alarm and motion sensor will now be compatible with Google Assistant.\n\nThe senators have asked Google for a written response by 12 March.\nTL;DR: US senators have written to Google asking for more details about revelations that a hidden microphone had been built into its Nest devices.\n\nArticle: By Tom EdgingtonBBC Reality Check\n\nDefeats in the order of 100-plus votes are very rare. The three biggest government losses, according to the Institute for Government think tank, all occurred in 1924 when the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald was defeated by margins of 166, 161 and 140.\n\nThe defeats of 166 and 161 votes both occurred on 8 October 1924 and related to the response to the government's decision to drop criminal proceedings against John Ross Campbell, editor of the Communist newspaper Workers' Weekly.\n\nA few weeks afterwards, a general election was held - following a motion of no confidence in the government. That election saw the Conservatives gain more than 150 seats with Stanley Baldwin returning to power.\n\nThe third biggest defeat also happened in 1924 when the government suffered a 140-vote defeat on its Housing Bill on 3 June.\n\nThere may be special circumstances around certain votes, so it's not always easy to compare each one - says Alice Lilly from the Institute for Government.\n\nGovernments, she says, have, on occasion, chosen not to take part in certain votes - meaning the scale of defeat was much larger than it otherwise would have been.\n\nFor example, in March 1977 Labour lost a vote by 293-0 on public spending cuts to pay for a 1976 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  In that instance, party managers instructed Labour MPs not to take part. \n\nOther votes might be\"free\", meaning that MPs are not put under pressure to vote a certain way by their party leaders. Usually such votes happen on ethical issues that are seen as a matter of conscience, such as the same-sex marriage vote.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected in the House of Commons by 230 votes.

He quit UKIP last year, following Mr Farage's decision to leave the organisation.\n\n\"We have none of the past problems that UKIP had,\"Mr Gill, who leads the Brexit Party list for Wales, said.\n\n\"We are just about making sure that Brexit is delivered, and that's what people voted for, that's what they wanted, that's what they expected.\n\n\"That's what we all thought was going to happen on the 29th of March, and here we are, three years after we voted to leave, and we're being asked to vote in the European election - it's unbelievable.\"\n\nThe European Parliament elections in Wales\n\nThere are eight parties fighting for four seats in the planned European elections in May.\n\nWelsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Liberal Democrats, UKIP and the Green Party are joined by Change UK and the Brexit Party.\n\nYou can find a list of candidates here.\nTL;DR: The main UK political parties have \"wilfully decided to go against\" the 2016 EU referendum result, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said.\n\nArticle: Garth Wright, 95, from Plymouth, also unveiled a new memorial plaque on Plymouth Hoe.\n\nIn 1940, hundreds of boats set sail to rescue hundreds of thousands of Allied troops who had retreated from Hitler's forces on to the shores of Dunkirk.\n\n\"We went across to France, we defended Dunkirk and the evacuation,\"said Mr Wright.\n\nAlmost 99,000 men were lifted from the beaches and about 240,000 from the harbour and mole - a wooden breakwater protecting the harbour - but thousands died.\n\nMr Wright said:\"I hope and I'm sure that in future years, when youngsters hear about Dunkirk, they'll come and see this plaque.\"\n\nHe added it had been a\"great day\"and he had\"achieved a mission\"to have the new plaque installed.\nTL;DR: One of the last surviving Dunkirk veterans led a 75th anniversary service to mark the World War Two evacuation.\n\nArticle: By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter \n\n\"Research scientist\",\"teacher\",\"civil engineer\", call out a group of bubbly teenagers chatting about what they want to be when they grow up.\n\nOne of the Hastings Academy pupils is even planning two careers - as a university lecturer and an author. And another has her eye on a course at Oxford University. \n\nThey don't come across as youngsters held back by their backgrounds. The sky's the limit.\n\nBut according to Ofsted, they are being taught in a coastal area which tends not to serve its poorest pupils as well as it could.\n\nThe academy, sponsored by Brighton University, is rated good by the education inspectorate and is in the middle of an impressive rebuild. It's on an upward trajectory.\n\nDespite having just over half of its pupils from very poor backgrounds, and eligible for free school meals (FSM), there is a strong sense of is energy, determination and aspiration.\n\nThe group that performs least well at GCSEs in England is white boys from poor backgrounds. Nationally, some 26% of these boys on FSM get five good GCSEs including English and maths but at Hastings Academy, 46% of that group achieve that.\n\nPrincipal Theresa Phillips says:\"We do not accept at Hastings Academy that your future is determined by your parental income.\"\n\nBut that does not mean there are not significant problems that schools like hers have to work hard to overcome.\n\nShe explains:\"The group who arrive from primary school behind the average level of achievement are the pupils on free school meals.\"\n\nSo how do they help these youngsters catch up and even surpass expectations?\n\n'Negative image'\n\nHer\"inspirational staff\"challenge pupils to aim high with what she describes as a\"single-minded determination\", she says.\n\nAnd in a coastal town with what one teacher described as a\"pretty negative seaside end-of-the-pier image\", it is not always easy to attract the best staff.\n\nMrs Phillips says:\"It is challenging to recruit, particularly in the core subjects. There are not many applications for posts and we often have to readvertise. \n\n\"It requires a great deal of perseverance to wait until the exceptional candidate comes along,\"she adds. \n\nSome if this has to do with transport networks, she says, but also perhaps the overall lack of investment in the town in the past.\n\nThe school also uses money from the government's Catch Up Premium - aimed at those starting secondary school behind in English or maths  - to provide one-to-one support and small group tuition. \n\nCommunity feel\n\nAnd it uses funds from the pupil premium - a pot of money aimed specifically at children from low-income homes - to support families of children that are at risk of underachievement.\n\nThe school also puts its success at overcoming the odds down to its relationship with its key sponsor, Brighton University. \n\nThe link has undoubtedly raised aspirations in itself, she says.\n\nBut it is its idea of developing four schools within the one larger academy that has given the 750-pupil academy a more homely and supportive feel.\n\nPartnership manager Amanda Crisford says this means pupils can be tracked and mentored carefully through that that tricky transition from primary school - the key time when pupils can drift and lose their way academically.\n\n\"The academy is broken into four individual communities of 220 pupils. They act as a social and emotional base for pupils.\"\n\nThe children register physically in their particular schools every morning and break into 15-pupil all-age tutor groups where progress and wellbeing are constantly reviewed. Each school is led by its own vice-principal and the intimacy between staff and pupils is palpable.\n\nJim Cameron - vice-principal for one of the schools, West Hill - says when it comes to all-important GCSE time, the candidates get a much higher level of support than if 150 children were in the hands of one single head of year.\n\nHead girl Georgia is clear what has made the difference for her at school:\"They started telling us quite young that we would achieve.\"\n\nShe has never felt her background or the area she comes from have held her back.\n\nInstead, she says:\"Because we are from a deprived background we have to work harder to get further in our education. So in a sense coming from a deprived background has pushed us further.\"\nTL;DR: As Ofsted warns some coastal and shire town schools are failing their poorest pupils, Hannah Richardson visits a school in Hastings which is bucking the trend.\n\nArticle: Nick Milligan, 51, and daughter Emily, eight, were killed after they and the rest of their family were thrown out of their vessel near Padstow in Cornwall.\n\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said the unnamed driver was not using the vessel's kill cord.\n\nThe cord clips the driver to the boat and cuts the engine if they fall out.\n\nRunaway boat\n\nInvestigators still do not know why all six members of the Milligan family were flipped out of their speedboat over the May Day Bank Holiday weekend.\n\nBut the engine continued running and\"as the boat circled, it ran over the family in the water a number of times\", said the initial MAIB report.\n\nBSkyB executive Mr Milligan and his daughter Emily were killed. \n\nHis wife Victoria, 39, had her left leg amputated below the knee.\n\nMrs Milligan and their four-year-old son Kit will need further surgery.\n\nThey have been transferred from Derriford Hospital in Plymouth to a hospital in London.\n\nThe Milligans' two elder daughters, Amber and Olivia, received minor injuries in the accident.\n\nThe runaway boat was brought under control by water skiing instructor Charlie Toogood who leapt from his own boat into the craft to turn off its engine.\n\nA statement from the Milligan family, who own a holiday home at Daymer Bay near Padstow, said:\"We are grateful for the continued support of our family and friends and the good wishes we have received from the public.\"\n\nBoat owners are not obliged by law to use a kill cord but accident investigators hope the case will encourage more of them to do so.\n\nA man whose son was killed by a runaway speedboat 13 years ago said the Padstow deaths showed new laws were needed to make the cords mandatory.\n\nTristan Douglas-Johnson, from Dorchester in Dorset, died at the Southampton International Boat Show in 2000 when he was thrown from a speedboat and run over as it circled in the water.

The number last year was the same as in 1983.\n\nThe figures also show attempted murders also fell substantially, indicating that the fall in homicides was not principally because surgeons were saving people's lives through advances in medical techniques, said BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw.\n\nThe\"other thefts\"category also included people stealing items from garages and sheds and rose 4% the previous year.  More than 1.1 million such incidents were recorded by police last year.\n\nJohn Flatley, head of crime statistics at the ONS, suggested the increase was mostly driven by rises in thefts of metal, mobile phones and bags left unattended in pubs and bars.\n\nHe added the CSEW indicated that pickpocketing had risen 17% in the last two years and this\"might represent an emerging upward trend mirroring that seen in the comparable recorded crime category\".\n\nMr Flatley said the estimated 5,000 offences committed during last summer's riots had been\"swallowed up by the larger volume reductions we've seen elsewhere\".\n\nThe recorded crime figures also show:\n\nPolicing Minister Nick Herbert said the figures showed crime has continued to fall despite the challenge of reduced police budgets and\"give the lie to the spurious claim that there is a simple link between overall police numbers and the crime rate\".\n\nHe said the introduction of elected police commissioners in November would make forces more accountable for\"areas of local concern\"highlighted by the ONS.\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said the figures were a\"credit to those officers and staff who have faced the challenge of major efficiencies while continuing to tackle crime in our communities\".\n\nSeparate crime figures were previously released by the Scottish Government and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In 2011-12, Scotland's eight police forces recorded 3% fewer crimes than the previous year, while offences in Northern Ireland dropped 1.6% year-on-year.\nTL;DR: The number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, Office for National Statistics figures show.\n\nArticle: By Rahul BediDefence analyst\n\n\"I assure the nation that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished,\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared just hours after the strike.\n\nMr Modi did not name Pakistan, but his response to the attack has boosted those who would like to see a tactical comeback by the Indian army against Pakistan's military, which is being blamed by senior leaders in Delhi for helping launch the attack. \n\nPakistan has denied such allegations, dismissing it as a knee-jerk response by India and no group has said it carried out the killings.\n\nVindicating the'honour' of the army - with force\n\nBut the army is itching to respond to the Uri attack, seeking to kill more than the 17 soldiers it lost, to vindicate its\"izzat\", or honour, in a move guaranteed to escalate tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\nDefence planners in Delhi have long believed, erroneously, that although the Pakistani army controls the nuclear button, India can successfully execute swift punitive strikes against Pakistan without crossing the nuclear threshold. That is without provoking a nuclear strike from the other side. \n\nIndian security officials are of the view that the nuclear escalatory ladder provides'ample opportunity' for Delhi to undertake'swift' military strikes for tactical and political gain, by which time the international community would intervene to prevent an all-out nuclear exchange. \n\nBut this method of action is predicated to speedy action, which almost 24 hours after Sunday's attack, appears distant. \n\nThe recent unrest in Kashmir explained \n\nWhat's behind Kashmir's deadliest militant raid in years?\n\nViewpoint: Living in the shadow of Kashmir\n\nViewpoint: Why mass funerals spark violence in Kashmir\n\nWhy July's Kashmir Killings could have been avoided\n\nConcern over Kashmir police's pellet guns\n\nKashmiri Hindus: Driven out and insignificant\n\nKashmir profile\n\nMeanwhile, security insiders are of the view that the army's\"aggressive school\"is being encouraged by Mr Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's muscular approach in dealing with Pakistan - but that this  approach is not mindful of the broader potential consequences.\n\nThe'strike now' school of thought\n\n\"It's time we snatched the tactical advantage away from Pakistan by countering such an attack and showed them what the Indian army is capable of doing,\"said military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Vijay Kapoor.\n\n\"We have kept our peace for too long and cannot allow terrorist proxies run by the Pakistan army to prevail time and again by attacking us,\"he added.\n\n\"The reaction to the Uri attack must be swift,\"said former army deputy chief of staff Lt Gen Raj Kadiyan.\n\n\"This sort of situation in which we keep getting hit cannot go on indefinitely.\"\n\nSenior army officers, however, are agreed that a calculated response at a time and place of India's choosing should be  dramatic and in direct proportion to the publicity it would generate to appease public and official sentiment over the Uri strike.\n\nThey would prefer to duplicate the special forces raid conducted against two Naga insurgent camps deep inside Myanmar in June 2015, to avenge the killing of 18 soldiers whose convoy was ambushed in Manipur's Chandel district a few days earlier.\n\nAt the time, the army, in connivance with the federal security establishment, even encouraged some special forces personnel on the raid to give media interviews, providing classified operational details in an attempt to vindicate the army's izzat.\n\nBut, as has been pointed out innumerable times since then, such an option is simply not possible with regard to Pakistan.\n\nBesides, military experts argue that any retaliation to the Uri attack would need to be quick, as diplomatic pressure from countries like the US were already kicking in to preclude such an option, leaving little time to manoeuvre or possibilities to pursue.\n\nThe'fire across the line' option for India\n\nOptions too are circumscribed.\n\nThe most obvious one is selective firing across the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border, but that would in effect mean ending the November 2003 bilateral ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe second and possibly only other prospect would be a\"selective fire assault\"across the LoC near Uri, through which the militants infiltrated, to strike at a Pakistani forward base or headquarters. That has, no doubt, been gamed earlier.\n\nBut for this to succeed time would be of the essence, as counter-measures would already be in place on the Pakistani side, so many feel it would already be too late for any such attempt.\n\nThe option to just create diplomatic noise\n\nBut other analysts and military officers differ.\n\nThey believe that despite severe provocation, India, intimidated by Pakistan's trigger-happy nuclear tsars, is incapable of responding militarily to Islamabad, seeking instead the largely ineffective diplomatic and political route to try and chastise it.\n\n\"Over decades, including during the Kargil war, India has always looked to the US and other countries to discipline Pakistan, as there is little it is capable of doing itself,\"said former Major Gen Sheru Thapliyal. Robust, meaningful reaction is certainly not an option it can pursue, he added.\n\n The attack comes just ahead of the UN session in New York in which Pakistan aims to highlight atrocities it alleges have been committed by the Indian security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir. \n\n It recently dispatched 22 of its senior leaders and officials across the world to highlight the Kashmir situation.\n\n India, for its part plans to retaliate by raising human rights issues in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province promising a diplomatic stand-off between the neighbours. \n\nBut what about internal security in the first place? \n\nIn the meantime, the din of the militant attack has somewhat masked the lax security in the Uri cantonment along the LoC, that enabled the strike.\n\nAn inquiry has been launched into it, and will no doubt apportion responsibility and punish those responsible, but many senior officers believe the army is too deeply deployed on internal security operations to remain constantly alert.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the sloppiness in security that resulted in the ambush of an army convoy in Manipur last year. \n\nLittle, it seems, has been learned.\nTL;DR: There are growing demands from India's military for a robust riposte to Pakistan, after  Sunday's dawn attack  by four gunmen which saw 17 soldiers killed at the army's Uri cantonment in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nArticle: Someone tried to steal or kill three chicks at the undisclosed location between about 18:00 BST on Monday and 08:00 on Tuesday, the RSPB said.  \n\nBut the birds escaped and were scattered across the site before being found back together on Wednesday.\n\nThe RSPB said it had talked with quarry staff and was looking at whether it could get 24-hour security in place.\n\n'Anxious period'\n\nPolice are also investigating.\n\nQuarry staff found rope above the nest site following the incident, the charity said.  \n\nAlan Firth, from the RSPB investigations team, said:\"It's been a fairly anxious period until we found them.\n\n\"People need to be aware it is a criminal offence if they disturb a nest of rare breeding birds.\"\n\nThe quarry site had not been disclosed to help protect the nest location, the charity said.\nTL;DR: A nest of protected peregrine falcon chicks has been attacked at a quarry in Staffordshire.\n\nArticle: The Californian rock band were performing at the city's Bataclan Theatre on 13 November when three gunmen stormed in and killed 90 people.\n\nThere had been reports in recent days that the band would join U2 for their last song at their gig in the AccorHotels Arena.\n\nBut U2 published a statement on their website saying:\"This is not the case.\"\n\nThe band added:\"We have another surprise guest planned for tonight's show.\u200e\"\n\nThey're playing two rescheduled concerts on Sunday and Monday evening in Paris.\n\nU2 have written a special song in tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks.\n\nFrontman Bono said the track, called Streets of Surrender, contains lines about Paris being the\"city of liberty\"and having\"streets of love and pride\".\n\nThe group were due to play in Paris days after the attacks, but cancelled like many other bands.\n\nThe Edge tweeted\"Back in Paris\"on Saturday.\n\nLast month, the lead singer of Eagles of Death Metal said he wanted to be the first person to play the Bataclan theatre when it reopens.\n\nSpeaking to Vice, singer Jesse Hughes said he\"cannot wait to get back to Paris and play\".\n\n\"Our friends went to see rock and roll and died.

But Sir Ranulph Fiennes' next foes are likely to be heatstroke and thirst.\n\nIn April he'll take on the Marathon des Sables to raise money for Marie Curie Cancer Care. A 156-mile (251 km) race through the Sahara Desert, it's the equivalent of running five and a half marathons in six days. It is often called the toughest footrace on earth. Competitors must carry all their gear, including a mirror in case they get lost in a sandstorm and anti-venom kit for the snakes and scorpions. There are water stations along the way but with temperatures reaching 50C competitors need to take their own supply as well. \n\nSir Ranulph is best known for icy challenges. He's the first person to reach both poles by surface means and the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nSo which is harder, hot or cold endurance tests?\n\nDr Andrew Murray, fellow of the Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine, has run both polar races and also the Marathon des Sables. In cold climes, every inch of the body needs to be covered to avoid frostbite. Hypothermia is a threat so spare clothes are necessary. Running in snow saps the energy and then there are dangers like crevasses at the South Pole or polar bears at the North Pole. \n\nThe desert is harder though, he says. In the cold you can always wear more clothes to run.\"The human body is good at conserving heat. But it is very difficult to shed heat.\"Heatstroke (when the body goes above 40.6C), is a potential problem. There's the risk of dehydration - fast runners have to slow down to avoid losing more water than they can drink.

What's the difference between hot and cold endurance tests, asks Tom de Castella.\n\nArticle: Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter\n\nToday, the government defines extremism as\"vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs\". \n\nIt goes on to say that Islamist extremism is an ideology that accuses the West of perpetrating a war on Islam.\n\nIf that definition is now clear, it wasn't always so. \n\nBack in the early 1990s, London became a hub for an international network of predominantly Arab Islamist thinkers, many of whom had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan.\n\nThese former fighters were seeking safe havens because their support for Islamic states meant they posed a security threat to the despotic regimes in their own countries. \n\nThey persuaded the UK that they would not pose an extremist threat here and were allowed to settle. \n\nThis uneasy situation didn't last. Jihadists - such as the preacher Abu Hamza -  ultimately supported Osama bin Laden's anti-Western message. The 9/11 attacks served only to convince critics that the UK's security services had made a catastrophic error of judgement and allowed extremism to flourish.\n\nBanned \n\nIn the wake of the later 7/7 attacks on London, Tony Blair's government signalled it would not only hunt down suspected terrorists, but also turn its attention to anyone promoting the ideology that could be linked to violence. \n\nThere were proposals to close extremist mosques, bookshops and other organisations. The government broadened the range of terrorism offences and banned one group whose members had committed terrorism offences. \n\nMany parts of this package were dropped because of disagreements in Whitehall over what constituted extremism.  \n\nFor instance, Tony Blair said he would ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group that supports a single Islamic state. Despite David Cameron making the same pledge while in opposition, the group remains legal to this day. \n\nInside Whitehall, officials tried to work out which community groups were best placed to receive more than \u00a350m earmarked for projects designed to prevent extremism. \n\nBut in hindsight, many of the bets were poorly placed. While many groups took the cash and used it to do some local good, a great deal of them didn't seem to have any means to combat extremism - not least because nobody seemed to agree what it was. \n\nIn the end, a highly critical report from MPs accused the government of alienating some of the many people it was trying to reach. \n\nIntegration or separation?\n\nDavid Cameron came into office with (whether you agree with it or not) a much clearer definition of what constituted extremism. Michael Gove, the education secretary at the centre of the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair, was one of the architects of what became known as the Munich speech. \n\nIn it the PM said the government needed to be\"shrewder\"in dealing with groups that were part of the problem, even if they were not violent themselves. \n\nHe said that groups wishing to work with government had to pass tests such as whether they believed in human rights, including for women, the rule of law and democracy. Did they encourage integration or separation? \n\nIn other words, his definition of extremism comes down to a question of whether society fractures into\"us and them\". \n\nIn that context, it's not hard to see why the Birmingham schools affair has become so important to ministers. \n\nToo extreme\n\nSince the Munich speech, the government has massively cut funding to Muslim community groups that it felt did not meet these tests. \n\nOne of the groups that lost out was a south London-based organisation called Street. It previously had the ear of some in Scotland Yard because it had intervened to stop gang violence and al-Qaeda recruitment. \n\nIn the new landscape, it was deemed to be too extreme because its members tended to follow a very conservative Saudi-influenced interpretation of the faith. \n\nStreet's founder told the BBC last year that the organisation had identified one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby as a possible threat - and he believed he could have been turned away from violence had his group still been operating. \n\nThe prime minister's Extremism Task Force, set up after the murder, doesn't analyse whether the killers could have been stopped. But it cements the government's current broader definition of extremism. \n\nThe definition it uses, outlined at the top of this blog, is much clearer than it once was - and the detailed guidance makes clear that schools should support\"British values\". \n\nSeven years ago, the future Education Secretary Michael Gove wrote that\"there is something rather un-British about seeking to define Britishness\".\n\nHe argued that Britishness was something best demonstrated through action rather than described in abstract terms. \n\nAnd that's why the state of a small number of predominantly Muslim schools in Birmingham, and how the government and other bodies propose to change them, may turn out to be one of the defining moments in modern multicultural Britain.\nTL;DR: The Birmingham Trojan Horse row has reignited a long and difficult debate over defining Islamist extremism.\n\nArticle: More than 85,000 were shifted - up by 7% compared with last year - and 376 tickets were sold every minute in the first hour. \n\nThe series of classical music concerts take place from 15 July at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\nTickets for the other events are still available.\n\nAll the seated tickets for Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra sold out within three hours.\n\nVerdi's Requiem and Havergal Brian's gargantuan Gothic Symphony have also all gone. \n\nHowever, up to 1,400 extra tickets are released on the day of each concert.   \n\nProms director Roger Wright said:\"We're delighted that so many people have been able to get their tickets successfully and look forward to welcoming them to the Proms this summer.\"\nTL;DR:", "test_query": "More than 85,000 were shifted - up by 7% compared with last year - and 376 tickets were sold every minute in the first hour. \n\nThe series of classical music concerts take place from 15 July at London's Royal Albert Hall.\n\nTickets for the other events are still available.\n\nAll the seated tickets for Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra sold out within three hours.\n\nVerdi's Requiem and Havergal Brian's gargantuan Gothic Symphony have also all gone. \n\nHowever, up to 1,400 extra tickets are released on the day of each concert.   \n\nProms director Roger Wright said:\"We're delighted that so many people have been able to get their tickets successfully and look forward to welcoming them to the Proms this summer.\"", "prediction": "More than 85,000 tickets were sold in the first hour for the BBC Proms classical music festival.\n\nSummary:\nThe number of murders and killings in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 30 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The number of homicides recorded by police fell by 4% to below the four million mark for the first time since 1989. Offences such as pickpocketing, shoplifting, and bicycle theft rose 2%, the only crime category to show a rise. Separate data suggests crime levels are broadly flat, with about 9.5 million incidents reported. The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) interviewed 46,000 adults and found that crime levels have not changed significantly. The number of attempted murders also fell substantially, indicating that the fall in homicides was not due to advances in medical techniques. John Flatley, head of crime statistics at the ONS, suggested that the rise in \"other thefts\" was mostly driven by rises in thefts of metal, mobile phones, and bags left unattended in pubs and bars. Policing Minister Nick Herbert said that the figures showed that crime has continued to fall despite the challenge of reduced police budgets and that the introduction of elected police commissioners would make forces more accountable for areas of local concern. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said that the figures were a credit to those officers and staff who have faced the challenge of major efficiencies while continuing to tackle crime in their communities. \nThe BBC Proms classical music festival has sold over 85,000 tickets in the first hour of sales, with all seated tickets for the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra sold out within three hours.

Cambridge-based ARM designs and licenses its chip architectures but does not manufacture processors itself. \n\nIts creations already dominate the smart device market, powering most tablets and smartphones. Licensees including Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.\n\nCloud services\n\nAMD said it already accounted for about 4-5% of the x86-based server market, but had responded to demand for\"denser server clusters\"in which more processors are packed into a smaller space, creating the need for chips that produce less heat and consume less energy.\n\n\"For the energy and space efficiency that the mega-data centres require ARM processors are always the best approach,\"Suresh Gopalakrishnan, general manager of AMD's server division, told the BBC.\n\nHe added that the shift towards smartphones and tablets had led to a rise in demand for such centres as consumers made use of remote computers to provide cloud-based services.\n\n\"People started with music and pictures, now you see firms offering 2GB blocks of storage for free,\"said Mr Gopalakrishnan.\n\n\"A lot of data is being put into the cloud and served onto these tablets and smartphones, and the goal of these devices is to have the longest battery life possible so a lot of the processing gets done in the cloud and then gets sent over into the devices.\"\n\nAMD said it had held off offering an ARM-based product until now while it waited for the British firm to release a 64-bit, rather than 32-bit, design. 64-bit chips can make use of more random access memory (RAM) at once, helping make them faster at dealing with memory-intensive tasks.\n\nSince ARM-based chips produce less heat Mr Gopalakrishnan said more could be placed on each\"pizza-box-shaped\"server rack unit. However, the trade-off is that at present each chip is a less powerful processor than x86-based products on the market.\n\nAs a result he said AMD would focus its new ARM products at servers used to power apps, host websites and carry out data analysis for business. \n\nServers used to stream video, offer cloud-based gaming, carry out facial recognition and other more complicated tasks would be best off using x86-based chips, he added, at least for the next few years.\n\nLicence fees\n\nThe announcement comes during a period of upheaval at AMD. Earlier this month the company announced it was laying off 15% of its staff and warned its third-quarter sales would be weaker than Wall Street had expected.\n\nThe shift towards ARM will incur extra costs as it will have to pay a fee for the use of the British firm's technology - it does not incur such a charge for its x86-based chips.\n\nHowever, one industry watcher said the move was no surprise.\n\n\"The demand for low powered chips is going through the roof,\"said Chris Green, principal technology analyst at consultants Davies Murphy Group Europe.\n\n\"AMD has traditionally offered powerful but power-hungry products and doesn't have the in-house technology to design such chips. \n\n\"But manufacturing ARM-based processors for servers alone wouldn't be cost effective - so I think they will use the server market to perfect the product and then release ARM-based processors for tablets, smartphones and ultralight laptops.\"\nTL;DR: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is to release its first ARM-based chip in 2014.\n\nArticle: BT and CSC were in the running for contracts to run services including libraries, and benefit payments.\n\nIndependent councillor Neil Burden would not identify the company.\n\nConservative leader Alec Robertson was removed following a no confidence vote. One union leader called the deal\"dead in the water\". \n\nMr Robertson was replaced by Conservative councillor Jim Currie, who had previously left the cabinet in protest at plans to involve private enterprise.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Cornwall, Mr Burden said:\"One of the bidders no longer wants to engage with Cornwall Council because of what happened yesterday.\"\n\n'Business goes on'\n\nMr Currie, said:\"I can't tell you anything at all about that. That is part of negotiations that are going on.\n\n\"I am sure things will emerge today, and all will be revealed later.\"\n\nA report to the council claimed the joint venture contract would save at least \u00a32.5m a year.\n\nBut the no-confidence vote was held over the decision to push ahead with the plans, which the full council had voted against.\n\nOne of Mr Currie's first duties in his new role will be to fill gaps left in the council's cabinet.\n\nJulian German, Chris Ridgers, Steve Double and Graeme Hicks resigned from the cabinet after Mr Currie's appointment.\n\nMr Currie said:\"Business goes on. I hope to fill all the posts as soon as possible, possibly by the weekend.\"\n\nHe will only be in post for about six months, as he is standing down at the next full council election in May 2013.\n\nStuart Roden, from the union Unison, said the privatisation plans would not now go ahead.\n\nHe said:\"To end up with one tender would make it unviable to proceed. For practical reasons I think it's dead in the water.\"\nTL;DR: A private company bidding to run some of Cornwall Council's services has pulled out following the ousting of the council leader, its deputy has claimed.\n\nArticle: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said many homeowners found themselves in\"serious traps\"after being misled by housing developers.  \n\nIt said it would take action against firms, calling for a change in the law and for refunds to be paid.\n\nBut it has not disclosed any names so far as it continues to investigate.\n\nThe CMA found some buyers were not told upfront that a property was leasehold and what this meant.  \n\nBy the time people found out the realities of owning a leasehold, including regular ground rent charges, they were often unable to pull out of the sale, or would have found it very difficult. \n\nIn some cases, ground rents doubled every 10 years. This increase is often built into contracts, meaning people can struggle to sell their homes and find themselves trapped. \n\nGeorge Lusty from the CMA told BBC Radio 5 live that people could be in line for refunds.\n\n\"If we can attack and challenge these unfair ground rent terms, then they're invalid - all the money that was collected on them isn't valid and that has to be paid back,\"he said.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to get people out of these really serious traps they find themselves in. \n\n\"People aren't able to take mortgages on these properties. They can't sell them, that's a terrible outcome and absolutely devastating for the people affected.\"\n\nThis could result in firms signing legal commitments to change how they do business, and being taken to court if they do not comply.\n\nThe CMA said there should be a ban on the sale of new leasehold houses, while ground rents for new leases should be slashed to zero.\n\n'Deeply concerning'\n\nConcerns have long been raised by MPs and consumer groups about unfair leasehold contracts, with costly fees or onerous terms, prompting the CMA to announce the investigation last year.\n\nCampaigners have called for leaseholds to be abolished, while some developers say they still have a place.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the findings were\"deeply concerning\".\n\n\"In the past two years, the government has taken more action to stop unfair leasehold practices than ever before - including reducing ground rents to a peppercorn and banning the sale of new leasehold houses.\n\n\"But we know more needs to be done to support leaseholders and the CMA report echoes our commitment to bring forward legislation to reduce ground rents to zero for future leases.\"\n\nJohn Healey MP, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said:\"Labour and leasehold campaigners forced this investigation last year and it confirms the scale of the problems with leasehold mis-selling.\n\n\"Ministers should legislate to stop the sale of new leasehold homes and end the unfair fees and contract terms that existing leasehold homeowners face.\"\nTL;DR: An investigation into the leasehold property market has found \"worrying evidence\" that buyers are being treated unfairly and charged unreasonable fees.\n\nArticle: By M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Dera Ismail Khan\n\nIt was early in 2014 when TV news networks trumpeted a major victory in the war against the Pakistani Taliban - the killing of one of the group's most senior commanders in a night-time air raid. \n\nAdnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border.\n\nRasheed, a former Pakistan Air Force technician, was well-known. He had written an extraordinary letter to Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl and activist shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, attempting to justify why it had happened. He'd also been in prison for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf - until he broke out.\n\nNow it appeared that his luck had run out.\n\nQuoting security officials, news channels reported on 22 January 2014 that Adnan Rasheed's hideout had been targeted two nights earlier in the Hamzoni area.\n\nWaziristan and other parts of the vast mountainous tribal region have been controlled and locked-down by the Pakistani military since the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11, which saw Taliban fighters, al-Qaeda jihadists and other militants flee over the porous border. \n\nOutsiders, including journalists, cannot get in - so verifying claims from the security forces is extremely difficult. Those who have reported stories from Waziristan that don't reflect well on the military have found themselves punished. \n\nIt turned out a year later that the jets had hit the wrong target - Rasheed confirmed this when he emerged in a video to prove he was alive.\n\nInstead of taking out a top militant, Pakistan's military had actually killed the family of a local man who had his home blown to pieces.\n\nThe authorities have never acknowledged they made a mistake. The BBC travelled to Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the banks of the river Indus that is the gateway to the remote and forbidding tribal areas, to meet the man whose house was hit. \n\n\"It must have been 11pm or thereabouts,\"recalls Nazirullah, who was 20 at the time. He and his wife had recently married and had the rare privilege of a room to themselves. The rest of their large family slept in the only other room in their house in Khatei Kalay village.\n\n\"It was as if the house had exploded. My wife and I were shaken out of our sleep. There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the air. Both of us rushed to the door and stepped out, only to discover that the entire roof of our room had already collapsed, except a corner where our bed was.\"\n\nThe roof of the second room had also collapsed, and a fire was raging across the compound. Nazirullah heard cries from the rubble and, with his wife, frantically tried to help those they could see in the glow of the fire.\n\nNeighbours helped them dig out the injured and the dead.\n\nFour of Nazirullah's family died, including a three-year-old girl. His niece Sumayya, whose mother was among those killed, was then just a year old, and survived with a fractured hip. Another four members of the family were rescued from the rubble. All suffered fractures and other injuries.\n\nNazirullah's family has since moved back to Dera Ismail Khan, where life is more peaceful. \n\nLike many others in this part of Pakistan, they have had to move several times to escape an insurgency that has been raging in the tribal areas for nearly two decades.\n\nAccording to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas. \n\nThere are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000. \n\nLocal rights activists say scores of civilians have been killed in successive air campaigns and ground operations by the military. They have been collecting video and documentary evidence to back up their claims.\n\nThese activists are linked to a prominent new rights campaign called the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM) which emerged early last year and has since been publicising alleged rights abuses in the tribal region that victims had previously been too scared to report. \n\n\"It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,\"said Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the PTM.\n\nBut the group is under pressure. The PTM says 13 of its activists were killed on 26 May when the army opened fire on a large group of protesters in North Waziristan. The army said at least three activists were shot dead after a military checkpoint was attacked. The PTM denies this but two of its leaders, who also serve as MPs, have been arrested.\n\nA number of cases highlighted by the PTM - and which the BBC investigated independently - were shared with a Pakistani military spokesman but he declined to respond, calling such allegations\"highly judgmental\".\n\nThere was no response to BBC requests for comment from the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, even though Mr Khan raised the issue of rights abuses in the tribal areas when he was an opposition politician.      \n\nHow 9/11 put the Taliban into Pakistan \n\nIt all started with the al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in New York and Washington.\n\nWhen the US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, the Taliban forces that had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden melted away without a fight.\n\nPakistan, which was one of only three countries to have recognised the Taliban when they seized power in Kabul in 1996, had an interest in keeping the movement alive as part of its efforts to prevent Indian influence from spreading in Afghanistan.\n\nSo while Pakistan had been dependent on US military aid for decades and the then military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf had joined the US\"war on terror\", it also allowed the Taliban to carve out sanctuaries in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal areas, notably the districts of North and South Waziristan.\n\nBut the Afghan Taliban did not cross the border alone. Militants from a complex array of different groups poured into the tribal region and some were far more hostile to the Pakistani state.\n\nJihadists with global ambitions also began plotting attacks from Waziristan, prompting demands from Washington that Pakistan do more to crush Islamist militancy.\n\nAs violence spread, Pakistan was caught\"between an inclination to fight militant forces and yet having to partner with some to strengthen its future bargaining position\", said Ayesha Siddiqa, a security analyst and author of the book Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy.\n\nIn 2014, Pakistan launched a new operation in North Waziristan that increased pressure on militant groups and their safe havens and was credited with reducing attacks elsewhere in the country.\n\n'The Taliban and the military are doing the same thing'\n\nWhen the Taliban arrived in the tribal areas in 2001, they were given a cautious welcome by the local people. But this quickly turned into disillusionment when they started to take over tribal society by enforcing their strict religious codes. \n\nDuring the first phase of that relationship, local youths joined the militants' ranks in their hundreds, thereby causing tribal rivalries to seep into the militant network. This was reflected in subsequent factional wars.\n\nIn the second stage, the Taliban embarked on a campaign to eliminate officially recognised tribal elders who were a hurdle in the way of the insurgents' drive to subjugate the tribes. At least 1,000 tribal elders have been killed by militants since 2002 and some estimates from non-governmental organisations put the figure at nearly 2,000. \n\nOne such assassination in North Waziristan in July 2007 is emblematic of how militants were able to subjugate the tribes.\n\n\"When they kidnapped and killed my brother, the tribe in our region was still strong, but because the military allowed [the militants] the freedom to move against our people, it broke our back,\"says Mohammad Amin, a Wazir tribesman from Razmak area of North Waziristan.\n\nHis brother's body was found dumped in an abandoned truck the day after he was kidnapped by militants. Mohammad Amin and other tribesmen were able to trace the attackers and confronted them. The ensuing gunfight left Mr Amin's son, Asadullah, a cousin and all four Taliban fighters dead. \n\nThe tribe's subsequent calls on military officials in the garrison town of Razmak to curb Taliban violence were frustrated when militant leaders based in that very town threatened reprisal.\n\nA decade on, Mr Amin is in no doubt that\"despite occasional clashes with each other, the Taliban and the military are doing the same thing\".\n\nPTM activists have also documented several cases in which the security forces appear to have treated the local population brutally.\n\nIn May 2016, for example, an attack on a military post in the Teti Madakhel area of North Waziristan triggered a manhunt by troops who rounded up the entire population of a village.\n\nAn eyewitness who watched the operation from a wheat field nearby and whose brother was among those detained told the BBC that the soldiers beat everyone with batons and threw mud in children's mouths when they cried.\n\nA pregnant woman was one of two people who died during torture, her son said in video testimony. At least one man remains missing. \n\nThe stories of survivors are painful too. I met Satarjan Mahsud in the town of Ramak, 100km (60 miles) further south down the Indus river from Dera Ismail Khan. \n\nWe sat inside a white tent and he told me his story over tea, with two young children at his side\n\nOne evening in April 2015 militants fired at a military post in Shaktoi, South Waziristan. Satarjan says troops responded by capturing suspects from a nearby village and shooting two of them dead.\n\nEarly the next morning, on 21 April, they extended their search across the valley to Satarjan's village where they found weapons stashed on a hill behind his house.\n\n\"The only people present in the house at that time were my brother Idarjan, his wife and two daughters-in-law,\"Satarjan says.\n\nThe soldiers knocked at the door. His brother answered and was immediately overpowered, tied up and blindfolded. The troops asked where other male members of the family were and rounded up Idarjan's four sons from elsewhere in the valley.\n\nWitnesses later told Satarjan that the boys had been beaten, and his eldest nephew, Rezwarjan, received a lethal blow to the head.\n\nAll of them were thrown in the back of a pick-up truck which the soldiers had commandeered, and driven away to the army camp in the area.\n\nThe driver of the truck later told Satarjan that Rezwarjan was\"already half dead and couldn't hold himself in a sitting position, so the soldiers decided not to take him to the camp\".\n\nHe told Satarjan:\"They asked me to stop the truck, shot Rezwarjan in the head and threw his body on the road.\"\n\nSatarjan was working at a factory in Dubai at the time. He heard about what had happened and began the journey home. He took a flight, a bus and then walked for 15 hours to reach the village where Rezwarjan's body was found on 23 April.\n\nLocals there told him they hadn't been able to take the body across the valley to his family home because of a curfew, so they had buried it there on the hill.\n\nHe then walked across to his own village where he found his house deserted. The wives of Satarjan's brother and nephews had been taken in by relatives.\n\nSatarjan knew the women wouldn't know the whole story because the curfew forbade travel between villages and there was no mobile network in the area.\n\nWhen he met his sister-in-law, she told him what she knew: that her husband had been taken away by the army and that the younger men were missing.\n\n\"I was in two minds about whether to tell her. But then I thought it would be easier to give her the bad news about Rezwarjan once my brother and the boys had returned. I knew the army had nothing against them and would let them go soon.\"\n\nSo he made up a story, telling her that when the army raided their house, the boys got away to safety in Karachi, far away in southern Pakistan. He assured her that her husband would soon be released.\n\nOn 26 April 2015, he moved the family to Ramak. Since then he's had no word from the military on the fate of his brother and three nephews. Weeks have turned into months, and months into years.\n\nHe is not alone. Local activists say more than 8,000 people picked up by the army since 2002 remain unaccounted for.\n\nMeanwhile, Satarjan has been dodging questions from the women about why they can't visit their village.\n\n\"I tell them our house in Shaktoi has been demolished by the army, which is partly true. But the real reason is that if they go there, neighbours will come for condolences and they will find out.\"\n\nHe says it would be better if he knew his brother and nephews had been jailed, or even killed. But not knowing anything is agony.\n\n\"I can't tell my sister-in-law her sons are missing, or dead. I can't tell the two young wives that they have been widowed,\"he says.\n\nMore from Ilyas in Pakistan\n\nThese individual stories are shocking but they are not unique. The PTM alleges that hundreds of people from the tribal areas could tell similar stories. \n\nBut they remain officially unacknowledged.\n\nThey are the consequences of a war Pakistan has gone to great lengths to hide from the world. This conflict on the Afghan border has for years been an information black hole.\n\nAnd when the PTM broke through this chokehold last year, its media coverage was put under a comprehensive ban. Those in the media who have not heeded the ban have faced physical threats and financial pressure.\n\nThe military has openly called the PTM's patriotic credentials into question, accusing it of links to\"hostile\"intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and India. \n\nAnd some PTM activists who were documenting cases of abuse and running the group's social media campaign have been jailed.\n\nThe treatment of the activists who are finally, after years of silence, raising the alarm on the abuses of a long and secret war suggests that those who have suffered in the conflict face an uphill battle for justice.\nTL;DR: Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Pakistan's long battle with militants as part of the post-9/11 \"war on terror\". Evidence of murder and torture by soldiers and insurgents is emerging only now. The BBC has gained rare access to some of the victims.\n\nArticle: The 29-year-old was passing Starbucks coffee shop in Dudley Street, Wolverhampton, at about 11:45 GMT when wooden debris from a nearby building hit her, police said.\n\nShe suffered\"very serious head injuries\"and died at the scene.\n\nA number of people were also injured as winds of up to 94mph were recorded across the UK.\n\nAt 22:00, UK Power Networks said 35,295 homes remained without power across East Anglia, including 18,720 in Norfolk and 10,180 in Suffolk.\n\nLatest on Storm Doris in Birmingham and the Black Country\n\nThe area outside the coffee branch was sealed off by police after the woman was fatally hit.\n\nA spokesman for Starbucks said:\"We are shocked and saddened by this terrible incident.  \n\n\"We are supporting the police with their investigation and our store will remain closed until further notice.\"\n\nAmbulance crews received about 15 emergency calls at about 11:45 following the incident.\n\nRebecca Davis, a 40-year-old teacher from Wolverhampton, said the woman was hit with debris resembling a piece of roof which was\"about the size of a coffee table\".\n\n\"I think the wind broke it and caused it to fall,\"she said.\n\n\"I don't know if it was hit by something else or just the wind did it.\"\n\nFire services across the country took thousands of weather-related calls as trees came down on to houses, cars, roads and railway lines.\n\nAmbulance crews treated several injured people.\n\nA woman in her 60s was seriously injured when she was hit by a car-port roof in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nIn London, a man was found with suspected head injuries in Victoria Street after police were alerted to reports of\"debris falling from the roof of a building\".\n\nIn Merseyside, a man in his 60s suffered back and pelvic injuries when a tree fell in Crosby, North West Ambulance Service said.\n\nTrain services were also affected, with Virgin Trains suspending all services until 17:00 when a\"very reduced service\"ran to the end of the day.\n\nIn Hertfordshire, a trackside fire was started by a tree falling on to an overhead cable on the railway line at Ware.\n\nAbelio Greater Anglia said it blocked\"all lines\", delaying services.\n\nWest Midlands Police urged people to to take care after it revealed it had received 3,500 calls by 15:00 on Thursday.\n\nSevere weather warnings are in place for some areas of northern England, East Anglia, north Wales and the Midlands, although calmer conditions are expected later.\n\nStorm Doris chaos across England:\nTL;DR: A woman has died after being hit by \"coffee table-sized\" debris in Storm Doris.\n\nArticle: By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter\n\nTesco said its 5% reduction on the cost of women's sanitary products would cover the VAT levied on these items.\n\nLabour MP Paula Sherriff, who has led the campaign for VAT to be cut to zero, said she hoped other retailers would follow suit.\n\nMost have promised to apply a price cut when VAT is reduced.\n\nThe minimum VAT rate is set at EU level. The European Commission is aiming to bring in a zero rate for sanitary products in 2018.\n\nTesco is the first retailer to announce that it will cut its own prices before the headline tax rate has changed.\n\nMichelle McEttrick, Tesco's brand director, said:\"For many of our customers, tampons, panty liners and sanitary towels are essential products.\n\n\"However, the cost of buying them every month can add up, and for many women and girls it can be a real struggle on top of other essential items.\"\n\nOther major supermarkets and pharmacies have agreed in writing to reduce the cost of sanitary products when the VAT charge is reduced, following fears of a repeat of the situation in France where prices failed to fall following a VAT cut. Ms Sherriff said they could now follow Tesco's lead.\n\n\"It would have been completely unacceptable if abolishing the tampon tax had just led to big businesses boosting their bottom line at the expense of women buying what are essential goods, which is why we pushed the supermarkets to sign up to a deal to pass the cut on,\"she said. \n\n\"But this goes a step even further, by reducing prices right now - and I hope the other big retailers now consider doing the same. \n\n\"With retailers coming on board, the UK government and European leaders should set a clear timetable for the tampon tax to be abolished.\"\n\nAt present, the government spends the proceeds from the tax on sanitary products on women's charities after hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition calling for the products to be exempted from tax altogether.\n\nThe government said the latest \u00a312m of funding announced in March benefitted 70 UK charities.\n\nHowever, MPs and campaign groups criticised the \u00a3250,000 grant awarded to anti-abortion group Life - one of the largest amounts from the government fund. Life said the money supported a project for homeless pregnant women in London. \n\nAn HMT spokesperson said:\"We strongly support cutting VAT to zero on tampons and that's why the Finance Act 2016 included legislation to make this happen - however we cannot do this under current EU law.\n\n\"In the meantime, we're awarding \u00a315m a year to women's charities - equivalent to the amount of VAT raised from the sale of women's sanitary products\".\nTL;DR: Women should be told now when the tampon tax will be abolished, an MP has said, as the UK's largest supermarket announced a price cut for the products.\n\nArticle: The images by amateur photographer Phyllis Nicklin were found last year when University of Birmingham staff were clearing out a building.\n\nMs Nicklin, a lecturer from Aston, took the photos between 1953 and 1969.\n\nA selection are on display at the city's Reuben Colley gallery and artists have been invited to interpret the photos.\n\nDavid Oram, from the university, published Ms Nicklin's photos on his local history website, Brumpic.\n\nHe said:\"She's captured a time of change in Birmingham where new buildings [were] going up, the [old ones] coming down.

Rain fell on 23 out of 31 days in January across the UK.\nTL;DR: Residents of the flood-hit Somerset Levels have accused Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith of \"letting everyone down\", as he visited the area.\n\nArticle: By Christopher SleightBBC Scotland news\n\nFour years ago, there were just 3,500 electric vehicles in the UK. As of August 2017, there are almost 113,000.\n\nBut many in the industry believe the market will soon see even bigger growth. It's not just Scotland - most European countries have targets for phasing out combustion engine vehicles.\n\n\"It's expected that the big rush to buy electric vehicles (EV) will be this year or next year,\"says Paul Minto.\n\nHe's a partner in the energy and utilities team for global law firm Addleshaw Goddard, and an industry expert.\n\n\"Motor Trade Association figures show sales are now booming. They're on the upward curve.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem that long ago that electric vehicles were mainly for a select band of car buyers who were either very wealthy or who only made very short journeys.\n\nThe advance of technology - in particular battery technology - is changing this rapidly. As the prices comes down and range goes up more people are buying EVs.\n\nBut Mr Minto says that there needs to be a corresponding focus on the infrastructure needed to keep all these batteries topped up, to keep EV owners from suffering the dreaded\"range anxiety\"- the fear your car will slow to a peaceful stop before it reaches its destination.\n\nThe starting point is to install trickle charging points in people's homes.\n\nThis is easy if you have your own drive, but - as Ms Sturgeon has acknowledged - many people in Scotland live in tenements.\n\nSo how do you ensure that several hundred people living in a block of flats can all charge their cars up overnight?\n\nAnd how does the National Grid cope with the inevitable strain as everyone plugs their car in every evening?\n\nThese two problems are the\"missing pieces in the jigsaw\", according to Mr Minto. They're also where the big\"commercial opportunity\"is. There's lots of money to be made for those who can find the answers.\n\nOne of the ways mass-charging points can be created in densely-populated urban areas is with massive batteries kept in shipping container-style boxes.\n\n\"You can locate big batteries anywhere you want and attach EV charging points to those,\"says Mr Minto.\n\n\"Those batteries can be charged at any time of day or night so you do it when it's cheapest. Or you can use a renewable energy source like wind or hydropower to charge them.\"\n\nThese big batteries have two advantages - they're an efficient way of providing a lot of charging points in a small area and they\"smooth out\"the demand for electricity at certain times.\n\nMr Minto says these big batteries could easily be installed in the corner of an office car park and could have 50 charging points attached.\n\nThe batteries already exist, but there's a\"vast\"technology race under way to make them cheaper, smaller and faster-charging, he says.\n\nAnd in urban areas we should be prepared to see parking meter-style charge points popping up on many roads - potentially providing a plug-in facility for every parking space on a busy street.\n\nOther possibilities for charging lots of cars in a small space include more futuristic designs - like towers which stack cars up while charging them.\n\nIt's this type of solution that the Scottish government needs to embrace if mass electric car ownership is to become a reality. It's also one of the reasons Ms Sturgeon announced a \u00a360m innovation fund alongside the 2032 target.\n\nBut Scotland has another big challenge to overcome with electric cars.\n\nAlthough there are densely-populated cities, the vast majority of the country is rural, with big distances between villages or small towns.\n\nIt's enough to make a range-anxious electric car owner go weak at the knees. Or is it?\n\nEs Tresidder lives just outside Fort William, where he runs his own business designing low-energy buildings.\n\nUntil last year, he was living in Brussels where he and his family didn't need a car to get around - but he realised that would change once he moved to Scotland.\n\nBeing immersed in the green economy and low-energy design, he was keen to try an electric car, but wasn't sure if it was the best option in a rural area.\n\n\"I initially thought there was no way it would work. Looking at web forums for electric car owners, I was told by many people it wouldn't work as my only vehicle in somewhere like the Highlands.\n\n\"But then I looked into it a bit more and decided it was worth a gamble.\"\n\n'More convenient'\n\nHe bought a second generation Nissan Leaf, one of the most popular models of electric car in the UK.\n\nMr Tresidder acknowledges there's a perception EVs are only good for small journeys in big cities - but says his experience has been\"surprisingly good\"so far.\n\n\"For most of my usage I won't use the public chargers at all - I just use the one at our house.\n\n\"If you've got somewhere to charge at home or work, that's all you will need for most of your charging,\"he says.\n\nHome chargers like Mr Tresidder's are generally slower, but are fine for overnight charging.\n\n\"It's actually more convenient than a petrol or diesel car because I never have to go to a petrol station.\n\n\"There's also very low maintenance. All I've done on my car in the last 12 months is topped up the windscreen fluid and put some winter tyres on.\"\n\nBroken charger\n\nThe range on Mr Tresidder's Nissan is about 120 miles (193km) - though it varies with the temperature and the speed he drives - which is more than enough for everyday use, he says.\n\n\"When I do go on longer journeys, the average speed in the Highlands means I'm driving long enough that I'm ready for a half-hour break - especially with three children.\"\n\nThe rapid charging technology found at most public charge points will bring the Leaf's batteries up to 80% in about 30 minutes.\n\nMr Tresidder says he's not yet needed to queue to plug his car in and has only found one charger that didn't work.\n\nThat was in Mallaig, where someone let him plug in to their wall socket with a standard three-pin extension lead for a couple of hours, which gave him enough charge to get home.\n\nBut he admits there are occasions when owning an electric car feels a lot more inconvenient than driving a petrol or diesel model.\n\n\"My parents live in Derbyshire and to go to see them I think I have to stop five times [to charge] - that's considerably less convenient.\n\n\"But then I only do that journey a couple of times a year and it's cost me \u00a310 rather than \u00a360 or \u00a370.\"\n\nThere are also apps and websites to show the location of EV charging points - and sometimes even if they're occupied or not - which helps to keep the range anxiety at bay.\n\nThere will clearly need to be a lot more charging points installed around Scotland to keep up with the rise in EV ownership.\n\nOr could part of the change over the next 15 years be a move away from traditional car ownership altogether?\n\nIf fewer people own cars and instead share them, or use public transport, then the pressure on the charging infrastructure is reduced.\n\nMr Minto believes there's likely to be a cultural shift soon.\n\n\"Over the passage of time, the ownership model of cars will become less important. We are may be the last generation to want that,\"he says.\n\n\"Already on the west coast of the USA you see driverless, autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"They're just driverless pods - in effect you're no longer owning a car, you're just sharing time in one.\"\n\nThis might seem impossibly far into the future.\n\n'No sacrifice'\n\nBut Mr Tresidder says he has no doubt that electric vehicles of some kind are in his future. He says he'll never buy another petrol or diesel car again.\n\n\"Driving a petrol or diesel would feel like a step backwards in terms of how nice it is,\"he says.\n\n\"This summer we did a house swap for our holiday which included a car swap.\n\n\"The petrol car we got was noisy and smelly. You had hill starts and the business of balancing the clutch.\n\n\"We stalled it constantly. We spent lots of money at petrol stations. It wasn't that nice at all.\n\n\"People often think of climate change mitigation in terms of sacrifices, but electric cars aren't a sacrifice at all - they're an improvement over what we're used to.\"\nTL;DR: The first minister has set a target for new petrol and diesel vehicles to be phased out in Scotland by 2032. Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement as part of her  programme for government  for 2017-18. More people are buying electric vehicles, but there are significant challenges ahead if we're to be weaned off the combustion engine completely.\n\nArticle: North Norfolk fruit grower Simon Turner said the supply of EU labour had dried up and Covid was still causing issues, while the government's Pick for Britain campaign had also been dropped.\n\n\"We're in a very serious position,\"he said. \n\nThe government said it would continue to help farmers recruit the seasonal workers needed.\n\nMr Turner said he currently had 11 workers but needed 62.\n\n\"We do not know how many workers we will get,\"he said.\n\n\"Before Brexit we were able to employ from Romania and Bulgaria, now we aren't unless they have a right to remain in the UK, therefore that labour source is cut off to us.\"\n\nWith Brexit, the supply of unrestricted migrant labour on farms came to an end and was replaced by the government's Seasonal Workers Pilot. \n\nThe scheme was extended for 2021 to make 30,000 visas available for people who want to come and work on UK farms.\n\nBut the number of visas available does not meet the sector's entire seasonal workforce need.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it still wanted to encourage British workers to pick fruit and vegetables despite scrapping the Pick for Britain scheme.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the vice president of the National Farmers' Union, said it was hoped there would be enough workers through a combination of those from the UK and overseas.\n\nHe said Pick for Britain was born in a\"period of crisis\"last year but\"what we need this year is to make sure we've got that continuity of supply\".\n\nHe said if the crops could not be harvested it would put pressure on the supply chain, which could lead to food price inflation or more imports.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

And then Shaikh, happy she had found someone who understood, handed over two pink bags so that her new friend could take them away and fill them with bombs to blow up St Paul's Cathedral. \n\nAs they parted, Azra would probably have stopped the covert recording she had been making. She and other undercover investigators had slowly, patiently, reeled in Shaikh - saving London from an appalling attack.\n\nShaikh was born Michelle Ramsden in 1983 and converted to Islam in 2007 after being impressed with the kindness of a neighbouring Muslim family. \n\nHer adoption of the faith came after a deeply troubled upbringing. She'd spent time in care homes and later confided to one undercover officer that her family was riven by drug and alcohol abuse. She too had become an addict. \n\n\"It was the only life I really knew,\"she said.\"Inside my heart always felt empty - I think this [is] why I used drugs to try to fill the emptiness,\"she wrote in one message online. \n\nIn the years that followed her conversion to Islam, the Old Bailey heard she had become increasingly distanced from her own family. She initially found a new family - the small community of female converts in London who supported others on the same faith journey. \n\nBut drugs soon overwhelmed her. In 2013 she was cautioned for theft and given a community order for burglary. Two years later she was arrested for heroin possession. \n\nRajan Basra has studied Shaikh's online footprint as part of his research at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London. \n\n\"It's clear that she had several underlying vulnerabilities - she created a [YouTube] list specifically about surviving drug addiction,\"he says. \n\n\"Her Facebook content shows that she was very isolated from her family. And like many converts, she found it difficult to make that transition - and so she was reaching out to other people in a similar situation.\"\n\nLooking at the 90 YouTube playlists Shaikh created, a change in her mindset could be seen - particularly around 2016 - said Mr Basra.\n\n\"Throughout this whole period, she was then watching a lot of extremist content - content produced by supporters and activists generally affiliated with the Islamic State,\"he said.\"And judging by the playlist that she created, she was watching this for hours.\"\n\nEvidence from court shows that she was in contact with members of Al Muhajiroun, the British network headed by the jihadist preacher Anjem Choudary. One particular influence on her life was Abu Waleed, whose real name is Shahid Janjua. He sent her extremist material - and when she began to voice these opinions within the convert community, she found herself ostracised.   \n\nBetween August 2016 and September 2017, the national Prevent scheme - in which police, social services and others aim to stop people sliding towards violent extremism - looked three times at Shaikh. \n\nShe denied having extremist views but MI5 ultimately reached a different assessment, based on its own intelligence-gathering. It made her a\"subject of interest\"- one of the 3,000 potential or active terrorists under investigation.  \n\nAnd those concerns were justified. \n\nShaikh had become an administrator of\"GreenB1rds\", a secret jihadist chat channel dedicated to encouraging attacks in the name of the Islamic State group. She posed as a man, using the nom-de-guerre Al Amriki,\"the American\", to maximise her chances of encouraging others to join up.  \n\nWhen one Dutch follower was arrested last summer, Shaikh posted a picture threatening an attack against a church in the city of Hilversum, near Amsterdam. \n\nThe picture was shared on mainstream social media - and then made it into Dutch newspapers, causing alarm in the city. \n\nIn turn, there was a bomb hoax against the church - causing a major alert. \n\nShaikh joked online:\"Kuffar [disbelievers] always publish my work they don't even realise they promote for us.\"\n\nAnother of her online contacts was a Dutch woman, Yousra Lemouesset. \n\nShe had previously been banned from the UK - and had joined her British fighter husband in Syria. His fate is unclear but she returned to Europe and since Shaikh's arrest, she's been jailed in The Netherlands for assisting the IS group.  \n\nOn 18 August last year, Shaikh went to Luton Airport to fly to Amsterdam to meet Lemousset. But she was stopped from flying by counter-terrorism officers who questioned her about her plans.\n\nFurious, she returned home and, with her helpers, created an image of the New York skyline. In lettering mimicking blood, she added:\"PIGS YOU WILL SOON PAY FOR YOUR CRIMES\".\n\nAnd two days later, she thought she had finally met someone who could help.  \n\nShe began talking online to someone she called\"H\". He appeared to be an IS attack planner in the UK but\"H\"did not exist - he was a fake identity, operated by an undercover team, tracking extremists on social media. \n\nThese\"Online Role Players\"are now key in the fight against potential lone attackers - seeking to infiltrate hidden chat groups and identifying the most dangerous suspects. \n\n\"I rather die young and get Jannah [heaven], quickest way possible,\"she told\"H\". \n\nThe officer asked what she wanted. \n\nAfter a few days of thought, she replied:\"So this is really what I want... I would like to kill a lot brother. Until I'm killed.\"\n\n\"I would like do church... But want to do a place that also means something to kuffar. Like history. They will care more about the building than people killed... U know where they do the royal weddings? Is it possible to put, like, bomb with detonator and then keep shooting until I am killed?\"\n\nShe meant St Paul's Cathedral. \n\n\"Have you thought how you would do it?\"H asked her. \n\n\"No brother, I don't know.. I just want to do the most effective way possible. I don't know a lot about them things,\"she replied. \n\n\"But you must have an idea sis, so I can help?\"he said.\n\nShaikh's plan evolved in the following days to one involving a bomb for the landmark, another for herself and possibly another for a nearby hotel.\n\n\"I just want a lot to die... I had all the intentions to do this, but no other support,\"she told him. \n\nOn 7 September, she posted a document to her chat group on how to carry out surveillance of a target. The next morning, she visited the cathedral, carrying a pink bag that she thought would be right for a bomb and later reported back. \n\n\"I really thought it would not be possible. But it's easy,\"she wrote. \n\n\"So would you want it in the bag or strapped to you like vest? Or no vest?\"asked\"H\".  \n\n\"I think bag better,\"said Shaikh.\"What u think? Or both? Won't it be a bigger explosion, if both? Sorry, I expect a lot - lol.\"\n\n\"I agree but it's your niyyah [intention]. I need to know so I can prepare.\"\n\n\"Is that OK then.. Both... U will teach me everything to do?\"\n\n\"H\"told Shaikh that she would now need to meet his\"wife\", Azra, for the handover of the bags - and to measure her up for a body-worn suicide bomb.\n\nShaikh agreed a time and place and replied:\"Am so happy to have family.\"\n\nThe women met on 22 September in west London. Azra was recording everything Shaikh said.\n\n\"I had the really horrible path [sic],\"said Shaikh.\"I want forgiveness for everything in my life that I've done.\"\n\nShe began to cry. \n\n\"I'm scared of not going to Jannah [heaven]...  I've had enough of this place... I want to give something back.\"\n\nThe pair, fully veiled to hide their identities, walked back to the Tube station. And there, Shaikh handed over the two bags for bombs.  \n\nDays later, she was arrested. \n\nShaikh pleaded guilty in February to preparing the attack. But Benjamin Newton, defending, argued at the Old Bailey that all was not what it seemed. \n\nThe first day of the police interviews had to be abandoned, he said, because Shaikh was in a state of heroin withdrawal. \n\n\"The terrorism attack that she is guilty of preparing would have been a truly dreadful act, if carried out, and she recognises that,\"said Mr Newton.   \n\n\"The key words are'if carried out'. Three people were involved in this plot, and two others were police officers. There was no bomb, there never would be. There were only police officers pretending to care about her, offering her words of encouragement to see how far she would go.\"\n\nMr Newton said Shaikh had\"cold feet\". She had cancelled a second meeting with the\"wife\"and had asked to put back the attack from Christmas to Easter.\n\n\"It is quite clear that her involvement in the organisation that she became involved in were all part of a craving to be part of a family that she never had.\n\n\"She was desperate for those she engaged with to like and accept her,\"said Mr Newton.\n\nAlison Morgan QC, prosecuting, put it another way to the court.  \n\n\"Had the role player not sat in this position, she would have found an equivalent.\"\n\nAnd in a final twist to her tale - that's exactly what Safiyya Shaikh then confirmed herself. Hours after her defence mitigation finished in court, she made a call from prison, that was recorded as standard. A call she knew the authorities would have been listening to. \n\n\"I'm so tired about things,\"she said to her confidante.\"I didn't get cold feet yeah... I was ready to go through with it... I wasn't having doubts.\"\n\nUnder the law, the officers did nothing wrong in playing a role that allowed them to gather critical evidence about Shaikh's intentions and preparations. There is no defence in the British courts of\"entrapment\"- and the transcripts in the case show the officers asking questions, rather than proposing specific targets. \n\nRajan Basra at King's College London says her case shows how difficult it is to work out how to intervene successfully in the life of a potential terrorist before they go too far. \n\n\"Radicalisation is not always a straight line,\"he says.\"She could have waxed and waned in her support for the cause. And so the key thing with prevention services is you have to get there at the right time.\n\n\"And then that support has to be consistent - and it has to have that long-term payoff. It's really difficult to say what more that service could have done.\"\nTL;DR: A supporter of the banned Islamic State terror group has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years after admitting a plot to blow herself up in a bomb attack on St Paul's Cathedral in London. \n\nMuslim convert Safiyya Shaikh was caught after an elaborate operation - but her case raised doubts in court about whether the drug-addicted and emotionally damaged woman would ever have gone through with the attack.\n\nArticle: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Bill Birtles and the Australian Financial Review's Mike Smith landed in Sydney on Tuesday.\n\nChinese authorities questioned both men before their departure. The ABC reported Birtles was\"not asked about his reporting or conduct in China\".\n\nRelations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years.\n\nThere had been allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society in the past, but ties worsened after Canberra backed an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Monday a record 17 foreign journalists were expelled from the country in the first half of 2020.\n\nAustralian foreign minister Marise Payne said consular officials had assisted the pair in returning home.\n\n\"I also want to note that Australia is of course a strong supporter of media freedom, freedom of the press, and that it is disappointing that after many years, Australia will not have a media organisation present in China for some period of time,\"she added in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that Chinese authorities had questioned the journalists about Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist for Chinese state media who has been detained since last month.\n\nIn their first comments on the detention, the Chinese foreign ministry said she was being held on\"national security grounds\". \n\nWhat happened to the pair? \n\nMr Birtles told the BBC that Australian diplomats advised him last Monday that he should leave China immediately.\n\n\"They'd received some sort of warning or advice, they never specified what,\"said the journalist. \n\nHe was then booked on a flight due to leave Beijing last Thursday. But the situation escalated on Wednesday at midnight when six Chinese police officers and a translator visited his apartment as he held farewell drinks with friends.\n\nHe said the police did not detain him, but informed him that he was involved in a\"national security investigation,\"and that he could not leave the country.\n\nThey said they would call him the following afternoon to talk about the investigation. \n\nHe contacted Australian consular officials the next morning, who collected him and took him to the Australian embassy, where he spent the next four days.\n\n\"There obviously is not a great deal of trust with China at the moment about how safe I would have been if initially, by myself, I went and did that meeting,\"said Mr Birtles.\n\nHe was later interviewed by Chinese police in the presence of Australia's ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher.\n\nMr Birtles said he was questioned about Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist who worked for state broadcaster CGTN. She was detained in China last month on suspicion of\"criminal activity endangering China's national security\".\n\n\"I know her, but not particularly well, it didn't seem like I would be the most logical person to interrogate if you wanted evidence about her case,\"he said.\n\nMr Birtles said he was also asked about sources he used to report Hong Kong's national security law, and on Australia's relations with China.\n\n\"There wasn't any real rigorous effort to extract any evidence or anything that could really be used in any case,\"he added.\n\nMr Smith, who is based in Shanghai, also received a visit by police - prompting him to go to the Australian consulate there. He, too, was questioned over Ms Cheng, the AFR reported. \n\nThe pair were both allowed to leave the country after their interviews by police.\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\n\"It's very disappointing to have to leave under those circumstances,\"Mr Birtles said in Sydney. \n\n\"It's a relief to be back in the country with genuine rule of law. But this was a whirlwind and it's not a particularly good experience.\"\n\nThe AFR's editors, Michael Stutchbury and Paul Bailey, said they were glad both journalists were safe.\n\n\"This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing and is not in the interests of a co-operative relationship between Australia and China,\"they said in a joint statement.\n\nBy anyone's standards, what happened with these two journalists is a worrying development.\n\nBill Birtles and Mike Smith were the last correspondents for Australian media working in China. Their evacuation means for the first time since the mid-1970s, there are no accredited Australian journalists in the country. \n\nChina is not only Australia's key trading partner and the biggest customer for its coal and iron ore, but it's also one of its most important stories to cover. As tensions rise between Beijing and Canberra, the need for journalists on the ground in China becomes ever more crucial. \n\nThe ABC's news director, Gaven Morris, said:\"The story of China, its relationship with Australia and its role in our region and in the world is one of great importance for all Australians and we want to continue having our people on the ground to cover it.\"\n\nBut as both countries continue to exchange political and diplomatic jabs - and with China's broader crackdown on Western journalists - it's hard to see when Australian reporters will be allowed back. \n\nThis development is not only a critical marker in the relationship between the two countries, it will no doubt affect Australian media coverage of this important story. \n\nWhy are Australia-China ties strained?\n\nThe countries rely heavily on each other for trade, but their relationship has soured in recent years, amid allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society.\n\nTies have deteriorated further this year after Canberra backed an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nIn actions widely viewed as retaliatory, Beijing has since imposed restrictions on Australian exports such as beef, barley and wine. It has also warned Chinese tourists and students about racism in Australia. \n\nIn July, Australia warned its citizens they may face\"arbitrary detention\"in China - a travel warning that remains in place.\n\nCanberra has also expressed concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and urged China to release detained Australians such as Yang Hengjun, a democracy activist who has been held for 19 months without trial.\n\nThe case of Ms Lei - made public last week - has been shrouded in secrecy. \n\nThe Melbourne-raised presenter for Chinese state broadcaster CGTN is being held in a secret location for unknown reasons, according to Australian officials.\nTL;DR: The last two reporters working in China for Australian media have flown home after a five-day diplomatic standoff.\n\nArticle: Bob Higgins sexually touched and groped 24 victims, most of them trainees at Southampton FC and Peterborough United.\n\nIn May, Higgins, 66, was found guilty at a retrial of 45 counts of indecent assault between 1971 and 1996. He was convicted of another count last year.\n\nJudge Peter Crabtree called Higgins a\"predatory, cunning\"serial sex abuser who\"carefully groomed\"the teenagers.\n\nHiggins' victims told Winchester Crown Court of suicidal thoughts and relationship problems later in life.\n\nAn emotional statement, read by Dean Radford on behalf of the victims on the steps of the court, said Higgins'\"arrogance was his downfall\".\n\n\"You can call us brave, you can call us courageous - we were not - we were the unlucky ones for falling into the entrapment of Higgins' manipulative, deceitful and sexual behaviour,\"it said.\n\nDuring Higgins' trial, prosecutors told the court he was\"idolised\"by trainees, who viewed him as a mentor and father figure.\n\nVictims said they were abused during post-exercise soapy massages, in Higgins' car while he played love songs on the stereo and at his home where he cuddled with boys on his sofa.\n\n'Severe psychological harm'\n\nJudge Crabtree said Higgins had shown\"not one jot of remorse\".\n\n\"They believed you held the key to their futures,\"he told the defendant.\n\n\"You normalised cuddling and stroking, which paved the way for more intimate abuse.\n\n\"For many the impact extended to their performance on the field or to turning their backs on a football career. Some of them suffered severe psychological harm.\"\n\nHiggins made no reaction as the sentence was passed.\n\nThe allegations arose after the NSPCC set up a dedicated helpline for people who had encountered childhood abuse within football.\n\nIt was launched after a number of former footballers, including Billy Seymour, spoke on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in November 2016. \n\nHiggins stood trial last year, but a retrial was ordered after jurors failed to reach verdicts on 48 counts of indecent assault. \n\nMr Seymour, a Southampton youth player who went on to play for Coventry City and Millwall, had waived his right to anonymity to speak publicly.\n\nHe gave evidence at last year's trial but was killed in a car crash in January before Higgins' retrial. \n\nOn Tuesday, his mother Jean read his victim impact statement, written before his death, to the court.\n\nAddressed to Higgins, it said:\"I am sick to my stomach of giving you any more thought. I have been a broken man. You have debilitated my whole life.\n\n\"The mist is clearing. I can see some light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"I will beat the hating of you in my soul. This is closure. Goodbye, Bob Higgins.\"\n\nMr Radford had given evidence as a character witness because Higgins was found not guilty of abusing him at a separate trial in the early 1990s.\n\nReading the victims' statement, he said:\"There were so many warning signs out there but no-one would listen - that let this monster walk free and carry on abusing.\n\n\"We believe that many people must have known what was going on, the truth will come out in the end.\n\n\"Today is not just about us complainants and witnesses who have suffered through this nightmare, it's the wives, girlfriends, sons and daughters who have suffered with us.\"\n\nHe also paid tribute to their\"dear friend\"Billy Seymour.\n\n\"We did it Billy - just like you said we would, you can now rest in peace.\"\n\n'Further allegations'\n\nDet Ch Insp David Brown, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the conviction was\"testament to the bravery of those who came forward to give evidence\".\n\n\"There can be no understanding of the damage that individual has caused to the lives of the people who stood with us through the criminal trial\".\n\nHe said the force was\"assessing a number of reports\"of further allegations against Higgins. \n\nSouthampton FC offered an\"unreserved apology\"to his victims last week.\n\nIn a statement, the club said it recognised boys under its care\"suffered exposure to abuse when they should have received protection from any form of harm\".\n\n'Keep quiet or risk losing everything'\n\nDuring his time as a coach, Bob Higgins worked with young footballers who would go on to become national heroes and household names.\n\nBut others were not so fortunate. \n\nSome were haunted by their ordeals, and gave up on football entirely.\n\nSuch was Higgins's hold over those he abused, many felt unable to say anything, even to close family members, for up to 30 years.\n\nRead more: The'star-maker' who abused young footballers\n\nA BBC South Today documentary about the Higgins case, A Saint and a Sinner, is available on BBC iPlayer\nTL;DR: A former youth football coach has been jailed for 24 years and three months for abusing young players.\n\nArticle: The allegations are based on leaked messages between Jamie Bryson, Sinn F\u00e9in's Daith\u00ed McKay and another Twitter user, also believed to be in Sinn F\u00e9in. \n\nThe messages were exchanged before Mr Bryson appeared at Stormont's National Management Agency (Nama) inquiry.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in has denied knowledge of the communications.\n\n'Wholly inappropriate'\n\nThe Stormont Finance Committee inquiry, chaired then by Mr McKay, was set up last year due to political controversy over the multi-million pound sale of Nama's Northern Ireland property portfolio.\n\nIt followed an allegation made in the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) that a politician or political party in Northern Ireland stood to profit from the loan sale.\n\nLast September, Mr Bryson used a meeting of the Stormont Finance Committee to name former DUP leader Peter Robinson as the individual he referred to as\"Person A\"in relation to the scandal. \n\nThe then first minister of Northern Ireland strongly denied he had sought to benefit in any way from the multi-million pound property deal. \n\nIt is now claimed that Mr McKay and another Sinn F\u00e9in member advised Mr Bryson about his evidence before the hearing. \n\nThe leaked social media messages were obtained by the Irish News and the BBC's Nolan Show.\n\n'Great finisher'\n\nThey show that on 17 September 2015, Mr McKay sent a direct message to Mr Bryson, telling him to follow a Twitter account in the name of Thomas O'Hara, who is understood to be a fellow Sinn F\u00e9in member.\n\nThe following day, a direct Twitter message from Mr O'Hara to Mr Bryson said:\"You may only get 10-15 seconds on this before Daithi as chair has to pull you on it so squeeze your best points on this into 1-2 lines and come straight to the point.\"\n\nAnother message from him said:\"Keep it short if you can, when it's said it's said and its privileged.

The company is nothing if not ambitious - and it has certainly made an impact in Europe's cut-throat aviation market. But it needs to become consistently profitable, before the money runs out. \n\nNorwegian's chief executive, Bjorn Kjos, has overseen a major expansion of the airline over the past five years, doubling the size of its fleet and expanding its route network dramatically. But his biggest gambit has been a major play into the low-cost long-haul market.\n\nCheap transatlantic travel is not a new idea: Freddie Laker tried it in the 1970s. \n\nBut it was only with the development of highly fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - which Norwegian is using - and the Airbus A350 that the idea really took off. \n\nNow others are following Norwegian's example.\n\nBut all of this has come at a price. Norwegian has debts of $3.5bn and expects to rack up a sizeable loss for 2018. \n\nProblems with engines on its shiny new Dreamliners clearly haven't helped either.\n\nSmall wonder Mr Kjos now says the carrier will focus on cost-cutting and profitability, rather than growth. His airline has shaken up the market - now it needs to show it can consistently make money from it as well.\n\nLast year, Norwegian Air launched the first-ever budget flight from London to South America\n\nFares on the 14-hour trip to Buenos Aires started from \u00a3259 one-way.\n\nThe company started as a small regional airline flying between Bergen and Trondheim in 1993.\n\nMr Kjos turned it into Scandinavia's largest airline and the third-biggest budget carrier in Europe.\n\nNorwegian's price strategy has been based on flying a young fleet of aircraft such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which burn less fuel per passenger compared with other long-haul aircraft.\n\nThese offer passengers a more upmarket experience than they may have come to expect from a budget airline, with modern interiors and the benefit of free wi-fi on all routes in the future.\n\nIt flies from Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh airports to more than 150 destinations across Europe and worldwide including Boston, Dubai and San Francisco.\n\nBut in the second quarter of last year, the Civil Aviation Authority's most recent data, Norwegian was the airline with the second highest number of complaints from UK passengers, of those still in business.\n\nIt received 526 complaints per million travellers carried in that three-month period to June 2018, behind Tui Airways with 663, but ahead of TAP Portugal, with 430, and Ryanair, with 319.\n\nSmall Planet Airlines, which had its licence suspended by the CAA in November after filing for insolvency the previous month, had received 27,998 complaints per million customers in the same period.\n\nBudget airlines have had differing fortunes in recent months.\n\nIn November, EasyJet announced a 41% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a3578m for the year to 30 September.\n\nAnd earlier this month, it said that it expected its full-year profits to meet City forecasts.\n\nHowever, Ryanair cut its profit forecast, blaming lower-than-expected air fares.\nTL;DR: Norwegian Air wants to raise 3bn Norwegian kroner (\u00a3268m) through a rights issue to improve its finances.\n\nArticle: Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said the ban reflected a\"commitment to animal welfare\". \n\n\"The use of wild animals for entertainment purposes in circuses can no longer be permitted,\"he said. \n\n\"This is the general view of the public at large and a position I am happy to endorse.\"\n\nA statement from his department said the minister acknowledged that circus owners and operators may have\"regrets\"about the ban.\n\nBut it added that the ability of a travelling circus to\"provide fully for all the needs of animals such as camels or tigers is no longer a tenable proposition\".\n\n'Outdated and abnormal'\n\nThe ban has been welcomed by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA), which had collected more than 27,600 signatures in support for a change in the law.\n\n\"Travelling circuses cannot  and will never be able provide a suitable environment for wild animals such as elephants, tigers and lions which have complex physical and psychological welfare needs,\"said the ISPCA's chief executive, Dr Andrew Kelly.\n\n\"Coercing wild animals into doing tricks, which are actually abnormal behaviours for these animals, for human entertainment is outdated and it is right that it is being consigned to the history books where it belongs.\"\n\nZoo concerns\n\nThe Scottish government is in the process of introducing similar legislation, which if passed, will be the first of its kind in the UK.\n\nThe Association of Circus Proprietors warned MSPs that the proposed law could\"eventually close your zoos\".\n\nHowever, the Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses (Scotland) Bill passed its first stage through parliament last month.\n\nIn 2014, Northern Ireland's then Agriculture Minister, Sinn F\u00e9in Michelle O'Neill, told the Stormont Assembly that there were no circuses based north of the Irish border, but there were some that travelled from\"the 26 counties\".\n\n\"It is important that we work together to agree a protocol, and have a clear protocol in place,\"Mrs O'Neill said at the time. \n\nOn Thursday, the Irish minister said he was allowing\"a modest lead in period\"to allow circus staff for make alternative arrangements for their existing wild animals. \n\n\"While the retirement of the small numbers of wild animals in Irish circuses might seem like a loss. I am confident that this move will do more to secure the future of the circus community.  \n\n\"Coming in line with modern welfare standards will mean that greater numbers of the public will be more comfortable with going to the circus.\"\n\nThe regulation was signed by Mr Creed on Thursday, under the provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.\n\nThe 2013 act was a major piece of legislation that replaced laws spanning more then a century, including the pre-partition 1911 Protection of Animals Act.\nTL;DR: The Irish government is to ban the use of wild animals in circuses from next year, with a new regulation that will come into effect on 1 January 2018.\n\nArticle: Mark Drakeford's political awakening came early.\n\nNationalist fervour swept his home town of Carmarthen when Gwynfor Evans was elected as Plaid Cymru's first MP in 1966.\n\nAt grammar school, Mr Drakeford remembers groups of pupils marching around chanting political slogans. \n\nEnglish-only road signs lay piled on the ground, torn down the night before.\n\nThe political climate fired the imagination of the young Drakeford, a clarinet-playing cricket fan. Trashing road signs was, he thought, a\"fantastic thing to be doing\", he told me.\n\nBut the teenager thought class was more important than nationality, so he became a socialist and joined the Labour Party.\n\nIn the final year of his Latin degree at the University of Kent in Canterbury, he answered an advert in the Guardian to become a probation officer.\n\nArriving for work in Cardiff in 1979, he found the offenders in Ely living in substandard council houses.\n\nBut there wasn't much a probation officer could do about that.\n\nSo he stood for and was elected to South Glamorgan council in 1985.\n\nBack then, Cardiff's highly factional Labour Party was a\"viper's nest\", says one of his contemporaries. \n\nIn the late 80s, the council was led by Jack Brooks, for years the right-hand man of former Prime Minister Jim Callaghan.\n\n\"Jack was very much in control, very much the baron, the person in charge,\"says Labour AM Julie Morgan, a long-time friend and ally of Mr Drakeford.\n\nLord Brooks threw his weight behind one of the signal projects of the day - the Cardiff Bay Barrage. \n\nSome were deeply opposed, including Mrs Morgan's late husband Rhodri, the former Cardiff West MP and future first minister.\n\nMark Drakeford was an opponent too, believing it would cause flooding in his Pontcanna ward. \n\nTogether with another future AM - Jane Hutt, then the councillor for Riverside - he was suspended from South Glamorgan council's Labour group for voting against it.\n\nInstead of civil engineering spectacles, Mr Drakeford preferred the grass-roots approach of setting up charities and community centres.\n\nMr Drakeford was part of a leftish circle of Cardiff politicians who later joined Rhodri Morgan's\"kitchen cabinet\"in the Welsh government of the 2000s. \n\nAmong them were Ms Hutt, Jane Davidson and Sue Essex. All three become assembly members and ministers. \n\n\"These were all political friendships but we had a lot in common as well politically,\"Ms Hutt says.\n\n\"Alliances and friendships go together often.\"\n\nIn 1993 Mr Drakeford stood down from the council.\n\nHe went into academia, teaching at Swansea and later at Cardiff University, where he became a professor of social policy.\n\nOne of his students was future leader of Plaid Cymru Leanne Wood - like him, a probation officer who became an assembly member (AM).\n\nHe got her an extension for her final assignment which was due while she was standing for Plaid Cymru at the 1997 general election.\n\n\"He believed I would learn more running a general election campaign about how to help people than on the course for two months,\"she says.\n\nHis bid to become the AM for Cardiff Central in the first assembly election in 1999 failed.\n\nNevertheless, he came to wield huge influence over devolution - arguably more influence than most AMs.\n\nWhen Alun Michael was ousted as first secretary, Mr Drakeford became a special adviser on health and social care under Rhodri Morgan.\n\nThey already knew each other well through the Cardiff West constituency. Mr Drakeford had been Mr Morgan's election agent.\n\nJane Hutt, Mr Morgan's health minister, says it was a\"huge bonus\"having her old friend there at the start of devolution when things were\"really tough\".\n\nSoon, he went to work directly for the first minister, trying to stabilise the Welsh Government and give it a purpose.\n\n\"We saw him as the main intellectual driving force of the left in Wales,\"says Darren Williams, a member of Labour's ruling executive from Cardiff.\n\nIt was a frantic start for devolution. The institution lurched from one controversy to another.\n\nIn the government's Cardiff Bay offices, a former minister says:\"There was always this pool of calm where Mark was sitting on the fifth floor amid the chaos.\"\n\nFormer Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Lord German, deputy first minister in a Labour-led coalition, calls Mr Drakeford the\"Sherpa\"who\"stood at Rhodri's shoulder\".\n\nIn his biography, Mr Morgan, describes an encounter between his right-hand man and Tony Blair's entourage:\"Mark was dressed down in his normal 1960s polytechnic sociology lecturer super-casual gear, tie-less, sloppy sweater and jeans.\"\n\nAnother official present that day in 2002 remembers Mr Drakeford's mobile phone ringing during a speech by Mr Blair at Cardiff's old library. \n\nOff came the trademark sweater as Drakeford\"faffed\"to find the phone.\n\n\"It was painful,\"the witness says.\"Blair, fair play, carried on. It would have been better if he had made a joke.\"\n\nWhen he became a government minister himself, the lecturer's outfit gave way to a suit and tie. Supporters and opponents talk unflatteringly about how he wears it. The habitually undone neck button is now as much a trademark as the\"sloppy sweater\"once was.\n\nThe project to define'Morganism' culminated in the Clear Red Water speech of 2002 to illustrate the difference between Welsh Labour and New Labour.\n\nAlthough Mr Morgan departed from the script and never uttered the key sound bite when he delivered the speech in Swansea, it came to define his leadership.\n\nFree prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes were gimmicks and giveaways to critics. But to the Welsh Government they were part of a vision to make society more equal.\n\nThey called it\"progressive universalism\"- the idea that everyone should enjoy the same access to services - and you can expect more of the same now Mr Drakeford is in charge.\n\nThe Morgan-Drakeford partnership continued through to a coalition with Plaid Cymru.\n\nHelping bring the two sides together, there were meetings with Plaid's future leader, Adam Price, at Mr Drakeford's offices in Cardiff University in 2007.\n\nA source who worked in that coalition government says Mr Drakeford\"created the narrative\".\n\n\"Rhodri's first 20 minutes in cabinet was about what he heard in the pub or in Riverside Market. It drove people bonkers.\n\n\"Mark could articulate what the strategy was that Rhodri was trying to follow.\"\n\nWhen Mr Morgan retired in 2011, Mr Drakeford followed in his footsteps as the AM for Cardiff West.\n\nThe then First Minister Carwyn Jones left him on the backbenches for two years, before giving him arguably the toughest job in the cabinet - health minister.\n\nHis big idea for the service was called prudent healthcare, which involved patients taking more responsibility for their health.\n\nSiobahn McClelland, who held senior positions in the NHS under him, says:\"Whether that actually made a difference to anything is actually a moot point.\"\n\nMr Drakeford's department was bombarded by criticism about waiting times from the UK government and Conservative-supporting newspapers.\n\nHe was determined to ban E-cigs from being used in public places. A former official recalls he\"wouldn't budge\"on the issue.\n\nThe plan faltered when Plaid Cymru withdrew support, partly because another cabinet minister, Leighton Andrews, called the nationalists a\"cheap date\".\n\nMemories of the episode still annoy Mr Drakeford, but Prof McClelland says:\"There are other things we should be doing that are going to make a bigger difference.\"\n\nAfter the 2016 election, he became finance secretary as the Welsh Government prepared for tax powers and the de-facto Brexit minister.\n\nDetecting a growing appetite to stop Brexit within Labour, his two leadership opponents this year tried to outflank him by demanding a further referendum. But he stuck to the line that his job was to prepare for Brexit, not fight it.\n\nMr Drakeford says he wrestled with the idea of succeeding Carwyn Jones, not least because of the impact on his family - wife Clare and their three grown-up children.\n\nA friend says he was\"conflicted\". Was Wales ready for an atheist, republican, socialist first minister?\n\nGossip intensified in the months after Carl Sargeant died days after being sacked as a minister - and when Mr Jones told Welsh Labour's conference in April that he was going, there was a clamour from his friends for Mr Drakeford to stand.\n\n\"I think he would be a blessing to Wales,\"Ms Hutt said at the time.\n\nWhatever his doubts, Mr Drakeford says he became fully committed to the contest.\n\nAnd after the emotional toll of Carl Sargeant's death, Mr Drakeford's supporters think he is someone they can rally around.\n\nHe is the right man for this time\"because of what happened with Carl\", says Julie Morgan.\n\nAdmirers and former colleagues talk about how clever he is and how his experiences as a probation officer taught him how hard life can be.\n\nWill he thrive as leader?\n\nLeanne Wood, who followed the same career path, from the probation service to leading a party, says:\"He's got the right value base, I would say, but you need discipline and doing the job is a lot harder than it looks.\n\n\"What you see is only a fraction of what goes on. So much is behind the scenes.\"\n\nMr Drakeford is used to working behind the scenes. Now we'll see whether he thrives in the limelight.\nTL;DR: After years at the heart of government, Mark Drakeford today starts in the top job. BBC Wales' political correspondent Daniel Davies has spoken to friends, colleagues and opponents of the Welsh Labour leader about his politics, personality and the sort of first minister he will be.\n\nArticle: The journalists were outside a police station in the capital Managua, complaining that raids on the offices of a news website were illegal.\n\nWitnesses said riot police armed with batons dispersed them with force.\n\nNicaragua has been rocked by months of protests against President Daniel Ortega.\n\nThe anti-government protests were declared illegal by Mr Ortega in September following five months of often violent clashes in which hundreds of people were killed.

He said the website would continue to denounce\"the abuses of the regime\".\n\nNicaraguan police have so far not commented on Saturday's alleged assault on the journalists.\n\nDemonstrators in the Central American country first rallied against planned changes to the country's social security system, but the protests soon escalated to include the demand for President Ortega to resign.\n\nMr Ortega, who has been in power since 2007, accuses the demonstrators of planning to overthrow his democratically-elected government and of inciting violence.\n\nLocal human rights groups as well as the United Nations Office for Human Rights have documented alleged human rights violations which range from illegal detention to torture.\nTL;DR: Nicaraguan police are reported to have kicked and beaten several journalists who were protesting against raids on their offices.\n\nArticle: A body believed to be that of the missing Belfast teenager was found in a storm drain on Saturday.\n\nThe 14-year-old was last seen near the Shore Road in north Belfast a week ago.\n\nIn a statement, his family said:\"He was very special. It is very hard to do justice or honour the extraordinary relationship Noah and his mummy shared.\"\n\nIt added:\"In his 14 years his mummy got so much from their special bond, he taught his mummy so much. They were each other's world.\"\n\nThe Donohoe family said they needed to\"express our heartfelt gratitude for the support, outpouring of love, and empathy we have received\".\n\n\"From walking with us, both physically and spiritually, to feeling our pain, we recognise that everyone has lost Noah,\"the statement said.\n\n\"Noah loved his school and his friends at school, and we know that they will be grieving too and they need to say goodbye too.\n\n\"Eventually we will come back to people individually to express our overwhelming gratitude.\"\n\nHis mother Fiona and the entire family circle\"wish to say thank you to each and everyone of you from the bottom of our hearts\".\n\nThe family said details of Noah's funeral will follow.\n\nA number of family members attended a vigil in north Belfast on Sunday evening.\n\nThey released 14 blue balloons, in memory of Noah.\n\nPeople clapped as the Community Rescue Service volunteers, who looked for Noah, walked past.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Noah's school said it was\"blessed to have had such an outstanding student and person as a most valued member of our family\".\n\nSt Malachy's College said Noah's\"caring nature, calm demeanour and big smile were some of his great gifts that helped others do their best\".\n\nThe school said that Noah was a talented musician and keen rugby and basketball player.\n\nHe also received a number of awards in his three years at the school, including The Spirit of the College Award, full attendance and class prizes.\n\n\"We are all deeply saddened at Noah's passing away, and we offer prayers for and support to his mother, Fiona, family members, friends and also his extended family - all of us associated with St Malachy's College,\"the statement added.\n\n\"Noah will always be a treasured member of our Malachian family.\"\n\n'Talented, loving and gifted'\n\nBishop Noel Treanor said\"words cannot begin to describe the experience of distress and sense of pain and heartache that the Donohoe family are feeling at this time\".\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Diocese of Down and Connor, he offered his sympathies to the family and paid tribute to those who helped with the search.\n\n\"Those who have assisted in the search for Noah and the wider community have come to learn about the life of a talented, loving and gifted young man who brought so much joy and blessing to his family, his friends, his classmates and teachers in St Malachy's College, and all those who knew him,\"Bishop Treanor said.\n\nKevin Sharkey, BBC News NI reporter\n\nFew\"missing person\"cases in recent times have captured the attention of the public like the week-long search for 14-year-old Noah Donohoe. \n\nThe mystery of the Belfast schoolboy's disappearance and the events in the minutes before he went missing left a community bewildered. \n\nThe public reaction to his disappearance was stirring. There was an impulsive outpouring of support and solidarity for his family. \n\nThis was a local community unwittingly cast into a lead role in a wider society mission of mercy. \n\nThe schoolboy had disappeared in their area and they were determined to lead the public efforts to find him. \n\nAnd, for the first few days, they did. \n\nAt the request of Noah's family, along with the police and trained community search and rescue teams, the civilian volunteers had pulled back on Thursday. \n\nThey heeded the call to give the trained and specialised teams space to conduct targeted searches. \n\nDay after day, PSNI Supt Muir Clark assured the missing boy's family that his officers and community rescue teams would do everything possible to find their boy. \n\nOn one occasion, he was joined at a press briefing by Noah's mother, Fiona, and her two sisters. Fiona's anguish was heart-rending. \n\nLike the initial disappearance of the schoolboy, the tragic outcome has stunned the local communities around the Shore Road and neighbouring areas. \n\nCommunities who came together, stood united, and helped out as one. They told me they did it for Noah and his heartbroken family. \n\nSupt Muir Clark said on Saturday that he did not believe there was any foul play involved in the death.\n\nIn a tweet, the PSNI said it reiterated that it was\"disappointing that we again need to call on people circulating a number of rumours about Noah's disappearance, which are completely without foundation\".\nTL;DR: Noah Donohoe's mother \"always told him that he would change the world\", his family has said.\n\nArticle: Detectives investigating the bombing at the Mountainview Tavern arrested the man in County Antrim and he is being questioned at Antrim police station.\n\nFive people were killed and 60 injured in the attack on Grand National Saturday in 1975.\n\nThe investigation into the attack was re-opened following a review by the Historical Enquiries Team.\n\nThe attack happened at about 6pm.

The ESM - with a 500bn-euro (\u00a3400bn) war chest - will handle future bailouts.\n\nSo several obstacles that might have spooked the markets have been cleared from the path. Some European officials - who last year declared the crisis over - are hopeful once again.\n\nIt helped that the Dutch electorate, at the last moment, shied away from backing parties openly critical of the centralising power of Brussels.\n\nThe days of unbending austerity are over in Europe. Officials and leaders are operating on flexi-time.\n\nThe ECB was given the nod from Berlin to agree to buy unlimited bonds of those countries in trouble.\n\nPortugal, unable to meet its targets, has been given more time.\n\nIf Spain applies for a full bailout there are powerful voices saying no new conditions will be necessary. The promise that help comes with\"strict conditionality\"may not be kept.\n\nGreece is certainly being told it must live up to its commitments, but talk of a Greek exit from the eurozone has suddenly disappeared from political circles in Berlin. Chancellor Merkel will not sanction it.\n\nMore Europe?\n\nSuddenly there is the glimpse of a looser monetary policy, of targets relaxed and of debt being mutualised.\n\nIronically the key to this is national politics. There is now just over a year until elections in Germany. Chancellor Merkel does not want the eurozone crisis to dominate the campaign. That may be wishful thinking but compromise is the word of the moment. \n\nThe eurozone crisis - as widely predicted - is being used to justify deeper integration. President Barroso is calling for\"a federation of nation states\".  Mrs Merkel is signed up for\"more Europe\". \n\nThe danger in this is that Europe will turn inward, obsessed by its own structures, unleashing intense debate about the Europe of the future. President Barroso hints at treaty change by 2014. \n\nSelling more Europe will be a difficult task when the polls suggest increasing alienation from the European project. \n\nIn the meantime there is the real economy. There are over 24m people out of work. Recession, in some countries, is deepening. Debt is still climbing, growth elusive. \n\nIn some countries, like Greece, Spain and Italy consensus is fragile. There are some green shoots: exports to countries outside Europe are increasing and some competitiveness is returning. \n\nSo\"A Good Day For Europe\"- perhaps. But not yet for the real economy. And that is where Europe will be judged.\nTL;DR: Chancellor Merkel stood before the ranks of the Bundestag yesterday and declared it \"a good day for Europe\".\n\nArticle: Official figures show that there were 348 offences in 2017-18 - the lowest since current records began in 1980.\n\nThis was a fall of 1% (two offences) from the previous year.\n\nOffences in which a firearm caused fatal or non-fatal injuries fell by two to 41 in 2017-18.

Other locations include inside a motor vehicle, licensed premises, and other outside locations.\n\nSix offences took place in a school or college involving the alleged use of a firearm. This represents a 45% decrease from the previous year, when 11 offences were recorded in 2016-17.\n\nIn total, seven offences involving the alleged use of a firearm happened in a bank, building society or post office in 2017-18, with a further four in places of public entertainment in 2017-18.\n\nAn air weapon was the only type of weapon used in offences that happened in a school/college, bank, building society or place of public entertainment in 2017-18.\n\nIn 2017-18, 69% of all offences involving a firearm were cleared up, with homicides and serious assaults at a rate of 100% and common assaults at 86%.\n\nType of weapons used\n\nIn 2017-18, the local authority areas of Glasgow City (64), South Lanarkshire (35) and North Lanarkshire (28) had the highest number of offences involving firearms.\n\nWhen cases involving air weapons are excluded - the highest number of offences were recorded in Glasgow City (20), Aberdeen City (18), South Lanarkshire (15), and Aberdeenshire (15).\n\nJustice Secretary Humza Yousaf said:\"These figures show we are continuing to make progress in tackling firearms misuse with offences now at their lowest level for any single year since 1980.\n\n\"While firearms offences are rare, we know that just one such incident can have a devastating impact on victims and the wider community, so we are determined to continue working with our partners to reduce these numbers.\n\n\"Having successfully lobbied to have the relevant powers devolved to the Scottish Parliament, we are the only part of Great Britain to licence air weapons - ensuring that only those with a legitimate need have lawful access to them.\n\n\"Since our licensing legislation was passed in 2015-16 offences involving an air weapon have fallen by a third.

A senior Apple spokesman told reporters in a conference call that he was confident the San Bernardino judge would carefully analyse the New York ruling. \n\nMost promising for Apple is the reason for which Judge Orenstein threw out the New York case. \n\nHe said he was not at all convinced the All Writs Act, a law more than two centuries old, could be used to force Apple to comply. The same law is being used in San Bernardino. \n\nThe All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here. \n\nNo legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant. \n\nApple v the FBI - a plain English guide\n\nApple's boss hits back at FBI conduct\n\nBill Gates calls for terror data debate\n\nFourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December.\n\nA court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information.\n\nApple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was\"an overreach by the US government\"and risked giving authorities\"the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data\".

But, in keeping with French rules, there were no scallops until the end of the breeding season at the start of October.\n\nLike many fishermen here, he is adamant that British boats should abide by those same French rules when it comes to fishing for scallops - even though the UK government has in the past imposed no similar restrictions on its vessels.\n\nTheir refusal to do so justified the attack last week, he argues. \n\n\"Whatever happens,\"he told me,\"I don't think the British will come back, because if they do another confrontation is inevitable. We'll defend our livelihood. I can't just stand by and watch.\"\n\nWhy the scallops skirmish began\n\nFor the past few years, a carefully constructed truce has kept the peace over this watery battlefield. The British agreed to ban their larger fishing vessels from the area until October, in return for extra fishing rights, and on the understanding that smaller British boats could fish there all year round.\n\nBut the number of smaller boats coming across the Channel has been growing and this year the French asked that all British boats stay away from the scallop fishing grounds until the catch could be shared.\n\nSmaller British fishermen are already feeling hard done by because the vast majority of their EU fishing quotas go to larger British industrial fishing fleets, and many struggle to make a profit. \n\nBut scallops are not restricted by standard EU quotas. \n\nLarger vessels have limits on the number of days they can fish for them but smaller boats do not - an important symbolic advantage.\n\nUnder the deal sketched out in London on Wednesday, the limits on bigger boats will remain. But the smaller British boats under 15m (50ft) will be subjected to the same rules and be given compensation for losses. \n\nThe terms still have to be finalised in Paris on Friday. But the two governments said that under a voluntary agreement all UK vessels would\"respect the French closure period in the Baie de Seine\".\n\nMr Quesnel said the conflict was the fault of the leaders, not the fishermen from either side. \n\nThe idea behind the French rule, he said, was\"to let the scallops reproduce, not to fish it all out in three weeks and leave nothing behind. I believe the British boats all came this year to catch as much scallop as possible, because they know they won't have access to these after waters after [Brexit]\".\n\nA few kilometres away, in a tiny shed at Dives-sur-Mer, fish and mussels are being emptied straight from the boats on to a handful of well-scrubbed counters.\n\nOne of the fishermen here, Frank Tousch, remembers the clashes last week as\"frightening\". His tiny boat, Le Sachal'eo, was crushed between La Rose Des Vents and a 30m Scottish vessel, after he joined the demonstration at sea. \n\nHe shows us the cracks still running along the top of the wooden hull which he says will take him two weeks to repair.\n\n\"It pushed me from behind, up against La Rose Des Vents. Then pulled alongside to crush me,\"he said.\"I was very scared; it was such a big boat. We were lucky that our hull was plastic so it bounced back into shape. Had it been all made of wood, it would have been crushed.\"\n\nFrank agrees that the only way to solve the stand-off is for all British boats to observe the same restrictions as French fishermen.\n\nThe owner of La Rose Des Vents, Fabrice Huout, joins us at the market. Despite the attack on British vessels, he says, the anger is not personal.  \n\n\"They're fishermen like us,\"he said. \n\nI asked him whether he'd do the same in British waters if the situation were reversed. His response:\"Why not, if we were allowed to?\"\n\nBack at Ouistreham, Anthony Quesnel is preparing to head to sea again, keeping an eye out for British fishing boats along the way.\n\nLast week's attack was hastily organised, he told me, and many of the 300 local fishermen didn't get enough notice to join in.  \n\nNext time, he says, they will.\nTL;DR: A deal has been reached to bring an end to the skirmishes between French and British fishermen in the Channel, but boat captains on the Normandy coast have vowed to fight on if any British boats come near their fishing grounds before October. \n\nThe agreement is yet to be signed and among those with most at stake are the two captains of La Rose Des Vents and Le Sachal'eo, whose dramatic collision with a Scottish trawler last week was caught on video.\n\nArticle: In experiments on worms, University of Cambridge researchers identified drugs which prevented the very first step towards brain cell death.\n\nThey now want to match

10%. \n\nThe new rate applies to nearly all goods and services, though most food will be exempt.\n\nPast sales tax rises in the world's third largest economy have hit spending.\n\nThis time, however, the government has introduced measures, including rebates for certain purchases made using electronic payments, in a bid to offset the blow.  \n\nIt plans to use the extra revenues to fund social welfare programmes including pre-school education and to pay down its huge public debt load. \n\n\"The government has already pledged about half the revenues to fund free childcare,\"said Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics. \n\nWhat will be covered? \n\nThe tax hike applies to most goods and services, from electronics to books and cars. Most food items will remain exempt. \n\nConsumers will be eligible for a 5% rebate on purchases made using electronic payments at some smaller retailers - outstripping the 2% tax rise. \n\nThe move is designed to mitigate the impact of the tax increase, as well as drive up the use of electronic payments in cash-reliant Japan. \n\nMartin Schulz, senior research fellow at the Fujitsu Research Institute, said the rebates are designed\"to make the economy more productive\". \n\nHow will it impact the economy?  \n\nJapan's economy has performed strongly in recent months but the tax hike - along with uncertainty in the global economy - weigh on its outlook. \n\nThe slowdown in China and the trade war with the US have knocked business confidence in Japan, as it also grapples with softer global demand for its exports including electronic equipment and car parts. \n\nPrevious sales tax rises have seen spending drop off sharply. But this time around, economists expect the hit will be more modest. \n\n\"The impact will almost certainly be smaller,\"Mr Thieliant said, as the lead-up to the tax rise saw fewer pre-emptive purchases of big items like televisions and cars than previous hikes.

This will be a challenge for him. \n\nHe was always the front runner, but this result is closer than many people expected. He had the bulk of the support from Labour's big institutions, including Momentum - which has swelled the ranks of Welsh Labour members in the last couple of years.\n\nThis result is not the resounding victory many predicted. One senior Labour figure and Drakeford supporter whispered to me:\"That was close.\"\n\nAnother said:\"A win's a win\".\n\n\"Who can remember what Carwyn's margin of victory was nine years ago?\"\n\nMr Jones announced in April he would step down by the end of 2018 - he has been in the job for nine years.\n\nThe Welsh Labour leader-elect told BBC Wales the party was going through a\"healing process\"after a turbulent twelve months following the death of Carl Sargeant.\n\nThe former communities minister was found dead in November 2017 days after Mr Jones sacked him from his cabinet.\n\n'Richness of ideas'\n\nMr Drakeford said:\"The [leadership] election is part of that healing process.\"\n\nHe said he would work to give Wales a\"future which works for the many in our society and not simply for a privileged few\".\n\nIn his acceptance speech he paid tribute to the defeated candidates, saying the\"richness of ideas\"they contributed in the campaign would make Welsh Labour\"a stronger party with a greater reservoir of commitment and strength\".\n\nMr Drakeford said the ultimate aim was to have\"a Labour government in Westminster working with a Labour government in Wales\".\n\n\"Our most radical and successful days lie ahead of us\", he added. \n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who Mr Drakeford had supported during UK Labour leadership elections, said:\"Mark will demonstrate what Labour in government can achieve by building a more equal society, even in the face of the Conservatives' callous austerity agenda\".\n\n\"I know Mark will relentlessly fight for the interests of the Welsh people and stand up to the Tories' chronic underinvestment in Wales compared to other parts of the UK, particularly London,\"he added.\n\nMr Jones will tender his resignation to the Queen next Tuesday.\n\nBefore the result Mr Jones said it had been the\"greatest honour of my life\"to be first minister.\n\nHe said Welsh Labour\"will never stop until we see more justice, more fairness, more opportunity and more equality\".\n\nVoters in the election were able to vote for a first and second preference candidate. In the first round, Mark Drakeford won 46.9% of the vote, versus 30.8% for Vaughan Gething and 22.3% Eluned Morgan.\n\nAfter Eluned Morgan came third in the first round, the second preference votes of those who supported her were redistributed.\n\nAs a result, Mark Drakeford got 53.9% while Vaughan Gething received 41.4%.\n\nJust over half - 53.1% - of the circa 25,000 party members voted in the Welsh Labour leadership election.\n\nA total of 5.67% of the around 150,000 members of affiliated groups including trade unions, voted.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n'No mandate'\n\nUnder the rules of the assembly Mr Drakeford must be confirmed by AMs.\n\nThis is expected to take place next week.

Hilda was never seen again and Roque's remains were only identified a month ago - 36 years later.\n\nBut Victoria - who was less than a month old - was not handed over to her biological relatives. Instead she was taken by an army colonel and his wife. And, crucially, she was given a new identity. \n\nVictoria only learned the truth when she became an adult.\n\n'Healing society'\n\nThis was not an isolated incident at the time. \n\nThe Argentine justice has now convicted two former Argentine leaders - and another seven people - of carrying out a systematic plan to steal babies from political prisoners.\n\nFormer ruler Jorge Videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison, whilst Reynaldo Bignone got 15 years.\n\nOfficial records show that 105 of the\"stolen babies\"have now regained their real identity. In most cases their adoptive parents have faced criminal charges. \n\nHuman rights group Grandmothers of May Square believes there could be hundreds more. \n\nThis organisation has been demanding for years that the Argentine justice rule that there was a systematic theft of children. \n\nAnd Thursday's verdict is the result of the group's long and hard work. \n\n\"This is justice. It has arrived. Remember that we started in 1996, and at that time we didn't know whether or not we would ever see this moment,\"says Estela de Carlotto, the president of Grandmothers. \n\nMrs de Carlotto believes that this verdict will be\"healing for the Argentine society\".\n\nThose directly affected share her opinion.\n\n\"What has happened (the sentencing) is liberating,\"says Victoria Montenegro.\n\n\"With this verdict we can start repairing the damages caused by our history, even though this history still causes us pain,\"she adds. \n\nEmotional debate\n\nVictoria's story is an example of the complexities of what it means to be a\"stolen baby\".\n\nIn some cases the learning of the true identity results in the person embracing his biological relatives completely. \n\nBut this is not always the case. \n\nSome either prefer not to know or when they do find out they remain with the parents who raised them - even if they were directly involved in the death of their biological parents.\n\nVictoria's case is a mixture of both, which makes her story almost unique.\n\nWhen her adoptive father told her that her parents were left-wing activists that he himself had helped to arrest, she replied:\"I understand that you had to do it.\"\n\nShe even remembers feeling a strong fear of rejection from her adoptive parents because of her biological parents being left-wing dissidents.\n\n\"For 25 years I was strongly indoctrinated. I was told that all this happened because the country was at war against left-wing groups and that all those allegedly disappeared were liars,\"she says.\n\nVictoria, or Maria Sol still then, even spoke in favour of her adoptive parents when they went on trial for her kidnapping.\n\nBut during her life as Maria Sol she felt\"some things were not right\". \n\n\"The worst years came when I started to come to terms with my situation and I had this huge internal emotional debate,\"she says.\n\n\"It took many years for me to process this. But in the end it was like a river that returned to its course.\"\n\nVictoria's adoptive parents died several years ago without ever being convicted or jailed.\n\nShe admits that, despite everything, she\"could not stop loving them\".\n\n\"But I do know that - even if I could still have nice feelings for them - they stole something basic from me: The identity I was given by my real parents.\n\n\"Stealing a baby cannot be an act of love,\"she adds.\nTL;DR: Victoria Montenegro lived for 25 years under the name Maria Sol Tetzlaff, until she knew the truth.

After the government started enforcing the rule of one child per family - often forcibly - my parents would sometimes jokingly remind me that I was an\"exceeded quota person\", meaning that under the one-child policy I would not have existed. \n\nChairman Mao, who led China from 1949 until his death in 1976, regarded a fast-growing population as a productive force necessary for China to become a great power. \n\nHe treated brutally those who dared to question him and believed that China should control its population.\n\nHis successor Deng Xiaoping started to reverse the trend.\n\nHe felt the tremendous drag China's huge population had on its fragile economic recovery after years of political turmoil.\n\nOn 25 September 1980, the Politburo of the Communist Party issued an\"open letter\"to all members of the party and the Communist youth league, urging them to take the lead in having only one child.\n\nThis is widely seen as the beginning of the controversial one-child policy.\n\nThe government claims that the policy has helped the country achieve 400 million fewer births during the past 30 years. \n\nBut this has come at a painful cost - keenly felt by my generation and those after us. \n\nOne of my childhood friends, who didn't want to reveal his name, has had to let his daughter, his second child, call him uncle in order to escape punishment for breaking the rule. \n\nHe says it breaks his heart every time he talks about his daughter, who is officially registered as someone else's child.\n\nA female friend, like countless other young couples in China, had to pay a large fine for having a second child. But she believed the money was worth it.\n\nFalling fertility    \n\nOfficials have repeatedly stressed that this\"fundamental policy of the state\", which has been credited with helping reduce the pressure of population growth on society and economic development, will continue.\n\nBut the government has already been challenged over whether the 400 million fewer births were entirely due to the implementation of this policy. \n\nA team of independent Chinese and foreign academics completed what they said was the first systematic examination of the one-child policy three years ago. \n\nThey pointed out that the reduction was mainly due to a fall in the fertility rate (the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime) in the 1970s when the government began to encourage delayed marriages, longer intervals between births and fewer children.\n\nAccording to Professor Wang Feng of the University of California, who led the study, China's fertility rate was reduced from more than five to just over two before family planning policy was introduced in 1978. \n\nThe debate over whether the one-child policy is still needed was recently stirred up by a newspaper report about the little publicised case of Yicheng county, in the northern province of Shanxi. \n\nYicheng has been experimenting with a two-child policy for 25 years, said The Southern Weekend, a liberal newspaper based in the southern city of Guangzhou, close to Hong Kong. \n\nDespite its more relaxed regulations, the county has a lower than average population growth rate, the report said. \n\nAfter three decades, the drawbacks of the one-child policy are more and more apparent.\n\nEven though China still has the largest population in the world, a report last month by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a leading government think tank, said officials were seriously overestimating the fertility rate. \n\nInstead of suppressing it, the report said the government should try to lift it. More and more people in China, largely in urban areas, prefer to have fewer children. \n\nIt is unclear when Beijing might end the one-child policy.  But attention will be focused on an upcoming meeting of the party central committee next month. \n\nIt will finalise a five-year social and economic development plan, only the 12th since the Communist Party took power in 1949.  \n\nClearly, the situation is becoming urgent. Already the country's population is ageing fast. The first children born under the one-child policy face the prospect of caring for an ever-increasing number of pensioners. \n\nChina also faces the daunting prospect of many men who can't find wives as many female foetuses have been aborted, resulting in a huge gender imbalance.\n\nThe clock is ticking.\nTL;DR: During the period that I grew up in China in the 1960s and 70s, Chinese families could have as many children as they liked. Many had four or five children. Some even had six or seven.\n\nArticle: Candidates standing in Nottinghamshire Police's area are listed alphabetically by surname. \n\nMore information is available on the Choose my PCC website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

If you are suspected of a serious crime like murder, they can ask a court for permission to hold you further, up to a maximum of 14 days in terrorism cases. \n\nBalance of rights\n\nCreating a balance between the police's right to\"confiscate and investigate\"and the individual's right to travel is likely to be the parliamentary battleground. \n\nBut critics will still say that this bill puts too much unchecked power in the hands of the state - not least because of the proposed TEOs.\n\nFour conditions must be met for the home secretary to use this power: \n\nIf she then imposes a TEO, the individual can't get back into the country unless the home secretary issues a permit - or they have no choice because they've been deported home. \n\nHow do you get a permit? By agreeing to a number of conditions, such as a police interview or admission to some kind of de-radicalisation scheme. \n\nPutting aside the practical question of whether any nation would happily house the UK's suspects just because the government doesn't want them back, the whole point of a TEO is to create some kind of breathing space for the\"managed return\"of people about whom the security services have concerns. \n\nBut TEOs will face tough questions in parliament and, almost certainly, a slew of legal challenges as soon as they are used. \n\nPresumption of guilt\n\nOne major criticism is that TEOs lead to somebody being\"sort of guilty\"without being convicted of a crime or going through a legal process to justify restrictions on freedom. \n\nDavid Anderson QC, the terror laws watchdog, put it another way when asked by MPs what he thought: where are the courts in all of this?  \n\nWhen the home secretary imposes a TPim monitoring order against a terrorism suspect, there is an automatic review of that decision by a judge - including examining in secret the intelligence used to justify the move. \n\nThere is no such automatic judicial oversight built into examining the rationale for imposing a TEO. \n\nThat means that someone could find themselves barred from the UK until they accept a form of monitoring - even if they would want to argue that it is unnecessary because they pose no threat to their own country. \n\nThere are precedents: not a single Muslim who 20 years ago went to fight against the Serbs in Bosnia faced prosecution in the UK for doing so. More recently, Whitehall was quite relaxed about British-Libyans leaving the UK to fight alongside other jihadists against Col Gaddafi's regime. \n\nThe Danes have, in contrast, started to do it differently. \n\nThey are allowing fighters to return home in the hope that the authorities get a better chance to differentiate between those who will go back to a quiet life and those who are genuinely dangerous.\n\nThe British want to be able to do the same - it is just that the route to getting there is different.\nTL;DR: Monday sees the return of the government's  Counter Terrorism and Security Bill  to the Commons where MPs will get their say on the legislation's most controversial measure: should ministers be able to ban British citizens from coming home?\n\nArticle: By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nYet when Steve Ballmer announced his retirement as chief executive of Microsoft in August, shareholders did exactly that, sending the shares up more than 7%.\n\nHolders of the stock, who have seen the once-undisputed tech leader fall far behind rivals such as Google and Apple during Ballmer's 13-year reign, were clearly delighted at the prospect of a new leader. \n\nBut those who were hoping for an outsider with fresh ideas were disappointed when Satya Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, was chosen for the top job.\n\nCritics say Mr Nadella's longevity at the firm suggests that he is not a radical enough thinker.\n\nYet, research shows Microsoft is in good company by choosing an insider for the job. \n\nAccording to global consulting firm Booz and Company's most recent annual study of the world's largest public companies, when new chief executives were appointed in 2012, insiders were chosen 71% of the time.\n\nAnd a quarter of these new chief executives had worked at the firm for their entire career. \n\n\"Companies often seek familiarity in a new chief executive. Though the companies we studied are large ones, most of which operate on a global scale, they tend to stick close to home when picking a chief executive,\"said Gary Neilson, from Booz and Company.\n\nMorale boost\n\nThe arguments for choosing an internal candidate are well rehearsed: they understand both the firm and the industry, putting them in a good position to initiate the change necessary for growth.\n\n\"If a person has developed internally then they are likely to have the trust of the executive board and will have a clear understanding of the culture and how to get things done,\"says Claire McCartney, adviser at HR industry body, the CIPD.\n\nAn internal appointment will also often boost morale - demonstrating to those lower down the ranks what can be achieved if you stick it out for the long term.\n\n\"Promoting people internally is a strong retention tool because it allows employees to see the progression opportunities. It is a lot less disruptive and means they avoid rehashing the mistakes of their predecessors,\"says Neil Owen, global director of recruitment firm Robert Half Financial Services.\n\nHowever, for internal promotions to be effective, companies need to start examining potential candidates long before a senior staff member calls it quits. \n\nMr Owen says firms need to determine which positions must never be left vacant in the firm, identify staff with potential and ensure they get the necessary training. \n\n\"This needs to happen at all levels in the company. For large organisations with multiple divisions and geographies that takes time, potentially years, and won't breed immediate success.\"\n\nFamiliarity breeds contempt?\n\nBut of course entirely home-grown leaders can have their downsides. They will have witnessed, and more than likely helped, to define the firm's strategy - making it harder to challenge and implement changes, particularly if they need to go against colleagues who helped smooth their path to the top.\n\nMeanwhile, they may also have to deal with the spectre of their former boss, or in Mr Nadella's case, bosses. \n\nOutgoing chief executive Steve Ballmer will continue to sit on Microsoft's board, while Bill Gates is also going to be spending more time at the firm in his new role as technology adviser, potentially making it tough for Mr Nadella to shift the firm's direction. \n\n\"It's going to be enormously difficult for a new CEO to make the company over again in their image. Finding a way to build on his predecessors' work but also set his own direction is Nadella's absolutely top priority,\"says Steve Ranger, editor-in-chief of technology websites TechRepublic and ZDNet UK.\n\nKey factor\n\nIn his book, The CEO Within, Harvard professor Joseph Bower suggests the compromise is to groom so-called\"insider outsiders\"as future leaders.\n\nThese are internal candidates who somehow have managed to maintain a level of detachment from the firm, despite spending years there. \n\n\"These leaders view their role through the lens of someone who just bought the company unencumbered by the cognitive and emotional baggage that comes from a long tenure in the organisation. \n\n\"But they also leverage the knowledge they've accumulated about the company's people, suppliers and customers, and future direction,\"he says.\n\nUltimately, whether you come from inside or outside the organisation is irrelevant, according to Amanda Goodall, senior lecturer in management at Cass Business School. The key factor is\"genuine expertise\".\n\nShe has researched leadership at hospitals, professional basketball teams and Formula One. In all these cases, Ms Goodall found that organisations whose leaders came from the floor performed the best. \n\nSo basketball teams that won the most games were led by former star players, the best hospitals were led by chief executives who were previously doctors, and F1 teams led by former drivers or mechanics won races twice as often as other kinds of leaders.\n\n\"The picture my research paints is that chief executives should have a deep understanding of the core business they lead. It's not only about understanding the sector, but also about understanding the business. It points to expert knowledge,\"she says.\nTL;DR: When you let your colleagues know you are leaving your job the last thing you want to hear is cheers.\n\nArticle: Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Sarah McIver's case is different from that of two other recently detained Canadians.  \n\nHer detention came amid a dispute between both countries following the arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive earlier this month.\n\nMs Hua said both countries are maintaining consular communication. \n\nCanada's National Post newspaper reported that sources told them that Ms McIver had been working at a school in China when she was detained, apparently due to issues with her work visa. \n\nMs Hua said she was\"serving administrative punishment due to illegal employment\". \n\nFormer diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were both taken into custody in China shortly after the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, in Vancouver on 1 December.\n\nMr Kovrig and Mr Spavor are being held on accusations of harming national security. Canadian diplomats were granted consular access to both men last week. \n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he was\"very concerned\"about the third detained citizen but noted Canada believed her case was different from Mr Kovrig's and Mr Spavor's. \n\nChina has denied the detention of both men is tied to Ms Meng's arrest, but many analysts believe it was a tit-for-tat action.\n\nBeijing had threatened unspecified consequences if Ms Meng was not released.\n\nMs Meng has been granted bail but may face extradition to the US on charges of violating American sanctions on Iran through Huawei's business dealings.

It had been intended to reach the waterfront at Leith and Newhaven, and there were to be other lines too, but they fell away as the troubled project rumbled on.\n\nThe idea of bringing back trams to Edinburgh's congested streets goes back many years but the current saga can be said to have begun in September 2003.\n\nBack then the Labour-led Scottish Executive earmarked \u00a3375m, indexed for inflation, for the proposed tram routes linking the city centre with both Leith and Edinburgh Airport. It was hoped trams would be operational by 2009.\n\nNow, more than five years behind schedule, Edinburgh has trams on its streets for the first time since 1956 but just one route, not the network that was envisaged.\n\nThe 8.7mile (14km) route stretches from Edinburgh airport to York Place in the city centre, with 15 stops along the way.\n\nIt has cost of \u00a3776m, plus more than \u00a3200m in interest on a 30-year loan taken out by the council to cover the funding shortfall. \n\nIt is something of a miracle it ever got finished at all, given the disputes along the way.\n\nThe entire project was going to be scrapped by the SNP when the Nationalists formed their first minority government at Holyrood in 2007, only for the decision to be overturned by the will of the other parties in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nAnd four years ago a bitter dispute between the arms-length company responsible for bringing trams to Edinburgh and its main contractor brought the whole project to a halt for months.\n\nWhen David Mackay quit as chairman of Transport Edinburgh Limited he branded the project\"hell on wheels\". \n\nMr Mackay described the main contractor on the tram works, Bilfinger Berger, as a\"delinquent company that smelled a victim\".\n\nDuring the darkest days of the dispute, the German construction giant said nothing publicly due to contractual restrictions. \n\nBut there is little doubt that Bilfinger Berger's executives were similarly left frustrated and angry by TIE's handling of the project.\n\nAdd to all this the fact that vital roads in Edinburgh city centre and Leith were dug up for the best part of seven years, causing congestion, inconvenience and financial harm to businesses and it is little wonder that the dream of a tram system to rival any in Europe is now such a painful idea for the people of Scotland's capital.\n\nAs Edinburgh's elegant streets were transformed into a giant building site, initial scepticism was replaced by downright opposition.\n\nIt is often said by locals that Edinburgh has one of Britain's best bus services but the city council developed a new transport plan at the start of the millennium and trams were a priority.\n\nAt first the tram project was dependent on the revenues from a road-charging scheme that the City of Edinburgh Council wanted to implement, similar to that introduced in London in 2003.\n\nBut when the controversial road tolls were rejected after a public outcry, the tram scheme sailed on, backed by cash from the Scottish government of the time. \n\nBy September 2005, as the parliamentary bills for the line made their way through Holyrood the cost was put at \u00a3539m.\n\nThe new estimates of cost prove too much for the council which shelved the Granton-Newhaven and Edinburgh airport-Newbridge sections.\n\nIn March 2006 the legislation was passed in parliament, with completion now put back to 2011 and the first work to divert utility pipes and cables in Leith began in March 2007.\n\nBut work stopped as the Scottish Parliament elections arrived and in May 2007, the new SNP administration at Holyrood tried to press ahead with its pledge to scrap the trams project.\n\nHowever, opposition parties outvoted the minority government and it was forced to hand-over almost \u00a3500m for the project.\n\nThe Scottish government's finance secretary John Swinney said he would give the project the cash already agreed and\"not a penny more\". Any further cash would have to be found by the City of Edinburgh Council.\n\nConstruction could now begin and a whole new range of problems arrived.\n\nThe city centre was left gridlocked when work began on Princes Street at The Mound due to a\"catastrophic failure\"of traffic management and similar stories bubbled up wherever the tram works went.\n\nPrinces Street, the main route through the centre of Scotland's capital, remained closed to traffic for most of 2009, an annus horribilis for the project.\n\nA dispute between Tie, which was overseeing the project, and the construction consortium spiralled out of control and a legal dispute dragged on for many months, putting back the finish of the project and driving up costs.\n\nIn October 2010 council officials admitted the tram line would only run to St Andrew Square in the city centre, the plan to continue to Leith and Newhaven bit the dust.\n\nNext the chairman of the Edinburgh tram company resigned and work ground to a complete standstill. \n\n2011 saw some sort of resolution with the contractor but a fresh crisis emerged as the council realised it did not have the money to complete the project.\n\nEdinburgh's city council came up with a plan to stop the line at Haymarket, more than a mile west of the city centre, a decision which was labelled as\"bonkers\"by the city's Chambers of Commerce.\n\nThe Scottish government had to wade in again and refused to provide the final \u00a372m of its funding if the line did not go to the city centre, forcing the council into a u-turn.\n\nIn contrast to the troubled history of the project its final two years have been relatively smooth, although by this stage it was hard to imagine what else could go wrong.\n\nConstruction of the line was finished at the end of last year and testing of the trams has been going on for several months.\n\nNow Edinburgh is ready to get on-board its trams for the first time. \n\nBut the people of Edinburgh may take some time to love them.\nTL;DR: Trams will return to Edinburgh's streets for the first time in almost 50 years, when the service begins on Saturday. However, in the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as was first thought.\n\nArticle: Chivas announced in November last year that it planned to close its operations in Paisley and spend \u00a340m on a new state-of-the-art facility in Dumbarton.\n\nIt said all permanent employees based in Paisley would transfer to the new site within three years.\n\nChivas said work on the bottling hall would begin immediately.\n\nChief executive Laurent Lacassagne said:\"With an 80-year history in Dumbarton, we're proud to be investing and expanding in this community and look forward to progressing the project to the next stage.\"\n\nWhen it made the announcement last year, Chivas Brothers had 460 full-time employees at Paisley and 600 at Kilmalid.\n\nThe new facility was scheduled for completion by the end of 2019.\n\nChivas Brothers is part of drinks giant Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe company's portfolio includes Chivas Regal, Ballantine's, Beefeater Gin and The Glenlivet.\nTL;DR: Spirits producer Chivas Brothers has been given planning permission for a new bottling plant at its Kilmalid site in Dumbarton.\n\nArticle: By Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check\n\nSupporters of Brexit see it as a symbol of sovereignty that will now be regained. The UK says any new agreement on fisheries must be based on the understanding that\"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\".\n\nBut the EU wants access for its boats and says reaching a\"fair deal\"on fisheries is a pre-condition for a free trade agreement (with no tariffs or taxes on goods crossing borders). \n\nSo, while fishing is a tiny part of the economy on both sides of the Channel, it carries big political weight.  \n\nHow do fishing controls work?\n\nThe UK formally left the EU on 31 January, but is still bound by the EU's rules, including its Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), until the end of this year.\n\nThat means the fishing fleets of every country involved have full access to each other's waters, apart from the first 12 nautical miles (14 miles; 22km) out from the coast. \n\nBut they can't catch whatever they like. EU ministers gather for marathon talks every December to haggle over the volume of fish that can be caught from each species.  \n\nNational quotas are then divided up using historical data going back to the 1970s, when the UK fishing industry says it got a bad deal. \n\nThat's why the government wants to increase the British quota share significantly.\n\nIt's an argument complicated by the fact that parts of the British quota have been sold off by British skippers to boats based elsewhere in the EU. \n\nIn England, for example, more than half the quota is in foreign hands.\n\nOverall, more than 60% of the tonnage landed from English waters is caught by foreign boats.\n\nHow could Brexit change this?\n\nOutside the EU, as an\"independent coastal state\", the UK will control what's known as an exclusive economic zone (EEZ), stretching up to 200 nautical miles into the North Atlantic.   \n\nInside the EU, the EEZs of all member countries are managed jointly as a common resource.\n\nThe government wants to hold annual talks on access to UK and EU waters, and on quotas - using a system that works out shares based on the percentage of each species of fish in each EEZ (this is known as\"zonal attachment\").\n\nThat's what other independent coastal states such as Norway do. And fishing communities in the UK, which were strong supporters of the campaign to leave the EU, are insisting on this basic change. \n\nBut because UK waters are so important, and so bountiful, the EU is under huge pressure from its fishing communities to maintain as much of the status quo as possible. \n\nIt wants the UK to grant significant access, with only gradual change envisaged, in order to\"avoid economic dislocation for EU fishermen that have traditionally fished in UK waters\".\n\nThe EU also wants to divide up the amounts that each country's boats are allowed to catch in a way that will not be renegotiated every year, and which cannot be changed unless both the UK and the EU agree.  \n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said in the past that annual negotiations with the UK would be technically impossible because so many different types of fish would be involved. \n\nBut that's what the UK has been pushing for. \n\nAccess to markets\n\nEither way, the UK will soon have control over who can fish in its waters.\n\nBut it's not just about where fish can be caught - it's also about where fish can be sold. \n\nThis is particularly important, because most of the fish landed by UK fishermen is exported (while most of the fish eaten in the UK is imported). \n\nAnd of all those exported fish, roughly three quarters are sold within the EU. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports and would collapse if they were suddenly faced with tariffs or taxes on their products. \n\nThat's one reason why the UK argues access to markets should be nothing to do with access to fishing waters. \n\nBut the EU is making the link explicit. Without a deal on fish, it insists, there will be no special access to the EU single market. And it's gone further, with some ministers saying that if the UK blocks access to fishing waters they can't guarantee full access to EU energy supplies.\n\nComplex negotiation\n\nPlenty of other fisheries' issues need to be taken into consideration, including:\n\nIt is a complex picture. \n\nBut it's worth remembering that fishing is only a tiny fraction of the overall economy both in the UK (less than 0.1%) and in the EU (some landlocked countries have no fishing fleets at all). \n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, fishing was worth \u00a3784m to the UK economy in 2018. By comparison, the financial services industry was worth \u00a3132bn. \n\n\n\n\u00a3784mcontribution of fishing to UK GDP\n\n\u00a3132,000mfrom financial services\n\nA sensitive issue \n\nIn many coastal communities though, fishing is a major source of employment - responsible for thousands of jobs. The industry still has political power, and both the UK and the EU are under pressure not to give ground. \n\nA final compromise is likely to involve the UK guaranteeing a certain level of access to EU boats, which is lower (but not that much lower) than they have now. \n\nFor its part, the EU will have to accept a larger quota share for the UK. Currently EU boats catch about \u00a3600m of fish in UK waters every year, and the UK wants more than half of that catch back. \n\nAny new deal on fishing would not come into full force for several years, but the two sides also differ on how long a status quo period should last.   \n\nSo, it remains a highly sensitive issue, and not just in the UK.\n\nIn France, for example, President Macron wants to win regions with big fishing communities in the next Presidential election in 2022. \n\nUltimately, any proposed deal on fishing needs the agreement of all EU countries - it can't just be signed off by the European Commission. \n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: Fishing has always been an emotional issue in the UK's relationship with the European Union, and it's no surprise that it is one of the final outstanding issues in the post-Brexit trade talks.\n\nArticle: The statistics also said 432 cyclists were seriously injured or killed on the roads in 2014 - the lowest level since records began.\n\nThe total number of cycling journeys rose by 5% to 610,000 a day - 23 million a year, TfL said.\n\nBoris Johnson welcomed the figures, but campaigners said the number of fatalities was\"unacceptably high\".\n\nThe mayor of London said:\"These figures are tremendously encouraging and will, I hope, give even more people the confidence to get on their bikes. \n\n\"Operation Safeway, which we made permanent feature last year, has already helped improve driver and cyclist behaviour.

Find a vantage point\n\n\"Set up the camera so it captures a wide arc of the horizon. Ideally you will want to capture lots of lightning strikes in one frame,\"says Coomes.\n\n\"You might want to include the landscape in the bottom part of the frame so the lighting has somewhere to go. It can work well if you have a night cityscape, for example.\"\n\n2. Use a low shutter speed\n\nCoomes says the most common mistake amateur photographers make is\"trying to take a picture when you see it\". \n\nInstead, he says, you should set up your camera ahead of the storm.\n\n\"What you really need is long exposure, allowing the shutter to remain open as the lightning lights up the sky,\"Coomes says.\n\nHe recommends experimenting with shutter speeds upwards of half a second.\n\n\"Depending on the intensity of the lightning, you can adjust your aperture and ISO settings to get the correct exposure,\"he adds.\n\nIf you're taking pictures on a phone, don't worry. \n\nSome more recent models allow you to manually change the camera settings. If yours does not, there are a number of apps designed to help you capture lightning strikes.\n\n3. Use a stable surface\n\n\"Steadying the camera is essential,\"Coomes says.\"People try to hand hold it, which you can't really do at that kind of exposure.\"\n\nUsing some sort of tripod, whether for your phone or camera, will help. You could even make your own.\n\n4. Stay safe\n\nLastly, Coomes says the most important thing is to stay safe.\n\n\"If the lightning starts landing around you - don't worry about taking a picture,\"he says.\n\nShare your images of the storms with us.

In 1997, Scottish GVA per hour was 94.8% of the UK average and in 2015 was 98.3%.\n\nSo why has Wales fallen behind?\n\nBy 1997 most of the structural change of the Welsh economy - the decline in coal and steel - had already taken place. Wales had enjoyed years of high levels of inward investment, particularly from Japanese manufacturers of consumer products, like TVs and microwaves, producing here to sell into the new European single market. \n\nRead more: Reality Check: Is Wales worse off after devolution?\n\n10 charts showing Wales since the devolution vote\n\nIt is hard to argue that the decline of traditional industries was the main reason that Wales fell behind in the last 20 years, although many communities were still ravaged by the effects of that.  \n\nThat was recognised by the European Union as it awarded Wales the highest level of economic aid, Objective One, in 2000, 2007 and for a third period again in 2014. \n\nSince 2000 an extra \u00a35.3bn has been injected into the Welsh economy from the EU beyond other sources of income like the block grant from Westminster.\n\nThe way in which the first tranche of EU aid was spent has been criticised by a number of academics and the Wales Audit Office for lacking economic and geographical focus.\n\nFor example every local authority seemed to be awarded its own new arts centre, among other things. \n\nBut bearing in mind the closeness of the vote in support of devolution perhaps that was the right approach politically, even if it was not the best option economically.\n\nThe new money from Brussels was also used to try to get more people into work through various training programmes and childcare schemes. \n\nEvidence suggests that nations and regions that choose a precise target for economic regeneration often succeed. \n\nIreland decided to go hook, line and sinker to attract technology firms, while the Basque country in Spain embraced radical urban planning and decided to stick with its traditional industries but modernise them through research and development. \n\nSo what has been the\"Big Idea\"for Wales in the last 20 years?\n\nWales scrapped government agencies in the so called\"Bonfire of the Quangos\"and gave voters free prescriptions and bus passes for older passengers. But those things do not in themselves make an economy vibrant.\n\nThe second and third tranches of EU regional aid have been characterised as working more closely with the private sector, but again without a single focus for the economy. Instead they have  instead a broad approach to increasing jobs and productivity.\n\nThere have been nine priority sectors for the economy. \n\nIt was difficult to identify an industry which did not fit into one of those. \n\nBut now Economy Secretary Ken Skates has announced that this number would be reduced to three as part of his new economic strategy.\n\nThere have also been industry-specific techniums to help business growth. Directing the private sector to work on certain sites does not seem to have been popular, with a few exceptions such as the Optic Centre at St Asaph.\n\nWhat certainly has been a major achievement for Wales, and which might not have been expected, is the halving of Welsh unemployment rates reducing it to the same as the UK average.\n\nIn 1997 unemployment in Wales was 7.2% while the UK was 6.6%. Now both are 4.3% That is no mean feat and something similar economic areas like the north east of England have not managed. \n\nBut at what cost? Low wages?\n\nComparing Wales and Scotland, in 1997 middle earners in both countries were paid \u00a3301 a week. In Wales, that now stands at \u00a3492 a week whereas in Scotland it is \u00a342 a week higher at \u00a3534.\n\nSimilarly, household incomes, which include benefits, pensions and investments, as a proportion of the UK average have risen in Scotland and fallen significantly in Wales.\n\nWith Scotland's oil and gas industries declining it is perhaps surprising that Scottish economy has performed so much better than Wales since devolution.\n\nWhat we do know is that the Scottish government has given considerable support to renewable energy and in particular onshore wind.  \n\nAnother contrast with Wales is that Scotland has retained its regional development agency Scottish Enterprise, whereas the Welsh Development Agency was scrapped in that quango cull. \n\nBut surely the answer to Scotland's success must lie in more than that? \n\nSo why hasn't Wales performed better? Critics of Welsh economic policies often argue that there has not been a single, finely-targeted, big idea and that economic policy has not changed significantly since the 1990s. \n\nOther approaches have been suggested by Welsh academics like Prof Calvin Jones, Dr Mark Lang and Prof Karel Williams and others. \n\nIt is worth noting that one of the most exciting economic developments in recent years is the compound semiconductor Catapault cluster and foundry in south east Wales. \n\nIt has been driven by the private sector, the Welsh firm IQE, and attracted significant investment and support from others in the private sector, Cardiff University, the Cardiff Capital Region as well as Welsh and UK governments. \n\nThat really does have the potential to change the economic landscape of Wales.  \n\nAny analysis of the Welsh economy since devolution needs to remember that without it, Wales would have had to deal with the full thrust of austerity. \n\nThe Welsh Government protected public services to some extent, and local authorities in Wales did not have to face budget cuts to the same extent as English ones. \n\nSimilarly the Welsh React and Proact programmes helped protect jobs and companies in Wales the as effect of the financial crisis of 2008 hit. Without those, and programmes like Jobs Growth Wales, the Welsh economy might well be in a poorer position now.\n\nWe must not ignore the fact that devolution gave tools to the Welsh Government to steer the economy to a certain extent but the big economic levers - setting income tax, interest rates and benefit levels - stayed with Westminster. \n\nThe challenge for Wales now is to learn from the past 20 years, use the tools it has, and be bold about the future.\nTL;DR: We have passed the milestone marking two decades of devolution in Wales. But do we feel better off?\n\nArticle: But on Sunday, she sparked backlash by sharing a photo of herself holding her two-year-old son, Theodore.\n\nSome Twitter users labelled the image\"offensive\", amid reports that hundreds of migrant children have been removed from their parents by US border agents.\n\nThe storm surrounding family separations by immigration authorities has been brewing for several months.\n\nMs Trump, who serves as an adviser to her father Donald Trump, has so far not responded to the criticism of the photo or the US government's stance on immigration.\n\nShe has previously said she would not\"undermine\"the current administration by publicly voicing her disagreement with the administration's policies.\n\nWhat prompted the current outcry?\n\nDiscussion has grown on social media in recent days following the publication of a number of significant reports into the treatment of child migrants.\n\nA report released on 23 May by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alleged that US Customs and Border Protection agents abused and neglected dozens of unaccompanied migrant children in their custody between 2009 and 2014, under the administration of former President Barack Obama.\n\nIn March, the ACLU launched a class action lawsuit against a number of government agencies and immigration officials over what it described as the\"unlawful practice\"of removing children from their families when there was no indication that they would be at risk of harm by staying.\n\nMore on Trump and immigration\n\nThe following month, the New York Times reported that about 700 children - including 100 under the age of four - had been separated from the adults they were travelling with after entering the US.\n\nAbout the same time, a senior official told a Senate committee that the authorities were unable to contact almost 1,500 unaccompanied minors who had been placed in the care of sponsors in the US, adding that under current legislation the government bore no legal responsibility for the missing children.\n\nIt is not the first time that US procedures for dealing with child migrants have come under criticism. In 2015 it emerged that a group of minors from Guatemala had been contracted into forced labour after being placed with sponsors by the government.\n\nWhat are social media users saying?\n\nEven before Ivanka Trump posted the image of her son, anger had been growing about the plight of children arriving in the US, with the hashtag #Wherearethechildren used over 800,000 times on Twitter.\n\nSome social media users appear to have conflated the figures of unaccompanied minors and those who had been separated from their parents, but the outcry remains significant.\n\nCritics attacked the timing of Ms Trump's post on Sunday, and used it to draw attention to anger over separated and missing children. \n\nOne of the most liked responses said that\"an actual mother would have compassion for the children harmed by your father's policies\", while other users commented that the image appeared to be staged.\n\nSome are now calling for a march in cities across the US on 14 June.\n\nHowever, not everyone linked the post to the debate on immigration, with some praising its beauty.\n\nWhat has the government's response been?\n\nPresident Trump has himself spoken out against separating migrant children from their families. \n\nHe has incorrectly blamed the Democrats for the practice, saying:\"We have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law. It's a horrible thing where you have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law and they don't want to do anything about it.\"\n\nA\"fact check\"by the Associated Press instead found that the decision to separate families was made by the Trump administration.\n\nSenior members of Mr Trump's administration have indicated that separating families could act as a deterrent for illegal migration. Under previous protocol, parents and their children have been either detained or released together, pending asylum or immigration hearings.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told CNN in March that he was considering separating families at the border to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in early May that anyone found crossing the border illegally would be prosecuted and face possible separation from their children.\n\n\"If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you, and that child may be separated from you as required by law... If you don't want your child to be separated, then don't bring them across the border illegally,\"Mr Sessions said.\n\nUntil now, those crossing the border illegally for the first time have been charged with a misdemeanour, punishable by a fine and/or a prison sentence of up to six months, before facing deportation.\nTL;DR: As the daughter of one of America's most divisive presidents, Ivanka Trump is no stranger to controversy.\n\nArticle: Emergency services were called to the eastbound carriageway between Margam, near Port Talbot, and Pyle, near Bridgend, after the alert was raised just after 12:30 GMT on Sunday.\n\nSix people were taken to hospital, but none of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening.\n\nFirefighters were then called to two other crashes nearby within 45 minutes.\n\nNobody was hurt in these two later crashes, when two cars left the road.\n\nInitial reports from the emergency services said the first collision saw eight people hurt and five cars involved, but those figures were later updated to 11 casualties and four vehicles.\n\nSlowed down to look\n\nSouth Wales Fire and Rescue Service said they were called for help by colleagues from the Mid and West Service shortly after the area was hit by a large hailstorm.\n\nSouth Wales Police said they received\"multiple reports\"of the first crash.\n\nTraffic on the opposing westbound carriageway was also affected as drivers slowed down to look, they said.\n\nIn the second crash, about 20 minutes later, a car crashed down an embankment on the westbound side between Junction 34 at Miskin and Junction 35 at Pencoed. \n\nThe driver was out when emergency services arrived.\n\nThen about 20 minutes after that police and fire crews were called to the westbound lane between Junction 36 at Sarn and Junction 37 at Pyle, where a car had gone in to trees.\nTL;DR: Eleven people have been injured after a four-car crash on the M4 in south Wales shortly after a hailstorm.\n\nArticle: By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter\n\nKSI or Logan Paul?\n\nYouTube fans around the world have chosen whose side they are on, and will be watching when the pair of social media heavyweights step into the ring at Manchester Arena.\n\nBoth are wildly popular, both are massively divisive, both have highly controversial pasts.\n\nWho are KSI and Logan Paul?\n\nKSI is the brash 25-year-old British gamer, comedy vlogger and rapper whose videos have racked up 4.4 billion views despite heavy criticism for lewd comments towards women in some of his clips.\n\nLogan Paul is the 23-year-old US prankster (and former state wrestler) who made his name on Vine before moving to YouTube, where he's had 3.9 billion views, and who caused outrage earlier this year for showing the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan.\n\nBoth have cultivated a frenzied online feud in order to hype up this bout, which will be streamed pay-per-view on YouTube.\n\nTheir brothers Jake Paul (4.9 billion views) and Deji (3.3 billion) will fight on the undercard. \n\nA chance for redemption? What KSI and Logan say\n\nBoth seem to have largely shrugged off their controversies, but the fight will be seen by some as a way to prop up, and cash in on, their careers.\n\nAsked by BBC News whether he's hoping to redeem himself, Logan says:\"I don't think this is the redemption. I think it may mark a part of it, but by no means is this fight a redemption for my mistake that happened in January.\n\n\"But I think it is an opportunity to for me to have taken a step back from the internet and focus my efforts elsewhere, and it's an opportunity for me to show the world a new version of Logan Paul, not just silly internet vlog boy.\"\n\nKSI, when asked whether he has regrets about his past behaviour, tells BBC News:\"I definitely have regrets for some of the things I've said and done, but you know, I'm a human being and human beings make mistakes.\n\n\"Because it's me, it's showcased all over the internet, but that's just how it is.\"\n\nWhat the fans are saying\n\nSocial media can be a combative place, so perhaps it's logical for social superstars to take their hostility a into the real world.\n\nAt one of KSI's training sessions in Manchester before the fight, fan Shaf Miah, 25, from London, says the white-collar amateur bout is\"the next level of internet beef\". \n\nHe says:\"If you read comments [on YouTube], people want to physically hit someone if they don't like them or if they've done something annoying. And to see their favourite YouTuber do it for them, they're obviously going to pay money to watch it.\"\n\nMichael Zepeda, 21, has come from LA for the fight.\"They've both got a lot of subscribers, they both get a lot of views,\"he says.\"Everybody wants to watch.\n\n\"I want to see Logan get his ass beat. He deserves it. He's done many messed up things for views. He crossed that line, definitely.\"\n\nCJ Melia, 21, has travelled to Manchester from Dublin.\"I cannot wait,\"he says.\"I'm so excited for this. I've been watching KSI for about nine years. He's the reason I started my first YouTube channel eight years ago.\n\n\"I never thought something like this would happen. This is the biggest event YouTube has ever done.\"\n\nWhat the pros are saying\n\nHow the bout came about\n\nThis all started when two other YouTubers - Joe Weller and Theo Baker, AKA Malfoy - went into the ring last year, and KSI said he would fight the winner. \n\nKSI took on Weller at the Copper Box Arena in London in February, and won. That was streamed live on YouTube for free, with 1.8 million people watching live and 36 million more watching on the pair's official channels since.\n\nWeller has five million subscribers to Logan Paul's 18 million. Saturday's fight will be much bigger - but this time, punters have to pay \u00a37.50 to watch.\n\nThe biggest event in internet history?\n\nReally?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge might have something to say about that. Their 2011 wedding holds the Guinness World Record for the most live streams for a single event, at 72 million - although that obviously wasn't a product of the online world, as this fight is.\n\nYouTuber Jordan Antle, who goes by the name TheFearRaiser, says the fight's billing is not over the top.\"This is a massive event and I would definitely say this is going to be one of the biggest internet events so far in history,\"he tells BBC News.\n\n\"Seeing two YouTubers who have a large fanbase fighting each other live in front of millions of people in unheard of. It's a very strange combination of two worlds and it's attracting a lot of attention because of how different it is.\"\n\nKSI and the Paul brothers have certainly been doing their best to whip their fans into a frenzy.\n\nInsult-filled videos and diss tracks have flown back and forth, and ill-tempered press conferences have taken place in Los Angeles and London.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Deji turned up unannounced at the Pauls' training gym in Manchester and ended up getting a slap from Jake.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nIs it for real?\n\nThe antics have all been more WWE than WBO. But KSI's manager Liam Chivers insists it's\"100% real\".\n\nHe says:\"People think these guys are not professional boxers, this is just a bit of fun, it's just an amateur fight.\n\n\"No - these two guys are on an absolute pedestal and they have egos, they have hugely passionate audiences.\n\n\"This is the modern-day mainstream of fandom, this is where the pressure is at, and these two guys have built their reputations and audiences over however many years, and it's all on the line.\n\n\"Plus the fact they're promotional geniuses and they've applied that and have attacked each other so hard that they are really very upset with each other. There's not one little bit of fake beef about it.\"\n\nHow many people will watch?\n\nMore than 15,000 tickets have been sold for Manchester Arena, but Chivers is reluctant to predict how many people will sign up to watch online.\n\n\"It's really hard to know - this is the first time this has ever been done,\"he says.\"If you said a number of a couple of hundred thousand buys, I'd say that was not good but that would cover costs.\"\n\nThe fight will cost \u00a37.50 to watch in the UK or $10 in the US - much less than a big professional pay-per-view fight, but much more than people are used to paying on YouTube.\n\n\"There's a YouTube culture of not buying and it's a whole educational process to see how many tune in,\"Chivers says.\n\nTaking part in high-profile real-life contests is nothing new for YouTubers - although, with Zoella on The Great Comic Relief Bake-Off in 2015 and her brother Joe Sugg in this year's Strictly Come Dancing, other British examples have been more sedate.\n\nSo with their attention-grabbing aggression, KSI and Logan Paul have stumbled across an effective way to boost their profiles and bank balances, and other YouTubers may follow suit.\n\nNo matter who wins bragging rights in Manchester - and the victor will brag a lot - the pair have already agreed to a rematch in the US.

It is a naked power grab which would cripple devolution.\"\n\nThe Taoiseach (Ireland's prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin has spoken to Mr Johnson\"in forthright terms\"about\"the breach of an international treaty, the absence of bilateral engagement and the serious implications for Northern Ireland\", the Irish government said.\n\n'Challenging circumstances'\n\nCabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will hold emergency talks in London on Thursday with EU Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to discuss the contents of the bill. \n\nThe European Commission had requested a meeting as soon as possible to clarify what the legislation means for the Brexit deal. \n\nMeanwhile, the latest scheduled round of negotiations on securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU are also due to wrap up on Thursday. \n\nCommission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted:\"Very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the Withdrawal Agreement. This would break international law and undermines trust.\"\n\nDowning Street said the EU Withdrawal Agreement - repeatedly described as\"oven ready\"by Mr Johnson during last year's general election - contained\"ambiguities\"and lacked clarity in\"key areas\".\n\nThe PM's spokesman said it had been agreed\"at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances\"to\"deliver on a decision by the British people\".\n\nIt had been signed\"on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached\", the spokesman added.\n\nRemit of the bill\n\nThe new bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January.\n\nIt proposes:\n\nThe bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law.\n\nMinisters say the legislation is needed to prevent\"damaging\"tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.\n\n'Beyond price'\n\nBut senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sir John Major said:\"For generations, Britain's word - solemnly given - has been accepted by friend and foe. Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct.\"\n\nHe added:\"If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained.\"\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider\"the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward\".\n\nBut Sir Keir - who campaigned for a second Brexit referendum - added that the\"way forward\"now was to get a trade deal, adding\"if you fail to get a deal, prime minister, you own that failure\".\n\n\"The outstanding issues are not difficult. They can be resolved. So what I say to the prime minister is, you promised a good deal, get on, negotiate it,\"he added. \n\n\"That's what's in the national interest and focus then on the issue in hand which is tackling this pandemic.\"\n\nIn the withdrawal agreement with the EU, Northern Ireland is still in the UK, but it has to follow elements of the EU's customs code.\n\nThis bill will be seen by the EU as a pretty brazen attempt to override the deal that has been done.\n\nThe bill contains the words\"notwithstanding\"- that basically means this law sets aside a law we have already agreed.\n\nThat was described to me earlier in the week as being a completely nuclear option.\n\nAnd they have pressed it.\n\nThis row isn't going to go away.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, which has been pressing for changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, said the bill was a\"step forward\"but the government must ensure Northern Ireland is not\"restrained in a state aid straight jacket unlike the rest of the UK\".\n\nBut the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's Michelle O' Neill, said the Withdrawal Agreement protected the Good Friday Agreement and it was\"astounding\"the UK government\"thinks its fine\"to wreck an international treaty they had signed up to.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said:\"My job is to uphold the integrity of the UK but also to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. \n\n\"And to do that, we need a legal safety net to protect our country against extreme or irrational interpretations of the Protocol, which could lead to a border down the Irish Sea, in a way that I believe would be prejudicial to the interests of the Good Friday Agreement and prejudicial to the interests of peace in our country. And that has to be our priority.\"\n\nCommenting on a similar argument by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, a former minister told the BBC:\"I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite.\"\n\nThe legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level.\n\nIt will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade.\n\nThe Scottish government fears the UK single market will cut across areas that are usually devolved.\n\nFor example, if the UK government decides some food imports are acceptable in England then they would also be allowed in Scotland, even though agriculture is devolved.\n\n'Rogue state'\n\nThe new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge.\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, described the Internal Markets Bill as\"nothing short of an attack on Scotland's parliament and an affront to people of Scotland\".\n\nMr Johnson said the bill would protect jobs and growth - and was a\"massive devolutionary act\"that would represent a\"very substantial transfer of power and sovereignty\"to Scotland and Wales.\n\nBut his words did not prevent the resignation of a senior Conservative in Wales, where the party is in opposition.\n\nDavid Melding, shadow Counsel General, said in his resignation letter that the PM's actions in the past few days had\"gravely aggravated\"the dangers facing\"our 313-year-old Union\".\nTL;DR: Boris Johnson has urged MPs to support a bill which modifies the Brexit

The work included demolition of a wall and site clearance, and continued from 29 June to 3 July, according to the representative of Mr Shorrock.\n\nBut a letter from Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng to the developers made it clear the UK government still considered the DCO to have expired, despite the developer's claims.\n\nBefore work could begin, a plan on how the scheme would be dismantled - or decommissioned - was required by UK government. \n\nMr Kwarteng wrote that developers submitted that plan in May, just two months before the expiry date.\n\n\"As the [decommissioning] programme was submitted so close to the DCO expiry date and, following examination, was not in a suitable state to recommend approval, the DCO expired.\"\n\nCiting the statement from Tidal Power about the work, he said the department's position\"remains clear\".\n\nThe local authority, Swansea, said in June that the work was\"unlawful\"as it failed to meet\"the requirements of the Development Consent Order which need to be complied [with] before development commences\".\n\nA Swansea Council spokesman said:\"The council continues to take independent legal advice on this matter. \n\n\"We wrote to Tidal Power PLC on 8 July to confirm that the development consent order had expired because the company had failed to meet its requirements within the five-year timescale set out in the DCO. \n\n\"As the DCO has lapsed, no part of the previously authorised development may now proceed in the absence of further order or other consent. \n\n\"The council is monitoring the situation on site and will take appropriate action should that be necessary.\"\n\n'Not a good deal for consumers'\n\nUnder new laws in 2017, any further order to develop the project would now need to be obtained from the Welsh Government. \n\nThe Welsh Government said no such application to extend the DCO was made by Tidal Lagoon Power before the 30 June permission expiry date. \n\nA UK government spokesperson said:\"We will continue to explore marine technologies that harness the natural energy of our tides and offshore wind, but any proposed project must provide value for money for the consumer. \n\n\"Following extensive analysis, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project did not meet this criteria as it would not have delivered a good deal for consumers. \n\n\"However we will continue to examine more cost-effective projects to create green jobs and reach net zero emissions by 2050.\"\n\nAnalysis by Ione Wells, BBC Wales Westminster correspondent\n\nOn 22 June, Tidal Power promoted the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon as one of the'shovel-ready projects' that could get the economy going post-coronavirus. \n\nBut it was not ready to shovel anything in the eyes of the UK government.\n\nIt, and Swansea Council, have been clear the company failed to meet its requirements within the five-year timescale set out by their planning permission. That is why the permission expired. \n\nThis is directly at odds with what the company claim, which is that - because they did some site clearing work the day before the permission expired - their permission now lasts\"in perpetuity\". In other words, indefinitely. \n\nWhat is not clear yet is what changed between 22 June, when the company said they needed their decommissioning plans approved by the UK government to begin work, and 29 June when that work actually did begin. \n\nNor is it clear what plans they have now that the council has said action could be taken against them if any part of the development continues without gaining further permission from the Welsh Government.\nTL;DR: Developers behind the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon no longer have planning permission to build the project, the UK government has said.\n\nArticle: The Essex newcomer has been forced to postpone her biggest headline gig to date at London's Scala (7 December). \n\nWriting to her followers on Twitter, J thanked fans for their support saying:\"I am very weak and in hospital resting.\"\n\nHer record company has asked fans to hold on to their tickets. \n\nA scheduled show set to take place at Brighton's Coalition on 11 December currently remains unaffected. \n\nThis week the 22-year-old singer was included on the BBC's Sound Of 2011 long-list, tipping next year's most exciting new musical talent.\nTL;DR: Singer Jessie J, who recently scored a top 30 hit with her debut track Do It Like A Dude, has been admitted to hospital with a \"severe virus\".\n\nArticle: The blaze began shortly before 19:00 GMT on Friday and caused severe damage to a disused office.\n\nIn December, a lorry was driven into the same complex, leaving a gaping hole in a building. \n\nThere have been a number of attacks on Quinn Group property since new management took over the company last year.\n\nFermanagh businessman Sean Quinn who lost control of the company has condemned previous attacks.\n\nHe said those responsible for the damage were not acting in his name and he called for them to stop.\nTL;DR: A fire at the Quinn Group headquarters near Derrylin in County Fermanagh is being treated as suspicious.\n\nArticle: The singer said he turned to the file-sharing system as\"an experiment\".\n\nTomorrow's Modern Boxes, which includes eight tracks and a video, is available for $6 (\u00a33.68).\n\nIt comes seven years after Radiohead famously shook up the music business by giving their album In Rainbows a\"pay what you want\"online release.\n\nIn a statement, Yorke and producer Nigel Godrich said:\"It's an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around...\n\n\"If it works well it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work.\n\n\"Enabling those people who make either music, video or any other kind of digital content to sell it themselves.

I wrote before about how most of these issues are linked to the world economy in any case.\n\nBut, where they have delivered less is with respect to concrete commitments on those issues. \n\nFor instance, the gist of the G20 statement on climate and Ebola is that they are concerned, and support effective action - without committing money or quantitative targets. Maybe that's too much to expect given that these originally weren't on the agenda.\n\nFighting tax evasion was on the agenda, and the G20 agreed to automatically share tax information, but I've already heard criticism from Transparency International and others that it doesn't go far enough because the information won't be in the public domain.\n\nGoing for growth\n\nOf course, economic growth was top of the agenda, and is, as expected, the main focus of the G20 statement.\n\nWorld leaders reaffirmed their goal of lifting the GDP of G20 economies - which represent 85% of the world's economy - by an additional 2% within four years, by 2018. It's equivalent to adding $2 trillion to global output, and they say that will create millions of jobs. \n\nHow they can achieve that, of course, is the big question.\n\nThe statement says that they'll deliver jobs through increasing\"investment, trade and competition\". \n\nEach country will have their own plans, but the mechanisms outlined include getting another 100 million women into the workforce, increasing trade, and setting up a Global Infrastructure Hub. \n\nWhat is notable is a focus on youth unemployment, with details to come next year. They also emphasised a commitment to poverty eradication and reducing inequality, which are certainly important.\n\nWho's paying is, of course, key. \n\nMy understanding is that private businesses are being targeted for investment funds in infrastructure, for instance. We'll see more detail soon enough when individual countries work through their country plans in the coming months.\n\nJobless recovery\n\nRaising global growth by 2% has been an aim of the G20 all year, and in prior years in various forms, yet the eurozone economy is teetering and emerging markets such as China and Brazil have been slowing. So, another statement may ring a bit hollow. \n\nOn the other hand, it's unclear what co-ordinated action could be taken since it's not 2008/09 where governments and central banks were jointly acting to save the global financial system. \n\nI'm told that countries will monitor each other's actions to ensure that there's no negative impact on others. That may be what's realistic, but also it is also unsatisfying to those who have been waiting for their governments to do more jointly to create jobs.\n\nAfter all, how to address the so-called jobless recovery, where output has recovered but employment has not, is a key issue in a number of major economies. Perhaps when the G20's employment working group reports back in 2015, there will be more detail.\n\nHowever, if it takes until November in 2015 at the G20 in Turkey to see specific policies to address the jobless recovery that has been with us for more than six years, taxpayers may begin to balk at paying for these big summits that promise much but tend to deliver somewhat less.\nTL;DR: The G20 summit of world leaders has concluded with a communique, a fancy way of describing a joint statement, that has both delivered more, but also somewhat less, than expected.\n\nArticle: By Mark SimpsonBBC News NI \n\nThe MP's political opponents have been quick to seize upon her admission about how little she knew about Northern Ireland before getting the job.\n\nAt the same time, her supporters have been defending her, with one Conservative councillor saying she would make a good Tory leader one day.\n\nStaffordshire county councillor Ian Lawson, from Biddulph, says Mrs Bradley is\"prime ministerial material\".\n\n\"She's honest, and you don't get many of them at Westminster, do you?\"he added.\n\nThe secretary of state hit the headlines earlier this month after admitting she previously did not understand that\"people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa\".\n\n'Foolish'\n\nIt led to her being ridiculed in some quarters, but in her Staffordshire Moorlands constituency she has been defended in a local newspaper editorial. \n\n\"It's not hard to feel sorry for her,\"stated the Chronicle.\n\n\"Anyone who claims to actually understand Irish politics is possibly equally foolish.\"\n\nHowever, Labour councillor Jill Salt has no sympathy.\n\n\"I'm a teacher and I teach Northern Ireland politics to my students and I was astonished that she didn't realise that they voted on partisan lines,\"she said. \n\n\"And I was also astonished that she admitted that.\"\n\nAnother Labour councillor, Bill Cawley, wrote a letter to the Leek Post and Times.\n\n\"You would expect some knowledge of the province or at least not to be so gauche as to proclaim your ignorance,\"he wrote.\n\nMrs Bradley was appointed secretary of state for Northern Ireland in January, after previously being culture secretary.\n\n'Down to earth'\n\nShe has been an MP since 2010, after winning the Staffordshire Moorlands seat formerly held by Labour for more than a decade.\n\nShe grew up nearby in the Derbyshire town Buxton, where her parents owned a pub.\n\nNow married with two sons, she is a chartered accountant and worked for Deloitte & Touche and KPMG before entering parliament.\n\nThe fact that she had a career outside politics before becoming an MP is one of her strengths, according to local businessman Jon Eeles, who is the chairman of Leek Town football club.\n\n\"She's very down to earth,\"he says.\n\n\"As a chartered accountant in the Cabinet, one of the few, she has a different view than some of them. \n\n\"I have quite a dim view of politicians, because they are career politicians and have never worked in the real world. Karen is different.\"\n\nUnlike some MPs, she is not high-profile on social media. In terms of TV and radio, her media appearances are limited.\n\n'Too honest'\n\nShe writes a regular local newspaper column but it tends not to be controversial or outspoken.\n\nFor example, her latest column is about a recent garden party she hosted at Hillsborough Castle.\n\n\"It was lovely to be able to show everyone what a very special place I reside in when I am in Northern Ireland,\"she wrote.\n\nEven though her job as secretary of state is across the Irish Sea, it is clear that what she does there is being watched 200 miles away, back in her constituency.\n\n\"I think in the end, she will get the job done,\"says fellow Tory councillor Lawson.\n\nHe added:\"I would say her only fault is that she is too honest. She says what she thinks.\"\n\nAt the next election, Mrs Bradley will be defending a majority of more than 10,000 votes.\n\nShe is likely to be judged more on her success as a local MP rather than her Cabinet role.\n\nIn the end, Biddulph will be more important than Belfast.\nTL;DR: From Belfast to Buxton to Biddulph, the performance of Karen Bradley as secretary of state for Northern Ireland is being watched with interest.\n\nArticle: Shortly after competing at the National Eisteddfod in 1915, the entire choir of the 17th battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers from Wrexham headed to the trenches to fight. \n\nTwo years later, when they were invited to sing again, only the conductor was still alive to take the stage.\n\nThe\"lost choir\"has inspired the production Dinner With Otto.\n\nAlmost the entire choir was from the village of Rhosllanerchrugog but within two years had been virtually wiped out.\n\nConductor Lance-Corporal Samuel Evans was the only surviving member when the choir returned to the eisteddfod in Birkenhead in 1917.\n\nAt the same eisteddfod, the poet Hedd Wyn, from Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, was honoured posthumously and the bardic chair was draped in black, after he was killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele.\n\nNewspapers at the time, the Amman Valley Chronicle and East Carmarthenshire News of 13 September 1917, which reported on the chairing ceremony, wrote:\"Even more tragic and pathetic was the second scene when the conductor called to the platform was a wounded Welsh soldier, Lance-Corporal Samuel Evans, Rhos.\n\n\"Every one of these gallant fellows, musical sons of Wales, with the single exception of the conductor, had rendered the supreme sacrifice for his country.\"\n\nThe men, who came to be known as the Lost Choir, inspired local playwright Tom George Caroll, from Holywell.\n\nHe said:\"It was important to me to make my play as realistic as possible, so I undertook extensive research on events of the time, the lives of soldiers returning to north Wales, the expectations made of them and experiences they went through.\n\n\"It's a tough watch but compelling.\"\n\nHe added while the story is based on real life, it is fictional, and about a rugby team where only one player came back to a small village in Wales.\n\nThe character, Ben Davies, has\"shell shock\"and his mother finds him completely changed, alcoholic and traumatised on his return.

The figure for writing in 2011, based on externally marked test results, was 75%.  \n\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said figures from a representative sample of pupils taking an externally marked writing test in 2012 showed 77% of pupils met the expected level. \n\nThe spokesman added:\"This suggests that there would have been a gap between test and teacher assessment outcomes for all pupils at national level.   \n\n\"Some difference between test and teacher assessment results can be expected as the outcomes are measured in different ways. A teacher assessment is the teacher's judgement of a pupil's performance across the curriculum and the academic year, whereas the tests assess a sample of the curriculum for specific pupils on the day of the tests.\n\n\"As no information on writing teacher assessment is available for previous years and the writing sample test results are not directly comparable to test arrangements in previous years, the evidence for a real increase in attainment in writing is less strong.\"\n\nThis year the combined reading and writing scores gave an overall English score of 85% of Year 6 pupils reaching the expected level. \n\nThe proportion of pupils achieving above the expected level also rose. The percentage gaining level five or above in reading rose from 43% to 48% and in maths from 35% to 39%. \n\nGirls and boys did equally well in maths but girls continued to outperform boys in reading, with 90% of girls as opposed to 84% of boys achieving level four or above. \n\nMinister for Education and Childcare Elizabeth Truss said:\"I congratulate pupils, teachers and families on their hard work and achievements. The government is committed to driving up standards by giving teachers more freedom, strengthening discipline and improving teacher quality.\"\n\nChristine Blower of the National Union of Teachers commented:\"The improvements in pupils' reading and maths results are a credit to the hard work of teachers and pupils in Year 6 and throughout the primary sector.  \n\n\"Pupils clearly have well-honed skills in reading for meaning and let us hope pleasure as well. Unfortunately, pupils lower down the primary system, being drilled for the Year One Phonics Screening Check, may be less proficient in these skills as they move through the school and the pressure to'decode' text outweighs understanding. \n\n\"The increased scores in writing, through the use of teacher assessment this year, have proven that it is a more accurate and fair way of assessing pupils' ability. The NUT has long called for national curriculum tests at Key Stage 2 to be scrapped and replaced by teacher assessment which, when moderated well, is as robust an indicator of pupil achievement and progress as the current tests.\"    \n\nHead of the Nasuwt teaching union, Chris Keates, said:\"These results also confirm that the claims of those who continue to be fixated with running down the state education system and decrying its successes are doing so entirely without foundation.\n\n\"It is important to put today's figures into context. For example, in mathematics only 49% of pupils in 1995 achieved Level 4 or above at the end of their primary education.\"\nTL;DR: The proportion of 11-year-olds in England reaching the expected level in reading and maths has gone up, official figures show.\n\nArticle: In her first broadcast interview since resigning, Ms Lamont said the scale of the party's election defeat was worse than anyone\"possibly imagined\".\n\nThe party must now elect a leader\"for the long haul\"to recover, she said.\n\nMs Lamont also praised the SNP and its leader Nicola Sturgeon for running a campaign that\"got everything right\".\n\nThe SNP won 56 out of 59 seats in Scotland in last month's general election. \n\nLabour was left with just one MP in Scotland, after losing 40 seats, including those of Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.\n\n'No ploys, no gimmicks'\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johann Lamont, who led Scottish Labour from 2011 to 2014, said:\"Even those of us who were preparing for the worst possible defeat couldn't possibly have imagined what happened. \n\n\"We couldn't have predicted it, but we need to analyse it if we're going to survive.\n\n\"The instinct of the Labour Party is if there's a problem, change the leader, then sit back, fold your arms and wait to be disappointed because they're sure it's not going to deliver. \n\n\"We can't do that this time.

government believes bills applying exclusively to England should not become law without the explicit consent of MPs from English constituencies and it wants to change Commons rules known as standing orders to give them a\"decisive say\"during their passage.\n\nThe plan had been for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs.\n\nMinisters say this will address the long-standing anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and

occasion we have been wrong,\"the managing director said earlier this month.\n\nForecasts are just that, after all - forecasts.\n\nBut, she continued, when it comes to the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union,\"We can't see anything that is positive.\"\n\nIt is a similar story today with the Treasury's\"short-term\"economic impact report on what government economists believe would be the effect on the economy if voters plumped for Leave on 23 June.\n\nYes, forecasts can be wrong, but, using well-tested economic models, it is the Treasury's analysis that the downsides far outweigh any benefits.\n\nAnd, to be accurate, this is actually a\"gap analysis\", rather than a forecast - that is, it is a judgement on the difference in economic activity between two comparable scenarios (Remain and Leave).\n\nSuch gap studies are widely viewed by economists to be at the more robust end of modelling tolerances.\n\nThe model used is known as a vector auto-regression, which has been used here to look at the effect of\"uncertainty\"on issues such as business investment and household borrowing on economic performance.\n\nThat is then allied to a\"gravity model\", which judges the trading relationship between nations and the effect those relationships have on growth.\n\nThe more uncertainty there is and the more barriers that are thrown up to free trade, the more negative the impact, the model suggests.\n\nThe government believes that the UK would not be able to gain better access to the EU if it were outside the union and more specifically, the single market.\n\nIt also says that uncertainty would fundamentally undermine investment.\n\nIn that assessment, it finds allies in the IMF, the Bank of England, the London School of Economics and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\nIt should be pointed out that all use similar models, or indeed the same model, to test the figures.\n\nThe Leave campaign is quite right to point out that models can be wrong, as they were ahead of the UK's expulsion from the exchange rate mechanism.\n\nThen, the models suggested that growth would collapse, unemployment would rise and inflation would spike.\n\nIn the event, the UK economy did suffer a shock, but it wasn't of the calamitous variety.\n\nIt was of the\"shot in the arm\"variety - Britain is a relatively deregulated and open economy - and marked the start of nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth.\n\nCampaigners for Leave believe the same could be true of leaving the EU, which would, according to supportive economists, mean cheaper food and manufactured goods, to give one example.\n\nThat's because Britain would be outside what Prof Patrick Minford, of Cardiff University, describes as the\"customs union\"- the tariffs the EU imposes on goods coming into the single market.\n\nBetter free trade agreements could also be signed, Prof Minford believes, with countries which are becoming more and more important for British exports, such as the US and China.\n\nThere are many genuine economic disagreements between Remain and Leave, often based on legitimate points of view held by serious economists.\n\nCertainly, the weight of economic opinion as expressed by leading organisations, as I have said before, is in favour of Remain.\n\nAnd Prof Sir Charles Bean, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, describes today's Treasury's document as\"reasonable\".\n\nSometimes this debate can feel a little like\"my plague of frogs is worse than your plague of frogs\".\n\nAnd we could all be forgiven for becoming a little fed up with politicians shouting at each other, particularly when they claim, as the prime minister did today, that\"this is what happens\"to the economy, without a nod to\"coulds\"or\"maybes\".\n\nThese are forecasts, not definitive outcomes.\n\nBut, political hubris to one side, today's Treasury analysis can be set apart from the\"he said, she said\"tenor of much of the EU referendum debate.\n\nIt is based on a well understood and tested economic model.\n\nIt might be wrong, or the outcomes might be substantially different once real events take hold - as is true of all forecasts - but it is very much worth the paper it is written on.\nTL;DR: When I asked Christine Lagarde about the fact that the International Monetary Fund had been

Lowe says that, on one recent day, she clicked on 15 different songs - and each was preceded by a Conservative advert.\n\n\"It was like I was going mad,\"Lowe told BBC Trending.\"It was like I was trapped in some kind of Tory Groundhog Day.\"\n\nYouTube adverts appear to be a one big component of the Conservatives' digital campaign. But there is evidence to suggest that the political parties are not able to target YouTube users with much precision. \n\nAlong with BBC Newsnight and local radio, Trending has crowdsourced more than 500 political adverts across social media platforms. On Facebook, we've reported on the big money campaigns of the major political parties, and the self-funded efforts of grassroots groups. But a lot of ads are served up on other platforms too - with YouTube being the biggest - and in recent days we've noticed curious things about how broadly these are being'served' to audiences.\n\nJames McAteer was watching WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) videos on his laptop when he saw a Conservative advert criticising Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. This advert has gone viral online - perhaps boosted by paid-for advertising - but McAteer was taken aback when he was shown it on YouTube. \n\n\"I knew that the political parties were advertising on social media, but it didn't seem appropriate for me to see this advert,\"he says.\"When political ads are shown in a party political broadcast on TV we are told what it is and I can choose to watch or not. With this type of ad I have little or no choice to listen or watch.\"\n\nThis type of apparently general advertising differs from the highly targeted Facebook campaigns coming from the major parties, who have made use of data collected by the social network, including age, location and political views - which can be either provided by Facebook users, or deciphered from their\"likes\". For instance, the Conservative Party has targeted voters in key constituencies with anti-Jeremy Corbyn ads. \n\nOn YouTube, things are different. Viewers, listeners and readers have reported that they've seen Conservative YouTube ads in some of the safest Labour seats in the country, and many people unlikely to vote Tory have also been served the ads. \n\nChris Evans was chatting to his 10-year-old son about the upcoming general election, when his son firmly responded that he did not support Corbyn because of the Labour leader's stance on NATO. \n\nEvans, a member of the public who sent us the advert, was surprised by this mature contribution. However, when he pressed his son on the source of this information - presuming he'd overheard a teacher or a school friend - he found that his son's anti-Corbyn attitude had in fact been shaped by Conservative adverts on YouTube.\n\n\"Frankly, I was shocked - as perhaps I was naively unaware of political advertising on YouTube,\"he told Trending.\"As he rarely watches TV, the internet is now a primary source of information. The problem is, these ads are not the subject of balanced debate and argument.\"\n\nBut not all voters share such concerns. Another person who sent us an ad, Mike Quinn, saw a Conservative advert on YouTube while he was watching guitar pedal demonstration videos. He doesn't see much difference between traditional ads and social media campaigning.\"In principle, YouTube advertising is no different to the old-school loudspeaker vans that used to go around the streets urging us to'Vote for the Labour Party' or party political broadcasts,\"he told Trending. \n\nPaid-for political advertising on TV is banned in the UK, but the Electoral Commission told Trending that there are no specific laws regulating the output of political advertising on YouTube or any other social network.\"The political parties just have to report their total YouTube and social media spending to the Electoral Commission after the election,\"a spokesperson said. \n\nPolitical adverts on social media are also less visible than traditional forms of advertising, such as billboards, because social media ads generally can only be seen by those individuals who receive them. \n\nMore on political advertising from BBC Trending\n\nMeet the'micro-Pacs' buying political ads on Facebook\n\nThe rise of Tory attack ads on Facebook\n\nFilter Bubble Britain: General Election coverage from BBC Trending\n\nElection 2017: How can you pop your filter bubble?\n\nA Tory walks into an SNP bar...\n\nPro-Brexit Facebook groups: Conservative converts?\n\nIn addition to YouTube, the Conservatives seem to be expanding their advertising footprint to Snapchat. Several individuals reported seeing Tory adverts on the youth-oriented network - including one who saw a Conservative advert just after he had finished watching a Snapchat story from Jeremy Corbyn. It is not clear how that ad reached the user; whether the Conservative Party paid for it to be delivered to Corbyn's Snapchat followers. However, it's clear that the Conservative Party is trying to spread its reach across a wide range of social networks.\n\nThe majority of adverts seen by our readers have been paid for by the Conservatives. This might be explained by our unscientific methodology - Labour supporters might have been more motivated to send us examples of Conservative ads than vice versa. However, the Conservatives have in the past invested more heavily in online advertising than the other parties. During the 2015 election campaign, the Tories spent over \u00a3300,000 on Google advertising (including YouTube ads), whereas Labour only spent \u00a3371. \n\nAdverts have also been placed on lesser known social networks and apps not considered to be traditional locations for political messages. Several people told Trending that they had seen Conservative videos pop up on popular mobile phone games.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Labour is relying less on paid advertising in order to spread its message. Corbyn boasts more than double the number of Facebook likes than May, and this unpaid online army has proven effective at spreading Labour's message organically. Yet, although the methods of political parties might be different, their intentions are the same: to win over swing votes ahead of 8 June.\n\nBlog by Sam Bright\n\nWe're still keen to get a better understanding of social media advertising during the general election. \n\nIf you spot an advert in your social media feed which looks political then please send us a screengrab or a link to the content.

What will the style of play be? Are they the right fit at the club? Can they manage the big stars?\n\nBusiness is no different.\n\nYet with Amazon's new chief executive, we kind of know what to expect. \n\nAmazon's business is so big it essentially acts as an umbrella organisation for many different companies. \n\nMr Jassy has been at the company for 23 years, conducted plenty of interviews, and has been pretty open about what makes him tick. \n\nHe also runs its most lucrative business - Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAmazon's quarterly results, announced on Tuesday, confirm that AWS is the driving force behind its profits - accounting for about half of the company's operating income.\n\nIt saw the potential for the outsourcing of computing and storage, that companies use to run things like websites, before its rivals. \n\nGoogle and Microsoft got into the game later  - and now offer similar services. However, there's a clear market leader in the field, and that's Amazon.\n\nAccording to one estimate, AWS accounts for about a third of worldwide cloud infrastructure spend.\n\nIt's a long way away from where Amazon started - as an online shop selling books.\n\nMr Jassy, who founded AWS in 2003, nurtured this side-bet of Amazon's into a money-spinner - and became the obvious successor to Mr Bezos.\n\nAnd the way Mr Jassy has relentlessly developed AWS is strikingly similar to the way Mr Bezos went about building Amazon, and he is most certainly moulded in his predecessor's image. \n\nAWS has become so successful it's even become a focus of anti-trust campaigners - and the Federal Trade Commission. So should it be hived off from Amazon entirely? \n\nInvestors want Amazon to have many more offshoots like AWS - hugely profitable firms all under the company's banner. \n\nThat's what Mr Jassy has delivered before, and that's what they hope he can do again. \n\nAmazon has a burgeoning advertising business. It has acquired companies like Whole Foods and Ring home security systems, and is venturing into pharmacy. And don't forget Amazon Prime. All of these businesses have plenty of room to grow.\n\nYou might expect shares in Amazon to take a dive on the news that Mr Bezos had stepped back. But the market seemed pretty relaxed about the move. They know Mr Jassy, and see him as an able replacement. \n\nIt's not uncommon for a hyper-rich founder to do this - there are precedents. Think of Sergey Brin and Larry Page at Google or Bill Gates at Microsoft. Those two companies have done fantastically well under Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella respectively. \n\nAnd Mr Bezos is not leaving, remember. He'll be less involved in running the everyday aspects of the company, but Amazon is still his baby, he'll still be the most influential person in whichever room he finds himself at the company. \n\nMr Bezos's move then is capturing headlines. However, Amazon has become a very big, very successful company - and that's likely to continue under Mr Jassy.\nTL;DR: Andy Jassy is not a household name.\n\nArticle: The medal, which was found in a drawer, had belonged to Elsie Wolff Van Sandau.\n\nMiss Sandau was arrested after allegedly smashing a window during an organised campaign on 4 March 1912 and later went on hunger strike.\n\nThe medal for valour will be auctioned on 27 June in Derbyshire and is estimated to go for \u00a37,000 to \u00a310,000.\n\nMiss Sandau had also been arrested on 18 November 1910 during the Black Friday riots, where about 300 suffragettes met a wall of policemen outside Parliament.\n\nHeavily outnumbered, the women were assaulted by both police and male vigilantes in the crowd.

Alternatively, they can pay a deposit on a loan cup and return it when finished.\n\nWhile paper cups can be recycled at specialist plants, they are not suitable for recycling with other paper and cardboard products because they contain a plastic lining.\n\nOther UK coffee chains have also announced plans to cut waste. Costa, for example, has vowed to recycle as many cups as it puts into the market by 2020 - but Mr Roberts does not believe such plans are effective. \n\n\"Lots of coffee chains are making pledges about how they plan to tackle cup waste in the future,\"he said,\"but theirs is a future which is too far away.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate to other operators that to make a difference, big change is needed.  \n\n\"We will make this work and we'll share details of how we've done it with anyone who wants our help to do the same.\"\n\nWhat are other coffee chains doing?\n\nCosta Coffee has promised to recycle as many cups as it puts into the market by 2020 and also offers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup.\n\nPret A Manger offers customers a 50p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup.\n\nStarbucks offers customers a 25p discount on hot beverages if they bring their own reusable cup.

Praising the temperature checks at the airport and extra measures in the local hotels, he said:\"whoever wants to go on holiday to Majorca has to help ensure there's no new outbreak.\"\n\nQuieter nightlife as the clubs stay silent\n\nAlthough flights to Majorca are expected to reach levels of 30% to 40% of a normal summer, the atmosphere at Palma Beach is set to remain considerably more sedate than other years. Mr Ferrer accepts that the Covid-19 effect will accelerate the existing tendency towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences. \n\nIn June the Balearic Islands government announced that nocturnal excesses would not be a part of this summer.\n\nThere are strict rules limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and nightclubs are banned from operating at all in Magaluf and Palma Beach on Majorca as well as Sant Antoni on Ibiza - the resorts that have become notorious for so-called\"booze tourism\".\n\n\"There won't be that kind of mass tourism because those places are not going to open; it's a clear message,\"says Iago Negueruela, the Balearic minister for the economy, labour and tourism.\n\n\"We had already started a process and it is irreversible. The pubs won't open this year. We are no longer going to receive or tolerate that kind of tourist, who can be a risk for themselves and others.\"\n\nMr Negueruela highlights the law against\"tourism of excesses\"that his government introduced at the start of the year, banning pub crawls and happy hours. \n\nEnd of an era for'booze tourism'?\n\nThe current situation can only accelerate the end of what he says is a mere remnant of a bygone age, the minister argues.\n\n\"Our hotel sector has already staked out its preference for quality and not just numbers, but the perception does not always accompany the reality. Even in Magaluf, a transformation has been taking place, with a focus on five-star hotels, its beaches and gastronomy.\"\n\nIndustry leaders recognise that Covid-19 may make crowding a taboo for all future visitors. \n\n\"Some elements of this crisis might be temporary, like face masks,\"says Andreu Serra, tourism chief for the Mallorca Council island administration.\"But this is also an opportunity to improve our care of tourists, by using technology to control numbers so we know when beaches will be full, and generally boosting hygiene in all hospitality areas.\"\n\nTime to turn away from tourism?\n\nNot everyone is sighing in relief at the return of tourists to Majorca and the other islands.\n\nLocal environmentalists criticise the over-dependence on a sector that has transformed the archipelago's landscape, while creating employment that is largely low-paid and seasonal in nature as property prices and even rents skyrocket beyond the means of most employees.  \n\nFor Antoni Pallicer Mateu, a member of publishing collective Tot Incl\u00f2s that aim to inform on tourism's impact on the islands, Balearic citizens and in particular Majorcans have become prisoners to a sector\"that is so vulnerable to instability\"and whose use of resources is such that almost all other needs have to be imported.\n\n\"Now it's a pandemic, but in the near future it could be a climate or energy crisis, or simply a crisis in our main markets of Germany and the UK,\"argues Mr Pallicer Mateu.\n\n\"Tourism benefits tour operators, agencies, hotel chains, rental companies like Airbnb, and also a Majorcan middle class who own property and companies. But it is benefiting the working class and small businesses less and less. Mass tourism is driving us towards unsustainability and an environmental and even social collapse.\" \n\nIn the Balearic high season, the population of the islands usually doubles due to tourism, as the one million residents are matched by a million tourists. Little wonder, then, that registered unemployment in May was double the normal amount for that month, at 75,000.\n\n\"We have tourism dependency, and we will for another 15 years at least, because no other alternative has been developed,\"says Mr Ferrer, noting that the non-services part of the economy only covers 15% of Balearic GDP.\n\n\"It's a moment of political opportunity to criticise tourism right now, but that's what is paying people's wages every month,\"Mr Ferrer continues.\n\n\"I doubt many of our waiters and waitresses who have been out of work these past few months would subscribe to this point of view.\"\nTL;DR: As Spain scrambles to save its vital tourism industry from the threat of a blank year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some sense an opportunity to change perceptions about Spanish holidays and start a move upmarket that has been long on the agenda.\n\nArticle: Efforts will resume on Monday to persuade the EU to agree changes to the\"backstop\"plan to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border.\n\nAnd Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright has hinted MPs' concerns about it could be addressed without reopening the deal.\n\nLabour says the Tories cannot be united and has called for cross-party talks.\n\nThe UK remains on course to leave the EU on 29 March. But Mrs May has been unable to convince a majority of MPs to back the withdrawal terms she struck with the EU last year.\n\nThe prime minister told MPs in the letter she will return to Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, and speak to the leaders of every EU member state over the coming days.\n\nHer main goal is to win concessions over the backstop, which is widely disliked by members of her party.\n\nMany fear it will mean the UK staying closely aligned to EU rules for the long term, without Britain being able to end the agreement unilaterally.\n\nBut EU leaders have repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. \n\nThe Sunday Times reported comments it said were leaked from a WhatsApp group suggesting ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told fellow Brexiteers that Mrs May's talks with Brussels were a\"complete waste of time\".\n\nHowever, Culture Secretary Mr Wright has hinted that there might be\"a number of different ways\"around the problem.\n\n\"I don't think it's the mechanism that matters, it's the objective,\"he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, when asked whether a codicil - a supplementary document explaining or modifying a legal agreement - might work.\n\n\"Parliament needs to give the prime minister space to have that conversation with Brussels,\"he added.\n\nAttorney General Geoffrey Cox, who has warned the backstop indefinitely commits the UK to EU customs rules if Brexit trade talks break down, will set out what changes would be needed to address concerns in a speech on Tuesday.\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is also due to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss the controversial policy on Monday.\n\nIf MPs do not approve a formal deal, many fear chaos at ports and for business. \n\nAnd Tobias Ellwood has become the first minister to publicly declare a willingness to rebel against the government if the PM failed to rule out a no-deal scenario.\n\n\"There are many ministers, me being one of them, that need to see'no deal' removed from the table,\"the defence minister told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Andrew Marr that\"serious discussion\"around building cross-party consensus must happen by the end of the month.\n\n\"We have put our proposals on the table; we're willing to negotiate around those,\"he said.\"They're the basis of what we think could secure parliamentary approval, but she has to start negotiating as well.\"\n\nThe PM's negotiating stance has never been\"based upon mutual interest or mutual respect\"but was\"about banging the table and walking away\", he added.\n\nAsked about the prospect of a further referendum, Mr McDonnell said the party's priority remained a Brexit deal that protected jobs and the economy.\n\nBut he added:\"We really are at the end of the line now... If [a deal] doesn't fly within Parliament, yes the option of going back to the people has got to be there.\"\n\nCampaigners for another referendum on Brexit have said there will be a major protest the weekend before Britain's scheduled departure date on 29 March.\n\n'Failure to make compromises'\n\nIn her letter, Mrs May described the latest Commons defeat over her Brexit strategy, in which dozens of Conservatives abstained on Thursday, as\"disappointing\".\n\n\"I do not underestimate how deeply or how sincerely colleagues hold the views which they do on this important issue - or that we are all motivated by a common desire to do what is best for our country, even if we disagree on the means of doing so,\"she writes.\n\n\"But I believe that a failure to make the compromises necessary to reach and take through Parliament a withdrawal agreement which delivers on the result of the referendum will let down the people who sent us to represent them and risk the bright future that they all deserve.\"\n\n'No change in tactics'\n\nAnalysis by Peter Saull, BBC political reporter\n\nSince Thursday and the 10th defeat in the House of Commons for Theresa May over Brexit, the tensions in the Conservative Party have threatened to boil over.\n\nThe war of words has reached ministerial level, with business minister Richard Harrington suggesting some of his pro-Brexit colleagues should join former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's new party.\n\nTherefore while there's nothing new in terms of the substance of this letter, it represents a clear attempt by the prime minister to calm things down.\n\nTheresa May is also making it clear she won't change tactics. \n\nThe PM believes the only way to get a deal through the Commons and keep her party together is by securing changes to the backstop, even if the EU shows no sign of budging. \n\nPlease upgrade your browser\n\nYour guide to Brexit jargon\nTL;DR: Theresa May has written to all 317 Tory MPs, urging them to unite behind a Brexit deal while warning them \"history will judge us all\" over the process.\n\nArticle: A \u00a37m fund will be used to support economic development initiatives in Guernsey, with a further \u00a3900,000 budgeted over three years in Alderney.\n\nTreasury Minister Gavin St Pier described the move as a new approach for the States.\n\nHe said:\"Our expectation is that the fund will become self sustaining, but it will be dependant on results.\"\n\nDeputy St Pier said funds would only be released after business cases detailing the objectives and benefits of spending had been accepted by his department.\n\n'Arcane accounting'\n\nHe said it was likely to be used to\"encourage digital industries\"and\"to grow the number of high-value jobs and therefore the tax base\".\n\nRobert MacDowall, chairman of Alderney's Finance Committee and deputy chairman of Alderney's Policy and Finance Committee, welcomed the move.\n\nHe said he was glad the\"arcane accounting structure\"was changing to allow the funds, which are currently ring fenced for capital projects, to be used in this way.\n\nMr MacDowall said the impact of the money would be measured over a period of three to five years.\nTL;DR: Nearly \u00a38m will be injected into Guernsey's and Alderney's economies in a bid to encourage growth. \n\n\n\nArticle: The group from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland called on Theresa May to approve a third runway at the airport, describing it as\"our gateway to the world\".\n\nThe government could make a decision as early as this week.\n\nMrs May is believed not to favour a compromise option that would see both Heathrow and Gatwick build new runways.\n\nThe group urging the prime minister to approve Heathrow expansion includes Welsh Conservative MP and former  cabinet minister Stephen Crabb, Northern Irish DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and Welsh Labour's Stephen Kinnock.\n\nAll three signed the letter to Mrs May which argued:\"Although Heathrow is in London, it is the UK's hub airport.\n\n\"Other countries are investing in and supporting their hub, or looking on enviously as they hub through other countries.\n\n\"Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have our own successful and growing airports.\n\n\"But Heathrow is our gateway to the world, bringing tourists to our attractions and helping our exporters reach new markets.\n\n\"Whether we are connected by road, rail or air, we know that connections to Heathrow are a key driver of investment decisions.\n\n\"Expanding Heathrow will create nearly four times more jobs in our three nations than other options being considered.\"\n\n'Fight tooth and nail'\n\nMrs May faces considerable opposition to a third runway at Heathrow within her own cabinet as well as the Conservative Party and former Prime Minister David Cameron repeatedly put off making a decision.\n\nTory MP Adam Afriyie said he would vote against Heathrow expansion in defiance of party whips if there was no free vote in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Windsor MP told the BBC's Sunday Politics show:\"Oh, 100% yes.

They are part of us.\"She repeated her pledge that no one with the right to be in the UK would be deported.\n\nJeremy Corbyn referred back to a case he had raised a month ago at Prime Minister's Questions - that of Albert Thompson, a man who had been denied NHS cancer treatment he was entitled to because he did not have the right documentation. He accused Mrs May of\"brushing it off\".\n\nThe Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, said Mrs May, and his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. She suggested Mr Thompson was not part of the Windrush generation.\n\nThen it was on to the landing cards - documents that could have shown when Commonwealth citizens arrived in the UK - that were destroyed by the UK Border Agency during an office move in 2010.\n\nMr Corbyn tried to pin the decision on Mrs May who was home secretary in 2010 when it was thought to have been taken. Not so, said Mrs May,\"the decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009 under a Labour government\". \n\nThis was news to Mr Corbyn and everybody else (Labour's Jacqui Smith and then Alan Johnson were the home secretaries during the year in question and they have both said they can't remember anything about it).\n\nThe Labour leader switched to an attack on the\"hostile environment\"for illegal immigrants that was created by Home Secretary May, in 2014, which he said had led to the current Windrush debacle. \n\nHe then swung back round on to the landing cards, suggesting again Mrs May had been responsible and saying Parliament needed\"absolute clarity\"on when the decision was taken. It was in 2009, Mrs May told him.\n\nThe prime minister - perhaps sensing that she had got one over on Mr Corbyn - then ventured into a defence of her crackdown on illegal immigration, saying it was\"absolutely right\"that only people entitled to use public services used them.\n\n\"This isn't about illegal immigration,\"said Mr Corbyn, but about Commonwealth citizens\"who have a right to be here\". He asked how many people from the Windrush generation have been deported.\n\nMr Corbyn said he had just received information that Albert Thompson had still not been told when he will get the treatment he needs.\n\nShouting across the despatch box as the noise levels from MPs rose, Mr Corbyn said the responsibility for the Windrush debacle\"lies firmly at the prime minister's door\"because of her\"pandering to bogus immigration targets\"when she was home secretary, which he said had led to a\"hostile environment\"and British citizens\"thrown into detention centres like criminals\".\n\nHe said the Windrush generation came to the UK after the war to help rebuild the country, and claimed Mrs May's government was both\"heartless and hopeless\"and\"callous and incompetent\".\n\nTheresa May agreed that the Windrush generation\"did help to build our country, they are British\"which was why the government was working to ensure they could prove their status.\n\nShe then took an angry swipe at Mr Corbyn over allegations of anti-Semitism aired by some of his own MPs in an emotional Commons debate on Tuesday.\n\n\"He talks about being callous, I will not take that from a man who allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party.\"\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's Leader at Westminster Ian Blackford zeroed in on Esther McVey, who sparked controversy on Monday by describing the so-called\"rape clause\"in Universal Credit as an opportunity for victims to get help. Did the PM agree with the work pension secretary?\n\nEllie Reeves, Labour MP for  Lewisham West and Penge, asked if the rise in violent crime in London was down to police cuts.\n\nThe Verdicts\n\nHere's what the BBC's Andrew Neil and Laura Kuenssberg made of it:\n\nAnd here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on it:\n\nThat was just about as bitter a PMQs exchange as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have had.\n\nThe PM was accused of pandering to fears about immigration and creating a Home Office that was\"heartless and hopeless\". But the PM was prepared.\n\nA critical detail in the Windrush saga is the destruction of critical immigration records - and she said that decision was taken under a Labour government.\n\nIt was a point of detail which tripped the Labour leader up - and his voice increasingly had that edge of anger that creeps in in pressure situations.\n\nThe PM had, courtesy of a former special advisor, Neil O'Brien, already taken the opportunity to lay out her position before Mr Corbyn rose - and she didn't give an inch, in the face of intense attack in an unruly House.\n\nAnd her lashback about Labour's internal battle over anti-Semitism delighted her side.\n\nCornered on unfavourable ground, the PM won this exchange - although Jeremy Corbyn's succession of pointed phrases are doubtless already running on Facebook, and will play well with his target voters.\n\nThe Speaker intervened several times to quieten the House and rebuke hecklers - at one point complaining of\"stupid\"behaviour. Although he didn't name the miscreants. The atmosphere was poisonous - and with the political temperature rising, it will probably continue to curdle.\n\nNo-one expects sugary matiness at PMQs, but this kind of mutual contempt is corrosive.\n\nPredictably (although I failed to predict it) there were plenty of questions pegged to the Commonwealth summit, taking place a short distance away.\n\nNigel Evans raised the issue of gay rights in Commonwealth countries, Stella Creasey complained about an extradition case.\n\nAnd in 40 minutes, no-one mentioned Brexit.\n\nWhat pundits are saying on Twitter\n\nAnd finally, for podcast fans\nTL;DR: Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened.\n\nArticle: Transport minister Andrew Jones told MPs he was to assess whether Scotland's move had had an impact on road safety.\n\nBut the DfT later confirmed it was not undertaking a review to also move the legal level down from 80mg to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.\n\nRoad safety campaigners urged ministers to learn from Scotland's experience.\n\nMr Jones said:\"The government believes rigorous enforcement and serious penalties for drink-drivers are a more effective deterrent than changing the drink-driving limit.\n\n\"Britain continues to have some of the safest roads in the world because we crack down on those who break the law.\"\n\n'Hardcore offenders'\n\nSpeculation about a potential law change emerged on Tuesday when, in response to a written parliamentary question, Mr Jones said:\"It is important to base our decisions on evidence and the Scottish experience will be crucial to that before we consider any possible changes to the limits in England and Wales.\"\n\nThe current 80mg limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - equivalent to 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - is higher than most other European countries.\n\nNorthern Ireland is consulting on whether to lower its limit to 50mg for most motorists, with an effective zero limit for learner, novice and professional drivers.\n\nSteve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said:\"It would be a poor argument to say cut the drink-drive limit just because others have done it, but there is now plenty of data to suggest a change would have a marked improvement in road safety terms.\"\n\nEdmund King, the president of the AA, said:\"It seems a sensible step to bring us into line with Scotland and the majority of European countries.\n\n\"However, it would probably be more effective for the police to target hardcore offenders who are way over the current limit as they are involved in the most deaths and injuries on the road.\"\n\n'Morning after risk'\n\nMr King added with a lower limit drivers\"also have to be aware of being over the limit the morning after\".\n\nThe road safety charity Brake urged ministers to learn from the\"successful reduction of the drink drive limit in Scotland\", which happened in December 2014, and review laws.\n\nBecause everyone has a different susceptibility to alcohol, health experts say it is difficult to quantify exactly how many units can be drunk by drivers.\n\nFor the average man, a 50mg limit would mean they could consume just under a pint of beer or a large glass of wine and for women, half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine. \n\nA spokesman for the British Beer and Pub Association said it believed the current limit in England and Wales was\"well understood\"by the public. \n\n\"We have some of the safest roads in Europe and key to that is education, awareness and tough enforcement,\"he added.\nTL;DR: There are no plans to lower the drink-drive limit in England and Wales to bring it in line with Scotland, the Department for Transport has said.\n\nArticle: The metal plaque was taken from Bridge Street in the town some time between 20 April and 5 May.\n\nCheshire Police said a 28-year-old man from Newton-le-Willows had been bailed until 5 July.\n\nA 57-year-old man from Penketh was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of theft.\n\nHe was bailed, also until 5 July, pending further investigations.\n\nThe plaque, which formed part of the River of Life memorial, was recovered in its original state at the time of the arrest of the 57-year-old man, police said.\n\nTim Parry, 12, and Johnathan Ball, three, died when two bombs were detonated in Warrington town centre on 20 March 1993.

Until Friday, the council was telling MPs and county council backbenchers it could balance the books. \n\n\"Now it is saying it is in grave danger of not doing that. This demonstrates the collapse of financial controls at the council.\"\n\nMichael Ellis, MP for Northampton North, said the situation was dire and it was\"time for a change of leadership\".\n\nThe statement said the current inspection of the council, instigated last year, should conclude quickly and lead to the appointment of commissioners. \n\n\"It should be noted that the county's financial problems are self-inflicted,\"it added.\n\nThe MPs - all of whom are Conservative - said they had confidence in council staff working in\"tough circumstances\"but launched a scathing attack on its leadership and cabinet.\n\nBackbench county councillors, it said, were capable of driving the council forward\"if only they were given the opportunity to do so\"but were\"undermined\"by cabinet members when they attempted to scrutinise decisions.\n\n\"We had concerns that if the leadership of the council were giving government the same information they were giving us as MPs... then a completely incorrect picture of the council's finances would be being passed on, which in turn would undermine any legitimate ask for fairer funding,\"the statement said.\n\nThe authority's final budget proposals for 2018/19 include a council tax increase of 5.98%, including the 3% adult social care precept.\n\nCuts totalling \u00a32,748,000 have been proposed to bus subsidies, trading standards, winter maintenance and library services. \n\nThe budget will go before the council's cabinet on 13 February.\n\nLeader Heather Smith said\"revisions may be required\"given the Section 114 notice issued. \n\nAnalysis by Sam Read, BBC Radio Northampton's political reporter\n\nFor these Tory MPs to criticise this Conservative council leadership shows, along with the section 114 notice, just how serious this is.\n\nThis is not just another council funding story;

I'm looking for things I've never seen before.\"\n\nDirector Timoner, who is also a screenwriter, has twice won the top award at the Sundance festival for independent film with her documentaries Dig! and We Live in Public.\n\n'Indelible passion'\n\nShe tweeted that she wanted to make the film for the anniversary of Mapplethorpe's death, linking to Hollywood's story about Smith and Mamet taking starring roles.\n\n\"We'll honour Mapplethorpe on the 25th year of his death by bringing him to life on screen,\"she said.\n\nShe also told Deadline:\"After several years of developing this script and searching across the globe for the perfect talent to embody the rich and layered roles of visionary artists Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith, I am ecstatic to have found Matt Smith and Zosia Mamet. \n\n\"They will bring indelible passion, raw humanity, and authenticity to this timeless, inspiring story.\"\n\nMapplethorpe died of Aids in 1989, aged 42. An HBO documentary about his life called Mapplethorpe: Look At The Pictures made its premiere at Sundance this week. \n\nSmith will next be seen on the big screen in comedy-horror Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, opposite Lily James, Jack Huston and Sam Riley, which opens in the UK on 11 February.\n\nHe is also making a Netflix series called The Crown, which sees him playing Prince Philip with Claire Foy playing the Queen.\nTL;DR: Matt Smith is to take on the role of avant-garde photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in a forthcoming film.\n\nArticle: The project would see the addition of a fly tower, a new circle of seats, a dance-studio and improvements to accessibility in the building.\n\n\"The last refurbishment was in 1988, and significant improvements are needed,\"said Councillor Mike Best.\n\nThe Octagon has suffered big capacity problems in recent years. \n\nOf the last 250 shows staged there, 100 were either sold out or at 90% capacity. \n\nThe authority will now look to the Arts Council and other bodies to raise the money needed for the refurbishment.\n\nThe expansion means the building would become Somerset's biggest theatre and on a par with Bath's Theatre Royal, which also has 900 seats.\n\n\"There has been a clear need to refurbish the building for many years and work on these plans started long before the pandemic,\"said Adam Burgan, arts and entertainment venues manager at Somerset District Council.\n\n\"This project will deliver \u00a39.3m economic boost for the area every year.\n\n\"It will mean a big increase in the quality of shows we bring to Yeovil,\"he said. \n\nSome members of the public raised concerns over the council's financial obligations, with one speaker, Andrew Pope, urging the council not to take on liability for the whole cost. \n\n\"Financially, doing nothing is not an option here,\"said Councillor Peter Seib. \n\n\"Many expensive repairs are needed, and these issues would turn into a huge cost if we do nothing.\"\n\nWhen construction work begins, productions will move to the Westlands Entertainment Venue nearby.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nOctagon Theatre, Yeovil\nTL;DR: A \u00a323m expansion of Yeovil's Octagon theatre has been approved in principle by councillors at South Somerset District Council.\n\nArticle: The band are up for best album, international band, video, single and live performance.\n\nA statement from My Chemical Romance said:\"The UK has always been one of our favourite places to play as a band.\n\n\"We are so grateful for these nominations and the continued support from Kerrang!, its readers and our fans.

It was away from the sporting world, away from protein shakes and dumbbells.\n\n\"He was also waiting for a student loan to come through for months. He was expecting it originally in November but it didn't come through until late January early February in the end and it left him in a bit of a financial pickle over the Christmas period. \n\n\"It was always on his mind, when is it going to come, when is it going to come.\"\n\n'Radical new approach'\n\nEarlier this month Universities UK warned they risked\"failing a generation\"unless there were improvements in mental health care for students.\n\nPresident-elect of NUS Wales Gwyneth Sweatman said:\"There is more that universities need to be doing. They need to be funding student services better. Universities have a duty of care to make sure their students are okay.\"\n\nOne Welsh university is trialling a radical new approach to try to reduce the pressure on first-year students while they are still adapting to being away from home.\n\nThe Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama is not giving students on two courses marks this year - instead focusing on individual feedback.\n\nIt comes after an increase in demand for support services.\n\nHead of student services Brian Weir said:\"I think there's a terrible amount of pressure on young people today to succeed. There are probably several factors involved in that.\n\n\"Students are investing quite heavily in financial terms, and the pressure to want to be successful, the pressure to fulfil your ambition means that people are driving towards that attainment, attached to the fact that there are tens of thousands of pounds of investment from them needed to do that.\n\nHe added:\"We're trialling in two of our courses - acting and design for performance - removing that number from that feedback and talking to students on a much more one-to-one level.\"\n\nDirector of Universities Wales, Amanda Wilkinson, said:\"Universities cannot address these challenges alone and we will continue to work in partnership with parents, schools, employers and with NHS Wales and other statutory services to coordinate care for students.\n\n\"It is timely that the Welsh Government has remitted the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales to develop further work in this area, and we are dedicated to working with them and the National Union of Students in Wales on this vitally important agenda to ensure students can access the care they need.\"\n\nWales Live, BBC One Wales on Wednesday at 22:30 BST\n\nDetails of organisations which offer advice and support are available here and the BBC Action Line or you can call for free, at any time, to hear recorded information 0800 066 066.\nTL;DR: More could be done to support students who are vulnerable to suicide, a senior Welsh Government advisor has said.\n\nArticle: Officials said protesters in Lufeng city injured police officers and damaged government buildings during the unrest that began on Wednesday. \n\nA reporter for Reuters news agency who visited Lufeng on Friday said protests had continued at government offices. \n\nThere are tens of thousands of protests each year in China, some of which turn violent. \n\nMany are triggered by local grievances, such as farmers being expelled from their land to make way for development. \n\n'Ulterior motives'\n\nOne media report said several thousand people had taken part in the violence earlier this week in Wukan village, which is part of Lufeng city, in Guangdong province.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, protesters targeted a Communist Party building, a police station and an industrial park, amongst others. \n\nThey believe that local party officials have sold their land to developers, the daily said. \n\nImages on internet forums showed villagers marching with a banner that read:\"Return my ancestral farmland\". \n\nLocal officials said only a few hundred people had been involved.\n\nIn a statement, they said that while a land deal had been the initial trigger, rumours that police had killed a child sparked further anger. \n\n\"On 22 September at about one in the afternoon, some villagers who had ulterior motives spread rumours about police killing a child, inciting some of the villagers to storm a border police station,\"the statement said.\n\nLocal officials said 12 officers had been wounded and six police cars burnt. Residents said a number of protesters had also been hurt, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nA Reuters reporter who visited Lufeng on Friday said several hundred people were still protesting outside government offices, calling for their land to be returned. \n\n\"We are very angry because we have no land for our livelihood anymore,\"one farmer was quoted as saying. \n\nThe scene was tense but there was no violence, the agency reported. Protesters had used motorbikes to block roads and broken bricks were piled up. \n\nSearches for the word Lufeng on micro-blogging sites were reportedly being blocked. \n\nStability fears\n\nThere are hundreds of protests in China every week, says the BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing. \n\nSome are small in scale and centre on local grievances, but certain issues keep cropping up.\n\nOne often-heard complaint is that corrupt officials collude with developers to sell off farmland without giving farmers the proper compensation.\n\nLaws are in place to protect farmers, but are often ignored at local level. \n\nEarlier this year, addressing the opening of the National People's Congress, Premier Wen Jiabao warned that if China wanted to ensure social stability it had to tackle corruption and address economic inequalities.\nTL;DR: Protests have taken place in a Chinese city for a third day, after two days of reported rioting over a land sale.\n\nArticle: By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News, Istanbul\n\nOnly Russia and Ireland have worse access to IVF treatment, according to work presented at the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology.\n\nThe lead author said many NHS trusts had been\"feeble\"at providing IVF. \n\nThe British Fertility Society said some NHS trusts needed to do more for infertile couples.\n\nDr Mark Connolly, from the University of Groningen, analysed fertility policies across 23 European countries from 2007 onwards.\n\nThose with the highest ratings for funding or reimbursement were Belgium, France and Slovenia. \n\nItaly, Montenegro and Portugal all had higher levels of funding than the UK.\n\nUnmet need\n\nData presented to the meeting in Turkey showed this affected the chances of treatment.\n\nNearly 2,500 IVF cycles took place per million people in Belgium compared with a figure of 825 cycles in the UK.\n\nDr Connolly said:\"If one considers medical need is similar across countries then the data here suggest a great unmet need in those countries with limited reimbursement.\"\n\nOfficial guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) say women should be allowed three free courses of IVF treatment. Each cycle costs around \u00a33,000.\n\nThe latest  \n          \n \n          draft guidelines\n also recommend widening access to older women.\n        \n\nHowever, the decision about how much IVF is funded is taken locally by individual primary care trusts.\n\n\"I think most trusts were feeble in their ability to provide that [IVF],\"said Dr Connolly.\n\nDr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said:\"It just makes me depressed.\n\n\"If primary care trusts would sign up to the level of provision NICE says we should, we'd be up there in the statistics.\n\n\"But some PCTs won't budge on it.\"\n\nDr Connolly also warned that IVF could become a victims of the economic turmoil in Europe. \n\nHe said all health funding was being appraised and that\"in many cases assisted reproduction is subject to the whims of various budget authorities trying to decide what they can fund and what they cannot.\"\n\nThe International Federation of Fertility Societies said:\"In many states the pendulum is swinging towards the need to increase fertility which underlines the need to improve access to cost effective and safe IVF.\"\n\nClare Lewis-Jones of the National Infertility Awareness Campaign said:\"It is totally unacceptable that many other European countries have better service provision for infertility patients than the UK, where IVF was pioneered.\n\n\"Infertility treatment has for too long been seen as a low priority, failing the one in six couples who live with the devastating impact this illness has on their lives.\"\nTL;DR: It is harder for couples in the UK to get financial help with their fertility treatment than in almost any other European country, experts say.\n\nArticle: Under the pension proposals, workers will also be expected to work for five more years before they can receive their full pension.\n\nUnite joins other steel unions, Community, GMB and Ucatt, in voting for strike action.\n\nTata said the strike vote was\"very disappointing\".\n\nIf the action goes ahead, it will be the first national steel strike for 30 years.\n\nThe four unions represent 17,000 steel workers who have been told that they may have to retire at 65 rather than 60 under the new pension proposals.\n\nTata released an open letter to employees last Friday which said Tata's UK operations were losing money and the pension scheme had a shortfall of more than \u00a32bn.\n\nBut Unite and the other unions claim that they have\"already offered pension savings of \u00a3850m to the company after five months of intensive negotiations\".\n\nUnite national officer for steel Paul Reuter said:\"Our members have made it clear that they are not prepared to have their contracts with their futures torn up in front of their eyes.\n\n\"We have offered Tata Steel UK the savings it says it needs. Instead the company is hell-bent on making people who work in a physically demanding environment graft unnecessarily for a further five years to get their full pension.\"\n\nUnite said it would meet the other steel unions next week to discuss next steps, including industrial action.\n\n'New measures'\n\nA Tata Steel spokesman said:\"We have been trying to develop an affordable and sustainable pension scheme for employees, so today's ballot result is very disappointing.\"\n\nThe firm pointed out that less than half the workforce voted for strike action.\n\nBut in signs that Tata may be bowing to pressure from the unions, it said:\"We have over the last few months listened carefully to our employees during a consultation process. \n\n\"In response to this feedback, we will soon be announcing new measures which will lessen the impact of the proposed pension changes, particularly on our longest-serving employees nearing retirement age.\n\n\"We hope that these important changes to our proposals will be welcomed by employees and the trade unions and that they will consider this when deciding on any industrial action.\"\n\nCheap imports\n\nProfits within the UK steel industry are being squeezed by cheap imports and weak demand. Its costs are also higher than elsewhere for both energy and labour. \n\nThe company's parent, India's Tata Steel Ltd, reported an $889m (\u00a3582m) quarterly loss this month, partly because of its UK business. \n\nIn Wales, Tata has sites in Port Talbot, Llanwern in Newport, Shotton in Flintshire and Trostre, Carmarthenshire.\n\nIt also has a plant at Motherwell in Scotland, while in England, there are plants at Corby, Scunthorpe, Redcar, Rotherham, Hartlepool, Walsall and Wednesbury.\nTL;DR: Tata Steel workers belonging to the Unite union have voted to go on strike in protest at the closure of the British Steel pension scheme.\n\nArticle: At present taxis are only allowed to pick up fares within their licensing district.\n\nThe Department of Infrastructure asked people for their views on plans for an all-island taxi trade.\n\nThe results of an online survey and written responses revealed that 78% of respondents favoured the move.\n\n'Difficult to proceed'\n\nIn the online survey, 264 out of 296 respondents said they wanted all licensed taxis to be able to pick up passengers throughout the island.\n\nThe department received 100 written responses, of which 45 were in favour and 31 against the proposal. \n\nMinister Phil Gawne said that Tynwald was in favour of the changes.\n\nHe said:\"It now appears a majority of the population is in favour as well. \n\n\"Unfortunately with legislation it's often very difficult to proceed at the pace politically that we'd like to proceed, but I would certainly want to see the taxi legislation brought before Tynwald well in advance of the next election.\"\nTL;DR: Proposals to allow ply-for-hire taxis to operate throughout the Isle of Man have received public support during a government consultation exercise. \n\n\n\nArticle: Kent County Council's environment and transport cabinet committee discussed three options to tackle overnight lorry parking and Operation Stack.\n\nThe matter will now pass to the cabinet member for environment and transport, with a public consultation in January.\n\nIf approved, construction of the site could be completed by May 2018.\n\nCouncillors said a government decision on the preferred corridor for a new Lower Thames Crossing could be a significant influence on the location of a second lorry park, which could be constructed within the next five to six years.\n\nWestenhanger was selected from three possible options, which also included sites at Ashford and Dover.\n\nThousands of lorries pass through the county every day but there is only official capacity for parking about 550 of them at any one time at nine existing truck stops. \n\nProblems have also been caused by lorries parking overnight in residential roads, industrial areas and country lanes, resulting in noise, nuisance, litter and anti-social behaviour.\n\nThe council said the new park would also act as a holding area for HGVs during Operation Stack, when lorries are held on the M20 if there is disruption or delays at the Port of Dover.\nTL;DR: A site off the M20 at Westenhanger is the preferred location of councillors in Kent for the construction of a new lorry park.\n\nArticle: Charles Rippey, 100, and his wife, Sara, 98, perished in one of 22 blazes that have destroyed 115,000 acres (26,000ha) and 3,500 buildings. \n\nThe couple, originally from Wisconsin, first met in primary school, their sons told the New York Times. \n\nOfficials in the hard-hit Sonoma County say 380 people are still missing. \n\nWineries count cost of wildfires disaster\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano earlier said 670 people were missing, adding the situation was changing quickly. \n\nHe also said about 150 people have been located and expects that some of those who have been found have yet to update their status on the missing registry. \n\nMore evacuations were ordered on Wednesday as the winds shifted. The entire town of Calistoga, in Napa County, was told to leave - about 5,000 residents - and police stopped all traffic trying to approach the area.\n\nThe Rippeys died on Sunday at their home in Napa, California, where the fast-moving fires trapped them inside. \n\nThe couple's son, Mike Rippey said he and his brother found their parents' remains near each other amid the rubble of their home on Tuesday. \n\n\"We kids would always talk about what it would be like if one of them died and the other was still alive,\"Mr Rippey, 71, told the newspaper. \n\n\"They just couldn't be without each other. The fact that they went together is probably what they would have wanted.\"\n\nThe couple attended the University of Wisconsin and married in 1942 before World War Two took Charles Rippey abroad. \n\nThe Rippeys had five children together and lived in the Napa home for 35 years. \n\nMike Rippey said his father appeared to be heading to his mother's room when he was engulfed in smoke and flames. \n\n\"My father certainly wouldn't have left her,\"he said.\n\nThe fires are among the deadliest in California's history and have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 60 miles (100km) away.\n\nEleven of the deaths have been in Sonoma County, where officials said 530 were still unaccounted for, although that could be due to the chaotic pace of the evacuations. \n\nFamily members and friends of those missing have made appeals on social media to locate their loved ones while authorities have urged missing residents to mark themselves safe on the registry. \n\nSix people have died in Mendocino County, two in Yuba County and two in Napa County, Cal Fire spokeswoman Heather Williams told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn Sonoma County's city of Santa Rosa, a Hilton hotel and a mobile home park were destroyed. Tens of thousands of Sonoma County residents have fled, authorities said.\n\nIn the hills above Santa Rosa, resident Peter Lang was forced to choose between saving his home or more than 1,000 animals that were trapped at his Safari West wildlife preserve, the Press Democrat newspaper reported. \n\nThe 77-year-old owner said he did not lose a single animal, but his home was destroyed. \n\nAt least four wineries have suffered\"total or very significant losses\", Napa Valley Vintners said, with nine others reporting some damage to buildings or vineyards.\n\nMore than 91,000 homes and businesses are without power.\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown declared emergencies in Sonoma, Napa and five other counties.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also approved a disaster declaration, allowing federal emergency aid to be disbursed.\n\nBefore and after\nTL;DR: A couple who recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary are among the 21 dead in some of California's worst-ever wildfires.\n\nArticle: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we do experiments which sometimes throw up genuinely new science.

We know that hospital-acquired infections are a major cause of disease and death in hospitals, with many patients acquiring an infection they didn't have when they went in. Hands, white coats, ties and equipment have all been blamed, but what about beards?\n\nWell, the researchers were surprised to find that it was the clean-shaven staff, and not the beardies, who were more likely to be carrying something unpleasant on their faces. \n\nThe beardless group were more than three times as likely to be harbouring a species known as methicillin-resistant staph aureus on their freshly shaven cheeks. MRSA is a particularly common and troublesome source of hospital-acquired infections because it is resistant to so many of our current antibiotics.\n\nSo what's going on? The researchers suggested that shaving might cause micro-abrasions in the skin\"which may support bacterial colonisation and proliferation\".\n\nPerhaps. But there was another more plausible explanation staring them in the face. That beards fight infection.\n\nUnlikely? Well, driven by curiosity we recently swabbed the beards of a random assortment of men and sent them off to Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist based at University College London, to see what, if anything, he could grow.\n\nAdam managed to grow over 100 different bacteria from our beards, including one that is more commonly found in the small intestine. But, as he quickly explains, that doesn't mean it came from faeces. Such findings are normal and nothing to worry about.\n\nA brief history of beards\n\nFar more interesting, in a few of the petri dishes he noticed that something was clearly killing the other bacteria. The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe.\n\nWe see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics.\n\nPenicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon.\n\nPurifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics.\n\nAs he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years.\n\nAs well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel.\n\nSurprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR:", "test_query": "On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we do experiments which sometimes throw up genuinely new science.

MRSA is a particularly common and troublesome source of hospital-acquired infections because it is resistant to so many of our current antibiotics.\n\nSo what's going on? The researchers suggested that shaving might cause micro-abrasions in the skin\"which may support bacterial colonisation and proliferation\".\n\nPerhaps. But there was another more plausible explanation staring them in the face. That beards fight infection.\n\nUnlikely? Well, driven by curiosity we recently swabbed the beards of a random assortment of men and sent them off to Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist based at University College London, to see what, if anything, he could grow.\n\nAdam managed to grow over 100 different bacteria from our beards, including one that is more commonly found in the small intestine. But, as he quickly explains, that doesn't mean it came from faeces. Such findings are normal and nothing to worry about.\n\nA brief history of beards\n\nFar more interesting, in a few of the petri dishes he noticed that something was clearly killing the other bacteria. The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe.\n\nWe see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics.\n\nPenicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon.\n\nPurifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics.\n\nAs he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years.\n\nAs well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel.\n\nSurprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.", "prediction": "Beards may not be as dirty as they're often made out to be.

It's about making sure the costs of the euro aren't imposed on British taxpayers. \n\n\"And it's about writing that into the law of the land. I think we can do that. And I think that will be absolutely crucial - that deal - to the outcome of the referendum. And we can get the best of both worlds.\"\n\n'Make euro work'\n\nHe denied suggestions from German sources that his renegotiation was a game that the Germans were happy to play along with, saying:\"this deal is going to be absolutely crucial to the outcome of the referendum\".\n\nHe added:\"The deal to be done with countries like Germany or indeed France is this: We'll help you make the euro work better for you and for us, because we suffer when the euro doesn't work. \n\n\"In return, you make sure that Britain's interests are properly respected, that we don't bear the costs and burdens of things that go wrong in the euro, that jobs aren't lost from Britain because we're not in the euro.

He confirmed the changes the government wants to make will require a new EU Treaty. \n\nThere is zero chance of that happening before the British vote, and ministers can't answer how or when it might happen. \n\nAnd for the Chancellor's demands on legal protections for business and the City of London today, it's not clear why other countries will sign up to give equal consideration to Britain's interests, as well as their own - two new challenges on the list, in addition to restricting benefits' migrants, changing the principle of freedom of movement, and getting some powers back for our Parliament.\n\nFor Mr Osborne, who twice today refused to rule out becoming the next Conservative leader, his political future depends on steering the government through this vote, which must happen by the end of 2017. \n\nHe may well be an optimist, but on this, he needs to be right. \n\nRead more from Laura\n\nIn a speech to the BDI, the Federation of German Industries, he said the EU must accept that the single market has more than one currency and that it\"should not discriminate against any business on the basis of the currency of the country in which they reside\".\n\nAnd he added:\"We must never let taxpayers in countries that are not in the euro bear the cost for supporting countries in the eurozone.\"\n\nHe said the the new principles\"must ensure that as the eurozone chooses to integrate it does so in a way that does not damage the interests of non-euro members\".\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wanted Britain to remain a member of the EU but\"in the end the British have to decide\". \n\n\"The only promise we can make is this: Wherever their demands are justified, more competitiveness, more effectiveness in the EU, the British demands are our demands too.\n\n\"Of course we won't be able to agree on everything, we have always found possibilities for opt-outs, and the Europe of today is not a one-speed Europe. \n\n\"For us there are many reasons to keep the UK in the EU and we will do everything we can to make this happen.\"\n\n'Ever-closer union'\n\nAnother crucial demand for the UK is the ability to opt-out of the EU's commitment to\"ever-closer union\"between member states,  which dates back to the 1957 Treaty of Rome.\n\nMr Osborne told German business leaders British people\"do not want to be part of an ever-closer union\".\n\nHe stressed the British government's desire to stay in a reformed EU but added:\"It needs to be a Europe where we are not part of that ever closer union you are more comfortable with.\n\n\"In the UK, where this is widely interpreted as a commitment to ever-closer political integration, that concept is now supported by a tiny proportion of voters.\n\n\"I believe it is this that is the cause of some of the strains between Britain and our European partners.\n\n\"Ever closer union is not right for us any longer.\"\n\n'Publicity stunt'\n\nMr Osborne's visit to Germany comes as the UK government\"steps up the pace\"of renegotiation talks ahead of an in/out referendum promised by the end of 2017.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron will next week set out Britain's demands in full in a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk.\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the chancellor of\"sycophancy\"towards the EU, saying his address to the BDI\"sounded more like a speech from an EU commissioner\".\n\nHe said Mr Osborne had not mentioned the principle of free movement of people, getting back powers from Brussels and reducing the UK's contributions to the EU.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell branded Mr Osborne's trip a\"meaningless publicity stunt\", saying the powers of veto he is demanding already exist.\n\n\"These conditions are all straw men that the chancellor wants to then knock down and claim victory to a home audience,\"he added.\nTL;DR: George Osborne has insisted Britain can get the \"best of both worlds\" out of its EU renegotiation, in an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.\n\nArticle: By Ciara ColhounBBC News NI\n\nWhen she was was born - near the Irish border in County Fermanagh in 1942 - it was not unusual for families to live without electricity and running water.\n\nMargaret's neighbours only began to update their homes in the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBut her family missed the opportunity to join the trend due to her mother's death, when Margaret was 10, and her father's ill health.\n\nNow aged 77, she is one of few elderly people in the UK and Ireland who have lived their entire lives off-grid.\n\n\"I am doing it because I like doing it, not because I'm a hippy, that I think it's new and fashionable,\"she said.\n\n\"My childhood was over at 10. My father took to the bed with severe arthritis, so it never was feasible for us to do anything.\n\n'There were no finances'\n\n\"I didn't have the will, he didn't have the will to do it and there were no finances if we were very keen to do it so it just didn't come onto the radar.\"\n\nMargaret has lived alone in the family's 18th century thatched cottage since her father's death in 1980.\n\nLiving without modern amenities requires physical strength - she must cross a field to collect water in a bucket from a well up to 10 times a day and needs to stoop to cook over an open fire, which she lights every morning from a stack of turf and logs.\n\nHer daily routine begins at 05:30 BST when she heats water in a kettle over the fire for washing and tea - milk and perishables are stored in a wheelie bin. She keeps up-to-date with news on a wind-up radio.\n\nLamps decorate the thick stone windowsills of her tiny two-bedroom home, but paraffin is expensive so Margaret's schedule is governed by daylight - she is usually in bed by 18:30 BST.\n\n'People are entitled to live as they want'\n\nMargaret said her lifestyle meant she grew up with\"the seasons being the master of us all.\"\n\nShe recalled her father taking her outside as a child on Halloween night to gauge the wind direction.\n\nThe prevailing wind would, according to local lore, determine the severity of the winter ahead.\n\nShe loves summer and is less keen on winter when she uses a long fishing pole to push snow off her roof to prevent damage to the thatch.\n\nDespite the difficulties of a cold winter in a house without central heating, Margaret said the compensations of her life could not be overstated.\n\n\"You have the birds in the morning nesting in the house, you have the views, the tranquillity and peace, you have the clock ticking - all those things that you couldn't put a price on,\"she said.\n\n\"I am living the way my forefathers lived, who left the footprint for me. It was good enough for my people, for my parents, my grandparents, who bought the house in 1887 - it is a tribute to them.\"\n\n'I am not going to change for anyone'\n\nMargaret said visitors were often surprised that she does not fit the stereotype of an elderly woman living off-grid.\n\nThey expect to find her, she said,\"sitting in the corner wearing a long black dress and a white apron.\"\n\nInstead, if they take a peek in her bedroom, they will find this sprightly woman likes modern fashion - evident from her long ear rings and the red high-heeled shoes stored beside her bed, bought for the time she received an MBE for community work from the Prince of Wales.\n\n\"I don't know of anyone living like me, without electricity, without running water without any of the amenities. But then I am not interested in how people live. People are entitled to live as they want,\"she said.\n\n\"I am my own person, I have my own identity, this house embodies who I am and what I am. I am not going to change for anyone.\"\n\n'Absolutely no regrets'\n\nWhile she has\"absolutely no regrets\"about her life off-grid, Margaret realises her unusual lifestyle is disappearing.\n\n\"Everyone likes to come and look at this house but if you asked them to stay they couldn't wait to get out of it, particularly younger people,\"she said.\n\nYet, she believes young people could learn from the simplicity of her choices, instead of seeking\"everything big and shiny and better\". \n\nShe said her message to those starting out in life was to\"be aware of who they are and where they come from. Live as they mean to go on\". \n\n\"Be content with what you have,\"she added.\n\nAs she approaches 80, and following a serious accident eight years ago, Margaret fears she may not always be fit for the physical demands of living off-grid.\n\n\"I loved everything I did.

It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\"\n\nMr Trump Jr said the lawyer then changed the subject to the Magnitsky Act and\"it became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along\".\n\nAdopted by Congress in 2012, the Magnitsky Act allows the US to withhold visas and freeze financial assets of Russian officials thought to have been involved in human rights violations.\n\nMs Veselnitskaya is married to a Moscow government official and her clients include companies and individuals said to be close to the Kremlin. She has been at the forefront of a campaign - backed by the Russian state - to overturn the act.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Mr Goldstone backed Mr Trump Jr's version of the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered\"just a vague, generic statement about the campaign's funding\"which was\"the most inane nonsense I've ever heard\".\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump Jr tweeted sarcastically:\"Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent...\"He also denied issuing conflicting statements.\n\nA spokesman for President Trump's legal team said the president was\"not aware of and did not attend\"the meeting.\n\nAnalysis: A grim situation for Trump Jr\n\nAnthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter \n\nWhether by plan or happenstance, Donald Trump Jr is stumbling into an increasingly dire situation.\n\nThe pattern has been set. The New York Times runs a story, Trump Jr issues his response, then the noose tightens. \n\nFirst he said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was about adoption issues. Then the Times reports that Trump Jr thought he would learn damaging information about Hillary Clinton. \n\nThe presidential son says he was conducting routine opposition research. Then the Times reports that he was told it was the Russian government itself that was coming to his father's aid.\n\nIn a traditional campaign, a foreign government's attempt to offer incriminating information about an opponent - or even the hint of such an overture - would set off all kinds of alarms. The FBI would have been notified. Senior staff would have insulated themselves from incrimination.\n\nThe Trump team was not a conventional campaign. And time and time again, it made novice mistakes or, more ominously, took unprecedented risks. \n\nIts candidate prevailed, but it has led to countless political headaches. Now it appears the president's own family, and his presidency itself, could be in peril. They have only themselves to blame.\n\nRead more from Anthony\n\nWhy is Russia the focus of US investigations?\n\nIt is alleged that Russian hackers stole information linked to the Clinton campaign and passed it to Wikileaks so it could be released and help tip the election towards Mr Trump.\n\nCongressional committees and a special prosecutor are investigating whether there was any collusion between the Trump team and the Russians.\n\nThe investigations have yet to reveal any evidence of collusion, something the president has always denied.\n\nLast week Mr Trump said interference in the election\"could well have been\"carried out by countries other than Russia and interference\"has been happening for a long time\".\nTL;DR: The Russian lawyer at the centre of allegations surrounding US President Donald Trump's son has insisted she was never in possession of information that could have damaged Hillary Clinton.\n\nArticle: The defence secretary told MPs that levels of violence had fallen in some areas and recruitment of Afghan army and police officers was on target.\n\nSome of the 10,000 UK personnel could come home this year if\"conditions on the ground\"were suitable, he added.\n\nBut he warned casualties could increase in the future and he was\"concerned\"about levels of corruption in Kabul.\n\nThe government has said it wants UK combat troops to leave Afghanistan by 2015.\n\n'Taking the fight'\n\nIn his quarterly update to Parliament on the UK's mission - part of the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force - Dr Fox said the challenge was to have the\"patience and will to see it through\".\n\nThe deaths of two personnel on Monday - following a fire at the Camp Bastion base - were a reminder of the daily sacrifices the country's armed forces were making but he insisted the mission continued to be vital to protecting UK national security.\n\nDr Fox said there were some encouraging signs of progress in Helmand Province - the region of southern Afghanistan where the bulk of British troops are stationed.\n\nWhile troops were\"taking the fight\"to insurgents, the number of\"security incidents\"in certain areas had fallen from as many as 25 a day to just a handful.\n\n\"It is fragile and not irreversible but it is progress,\"he said.\n\nBut he warned that\"2011 will be just as difficult as 2010\"and the number of British casualties was set to rise as the weather improved and insurgent numbers rose after the winter.\n\nWhile the Afghan government was on track to meet an October target for recruitment of new army and police officers, he said reports of corruption at Kabul Bank - the country's largest private bank - and in other institutions continued to be of real concern.\n\nShadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said Labour continued to support the government's policy in Afghanistan but former foreign secretary David Miliband expressed concern about levels of violence and a lack of headway in getting regional backing for improved security and governance.\nTL;DR: Liam Fox has said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the progress that UK troops are making in Afghanistan. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Helen  BriggsBBC News\n\nThe chick lived 127 million years ago and belonged to a group of primitive birds that shared the planet with the dinosaurs.\n\nFossils of birds from this time period are rare, with baby fossils seen as\"the rarest of the rare\".\n\nScientists say the discovery gives a peek into the lives of the ancient, long-extinct birds that lived between 250 and 66 million years ago.\n\nThe bird belonged to the enantiornithine family, most of which had teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds. \n\n\"It's amazing to realise that many of the features we see among living birds had already been developed more than 100 million years ago,\"said Luis Chiappe, from the LA Museum of Natural History.\n\nMinute matter\n\nFrom nose to tail the hatchling was a bit shorter than the little finger of a human hand, and it weighed just 10 grams.\n\nThe bird died not long after leaving the egg, giving a window into a critical stage of development. \n\nResearchers from the UK, Spain, Sweden and the US used state-of-the-art technology to study its fossilised bones.\n\nAnalysis in a synchrotron - particle accelerators that use very intense light to study minute matter - revealed that the chick probably could not not fly at this stage.\n\nThe cartilage in its sternum (breast bone in the centre of the chest) had not yet fully turned to bone.\n\nLead researcher Fabien Knoll of ARAID-Dinopolis and the University of Manchester said analysis of bone development can be used to study a host of evolutionary characteristics.\n\n\"New technologies are offering palaeontologists unprecedented capacities to investigate fossils,\"he said. \n\nThe fossil was found many years ago in the famous Las Hoyas site in Spain. However, it has remained largely unstudied until now.\n\n\"Truth be told, the techniques we used to analyse it in the paper (such as synchrotron microtomography and elemental mapping) had not yet been developed when the specimen was discovered,\"said Dr Knoll. \n\nStudying the process of bone development can explain a lot about a young bird's life and development. These early bird chicks may have been much like modern chickens, which have feathers and can move around from birth. \n\nOr they might have been more similar to living love birds, which hatch with no feathers and their eyes shut, meaning they need parental care.\n\nThe research, published in the journal, Nature Communications, suggests the enantiornithines were very diverse in their behaviour and development.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Scientists have unveiled one of the smallest bird fossils ever discovered.\n\nArticle: Ribble Valley MP and Deputy Commons Speaker Nigel Evans, 53, has won praise from gay MPs from other parties for his decision to back the group ParliOut.\n\nSwansea-born, he stood twice in Welsh seats before landing the Lancashire constituency he has held since 1992.\n\nRhondda MP Chris Bryant, who is also gay, welcomed the decision.\n\nMr Bryant, who sits on the board of ParliOut, tweeted:\"Glad to see Nigel Evans is'coming out'.

The Maggi promotional campaign, moreover, was among the first to recognise the changing profile of middle-class women in metropolitan India.\n\nNestle has had a long relationship with India that goes back to 1912, when it launched in the country as The Nestle Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company (Export). \n\nMilkmaid, a sweetened condensed milk, was the brand that the company soon became synonymous with. Its 400g can hasn't changed over the century, although the packaging has become slicker.\n\nAfter India's Independence - 1947, incidentally, was the year when Nestle acquired Maggi - the company was quick to recognise the new government's emphasis on local production and formed its Indian subsidiary in 1961, setting up its first factory at Moga in Punjab state. \n\nThe choice of the location was also government-dictated because the then dispensation, steered by the socialist idealism of India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, wanted Nestle to develop the milk economy of Punjab. \n\nMaggi travelled across India on the back of this formidable legacy and soon it was everywhere. Within its first 25 years, it was able to command 90% of the quick noodles market it had created. \n\nUnsurprisingly, when the brand launched the Me and Meri Maggi campaign (Me and My Maggi campaign) in its silver jubilee year in 2008, inviting people to send in their personal Maggi stories, its advertising agency Publicis Capital was deluged with more than 30,000 entries.\n\nIt was a testimony to the deep inroads Maggi had made into the everyday lives of its loyal customers. \n\nIndia today is the biggest market for Maggi noodles in the world, despite the serious challenge mounted on the brand by rival Top Ramen in the 1990s. \n\nAnd Maggi, along with the buffet of complementary products - soup mixes, sauces and cup noodles - contributes more than 20% of Nestle India's revenue, clocking around 15bn rupees ($235m; \u00a3149m) in annual sales. Just last year, a leading survey re-affirmed what everybody knew already: Maggi was the country's most trusted food brand.\n\nThe BusinessWeek magazine commented with considerable insight in 2006:\"Maggi has managed to enter Indian homes to change the traditional food habits of Indian children on its promise of convenience. This brand has understood the psychology of Indian mothers and positioned itself for mother-child indulgence.\"\n\n'Maggi entrepreneurs'\n\nPriced at 12 rupees (18 cents; 12 pence) a serving, and with three generations of Indians growing up with it, Maggi was able to transcend all age and economic divides. \n\nIt spawned legions of Maggi\"entrepreneurs\"who have been selling instant noodles to office-goers and college students with nothing more than a pressure stove, cheap aluminium utensils, and stainless steel crockery and cutlery at their command. \n\nPopular hangouts such as Jaipur's Tapri restaurant, which began as a\"Maggi joint\"started by two MBA graduates, serve Maggi in a dozen innovative ways. A lot goes on over a piping hot bowl of Maggi.\n\nFarzi Cafe, restaurateur Zorawar Kalra's hugely successful venture at India's first\"food mall\", in Delhi's suburb of Gurgaon, used to serve Maggi with foie gras.\n\nIndia banned the import of foie gras last year following protests by animal rights activists that the method used to produce the French delicacy by force-feeding ducks and geese, was cruel.\n\n\"I must say I fell in love with it - before the government banned foie gras. It's ironic that the other half of this delectable dish, Maggi, is also heading towards a nationwide ban,\"Zorawar Kalra says.\n\nMoments before the 15-day ban on the noodles came into effect in Delhi on Wednesday, a popular business news channel anchor plastered Facebook with pictures of her and her colleagues wolfing down their\"last bowl of Maggi\". \n\nThere was a sense of loss and longing in her post, and it encapsulated the feelings of most Indians who have grown up with Maggi. \n\nCooking with Maggi\n\nFor years, many Indians have considered Maggi to be junk food and most schools in Delhi do not stock the snack in their canteens. Parents who give Maggi products to children in their lunchboxes have been sent polite notes advising them against doing so.\n\nBut as the sales show, millions of Indians buy and consume Maggi daily and a quick search on Google shows lots of different ways, including some rather strange ones, in which people cook and consume the snack.\n\nWell known food writer Tarla Dalal offers recipes to make samosa patties stuffed with cooked Maggi, cheese and vegetables; deep fried Maggi-cheese-vegetable fritters; and adding cooked noodles with cheese and herbs to make open toast sandwiches. \n\nThere are also recipes for making Maggi-omelettes and vegetable soups with Maggi.\n\nBut the snack achieved cult status in India mainly because of the ease of cooking it - Maggi's\"two-minute\"advertising campaign suggested just opening the pack and adding the noodles and seasoning to boiling hot water and cooking it for just two minutes.\n\nAnd that is just how most Indians like to eat what are often described as\"India's favourite noodles\".\n\nThe writer is a columnist with Mail Today and a blogger at www.indianrestaurantspy.com\nTL;DR: India has ordered tests on Maggi noodles after some were found to contain high levels of lead. They have been temporarily banned from sale in Delhi and some grocery chains have taken them off their shelves. Nestle India denies its products are unsafe.

The 500 delegates come from more than 30 countries.\n\nTheir wide interests illustrate the complex and difficult issues arising from global livestock production.\n\n'Catastrophic impacts'\n\nThe two-day conference is being organised by Compassion in World Farming (CiWF). \n\nThe campaigning organisation warns that\"there will be catastrophic impacts for life on Earth unless there is a global move away from intensive farming\".\n\nThe world is on track to lose two-thirds of its wildlife by the end of this decade, largely because habitats have been destroyed to produce food for humans. \n\nThere has been a rise in so-called\"superbugs\"linked to the use of antibiotics in farmed animals. And methane emissions from livestock have made a significant contribution to climate change.\n\nCiWF CEO Philip Lymbery said:\"Livestock production, the environment, wildlife conservation and human health are all interlinked, so it's vital that experts from each of these fields work together to come up with practical solutions to stop this before it's too late.\"\n\nCiWF believes that there should be a total rethink of food and farming policies, enshrined in the framework of a UN Convention. \n\nThe aim would be to properly integrate objectives such as food security, climate change, animal welfare and human health - so one isn't pursued at the expense of the other. \n\nMr Lymbery added:\"Many people are aware that wild animals such as penguins, elephants and jaguars are threatened by extinction. However, few know that livestock production, fuelled by consumer demand for cheap meat, is one of the biggest drivers of species extinction and biodiversity loss on the planet.\"\n\nAward-winning writer and activist Raj Patel from the University of Texas is speaking at the conference. \n\nHe said:\"The footprint of global agriculture is vast. Industrial agriculture is absolutely responsible for driving deforestation, absolutely responsible for pushing industrial monoculture, and that means it is responsible for species loss.\n\n\"We're losing species we have never heard of, those we've yet to put a name to and industrial agriculture is very much at the spear-tip of that. Conferences are for forging the alliances and building the movement that will change the world.\"\n\nAlso attending is Martin Palmer, secretary-general of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation. \n\nHe said:\"Our current food system is not about a healthy, sustainable world of food but about excess, greed and foolishness disguised as'market forces'. \n\n\"It treats the natural world not as something we are part of and therefore should treasure, but as a larder we can raid and somehow hope it gets filled again.\n\n\"But the truth is, it won't! As a result of this conference I would hope that all the key players - including the great faiths - would find a place at the table and together, each in their own distinctive way, will be able to inspire and guide us towards a better, fairer world.\"\nTL;DR: Can farming and food production be made less damaging to the planet?\n\nArticle: Along with his family, he was uprooted from Monmouth in south Wales to Germany, where his father Colonel Walter Brook, was tasked with helping re-build the devastated country post World War Two. \n\nYoung Kim, along with his older siblings, was told\"not to be friendly\"with the Germans, and that they were\"different\". \n\nBut, ignoring orders, he soon began having snowball fights and making friends. \n\nHis parents too, rebuked orders, refusing to requisition a house from a German family, and instead deciding to share it with them. \n\nThe family story was recorded by Kim's son, Rhidian Brook, in a novel The Aftermath, published in 2013.\n\nIt has now been released as a film, with actress Keira Knightley starring as Rachel, a character loosely inspired by Kim's late mother, Anthea. \n\n\"I am very proud of my son, Rhidian, for writing this story and recording our family history,\"said Kim, now 80 and living in Brecon.\n\n\"But I am also so proud of my parents.\n\n\"They had a Welsh heritage and they took this welcoming and generous spirit with them to Germany.\"\n\nMuch of the book and film focuses on the character of Kim's dad Walter - Lewis in the film. \n\nBorn in 1895, Walter grew up on a farm near Presteigne, Powys.\n\nHe was stationed in Egypt and Arabia during World War One, becoming friends with T.E Lawrence - Lawrence of Arabia - who impressed Walter with the way he managed to unite the Arabs. \n\nDuring World War Two, Walter was then tasked with contributing to the rebuilding of government in Germany once the war was over.\n\nKim said:\"I remember he sent home lots of letters and photos.\n\n\"I also saw pictures in weekly magazines of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, so I knew a bit of what to expect.\"\n\nStill, arriving in Hamburg - recently completely destroyed by a strategic bombing campaign by the Allies - was a shock.\n\n\"I recall meeting with dad, then being driven through miles of ruins,\"he said.\n\n\"There was literally nothing standing, and lots of the ruins had black crosses on them, marking the dead bodies. \n\n\"The desperation and starvation was in your face.\"\n\nAs the Allies were determined no former Nazis were going to be in positions of responsibility, Walter was installed as Governor to Pinneburg, a district just west of the city of Hamburg. \n\nHe was given use of a local mansion, but instead of ordering the German owners to leave, instead opted to share the property with businessman Wilhelm Ladiges, his wife Erika, daughter Heike, seven, and sons Theo, 12 and Holger, five.\n\nThe Ladiges had the first floor and the Brooks the ground floor, but both families shared a kitchen in the basement. \n\nKim recalls:\"We were told not to really talk to the Ladiges, even though they had been as anti-Hitler as anyone dared during the war.\n\n\"We were meant to display dignified curtness, but it was an extremely cold winter, so we wanted to have snowball fights.\n\n\"I soon learnt German and began to play with Heike in the countryside.

oenophiles, cultural commentators, flag-wavers for French exceptionalism - all of whom have watched with consternation the gradual disappearance of wine from the national dinner table. \n\nRecent figures merely confirm what has been observed for years, that the number of regular drinkers of wine in France is in freefall.\n\nIn 1980 more than half of adults were consuming wine on a near-daily basis. Today that figure has fallen to 17%.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of French people who never drink wine at all has doubled to 38%.\n\nIn 1965, the amount of wine consumed per head of population was 160 litres a year. In 2010 that had fallen to 57 litres, and will most likely dip to no more than 30 litres in the years ahead.\n\nAt dinner, wine is the third most popular drink after tap and bottled water. Sodas and fruit juices are catching up fast and are now just a short way behind.\n\nAccording to a recent study in the International Journal of Entrepreneurship, changes in French drinking habits are clearly visible through the attitudes of successive generations.\n\nPeople in their 60s and 70s grew up with wine on the table at every meal. For them, wine remains an essential part of their patrimoine, or cultural heritage.\n\nThe middle generation - now in their 40s and 50s - sees wine as a more occasional indulgence. They compensate for declining consumption by spending more money. They like to think they drink less but better. \n\nMembers of the third generation - the internet generation - do not even start taking an interest in wine until their mid-to-late 20s. For them, wine is a product like any other, and they need persuading that it is worth their money.\n\n\"What has happened is a progressive erosion of wine's identity, and of its sacred and imaginary representations,\"say the report's authors, Thierry Lorey and Pascal Poutet.\n\n\"Over three generations, this has led to the changes in France's habits of consumption and the steep declines in the volume of wine that is drunk.\"\n\nThe fall in consumption is mirrored in other countries - such as Italy and Spain - which are also historic producers of wine. And it has not dented the prospects for exports of French wine, which continues to hold its own abroad.\n\nBut what worries people are the effects of the change on life inside France, on French civilisation.\n\nThey fear that time-honoured French values - conviviality, tradition and appreciation of the good things in life - are on the way out. Taking their place is a utilitarian,\"hygieno-moralistic\"new order, cynically purveyed by an alliance of politics, media and global business.\n\n\"Wine is not some trophy product that we roll out to celebrate the grand occasions or to show off our social status. It is a table drink intended to accompany the meal and provide a complement to whatever is on our plate,\"says food writer Perico Legasse.\n\n\"Wine is an element in the meal. But what has happened is that it's gone from being popular to elitist. It is totally ridiculous. It should be perfectly possible to drink moderately of good quality wine on a daily basis.\"\n\nFor Legasse, part of the fault is a changing national approach to food and gastronomy as a whole.\n\n\"For many years people have been steadily abandoning what in our French sociology we referred to as the repas, or meal, by which I mean a convivial gathering around a table, and not the individualised, accelerated version we see today. \n\n\"The traditional family meal is withering away. Instead we have a purely technical form of nourishment, whose aim is to make sure we fuel up as effectively and as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWine drinking in France is certainly part of a long-standing way of life, but it would be wrong to suppose that the French have always drunk as much as they did, say, 50 years ago.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, wine was commonly drunk (at least in wine-growing areas), but it was a weak concoction and popular mainly because - unlike water - it was safe. \n\nThe Revolution of 1789 dispelled the aristocratic image that wine had, by then, acquired, and the economic changes of 19th Century helped it permeate society.\n\nDenis Saverot, editor of La Revue des Vins de France magazine, says the rise of wine mirrored the rise of the working class. But it was the war of 1914-18 that really secured its position in the hearts of the French.\n\n\"Basically the soldiers went over the top pickled on pinard, the strong, low-quality wine which was supplied in bulk. Up until then the Normans, the Bretons, the people of Picardy and the north, they had never touched wine. But they learned in the trenches. \n\n\"After that in France we generalised the consumption of cheap wine so that by the 1950s there were drinking outlets, cafes and bars, everywhere. Tiny villages would have five or six. But that was the high point. The decline in consumption goes back to the 1960s.\"\n\nEveryone agrees on the main factors. Fewer people work outdoors, so the fortifying qualities of wine are less in demand. Offices require people to stay awake, so lunchtimes are, by and large, dry.\n\nThen there is the rise of the car (\"wine's worst enemy\"for Saverot), changing demographics, with France's large Muslim minority, and the growing popularity of beers and mixers.\n\nBut Saverot has another target in his sights.\n\n\"It is our bourgeois, technocratic elite with their campaigns against drink-driving and alcoholism, lumping wine in with every other type of alcohol, even though it should be regarded as totally different,\"he says. \n\n\"Recently I heard one senior health official saying that wine causes cancer'from the very first glass'. That coming from a Frenchman. I was flabbergasted. In hock with the health lobby and the politically correct, our elites prefer to keep the country on chemical anti-depressants and wean us off wine.\n\n\"Just look at the figures. In the 1960s, we were drinking 160 litres each a year and weren't taking any pills. Today we consume 80 million packets of anti-depressants, and wine sales are collapsing. Wine is the subtlest, most civilised, most noble of anti-depressants. But look at our villages. The village bar has gone, replaced by a pharmacy.\"\n\nVeteran observer of his nation's way of life, Oxford-based French writer Theodore Zeldin agrees that a business-style culture has made huge inroads into France - the bane of all those who prefer to take the time to savour things. \n\n\"Companionship has been replaced by networking. Business means busy-ness, and in that way we are becoming like everywhere else,\"he says.\n\nBut Zeldin refuses to abandon hope.\n\n\"The old French art de vivre is still there. It's an ideal. It's a bit like the ideal of an English gentleman. You don't often find an English gentleman, but the ideal is there and it informs society as a whole,\"he says.\n\n\"It is the same with our art de vivre. Of course times have changed, but it still survives. It is that feeling you get in France that in human relations we need to do more than just conduct business. We have a duty to entertain, to converse. And in France - thanks to our education system - we still have that ability to converse in a general, universalist way that has been lost elsewhere. \n\n\"That is the art de vivre. It is about taking your time. And wine is part of it, because with wine you have to take your time.\n\n\"After all, that is one of the great things about wine. You can't swig it.\"\n\nYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook\nTL;DR: Does the seemingly perpetual decline in consumption of France's national drink symbolise a corresponding decline in French civilisation?\n\nArticle: Nine Aberdeen City councillors were suspended in 2017 after they disobeyed former leader Kezia Dugdale's instructions not to form a coalition with the Conservatives.\n\nThe coalition came about after the last local government election.\n\nThe group were referred to the party's national constitutional committee to have their membership considered. \n\nScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the decision sent out a clear message that\"serious rule breaches will result in serious repercussions\". \n\n\"It is disappointing that the nine councillors in three and a half years have offered neither regret nor a resolution to avoid this decision,\"he added. \n\n\"I have expressed my frustration before that this case has taken so long to be brought to a conclusion.

Now his pension is at risk.\n\nFor Mr Miller's bosses, however, fortunes look brighter. \n\nVeteran journalist Michelle Celarier has estimated that longtime Sears chairman and former chief executive Eddie Lampert has made nearly $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) off his investment in the company, thanks to performance fees, dividends and other payments.\n\nMeanwhile, its top 340 executives were collectively granted a potential $25m in bonuses in December, just months after the firm declared bankruptcy.\n\n\"It's utterly ridiculous to me,\"says Mr Miller, who is now relying on odd jobs to help pay bills.\"How can you reward somebody for driving a business into the ground?\"\n\n'The real story'\n\nLaments like Mr Miller's have surfaced repeatedly in recent years, amid a wave of bankruptcies in the US retail sector that has claimed household names such as Toys R Us, Payless Shoe Source and Nine West.\n\nMuch of the blame has focused on the disruption caused by online shopping. \n\nBut analysts say many of the firms have another feature in common: investors who took control of the retailers, loaded them with debt, and extracted fees, dividends and other assets for their own benefit.\n\nSears, for example, spent millions purchasing its own stock - inflating prices in a win for shareholders such as Mr Lampert, who became chair of the firm in 2005, after arranging its merger with Kmart.\n\nSears later borrowed more than $2bn from his hedge fund, ESL Investments, as it struggled to remain in operation. \n\nIt also sold off parts of the business, including hundreds of properties and the mail-order catalogue Lands End, to companies affiliated with Mr Lampert.\n\nSears is now a shadow of its former self, having closed almost 3,000 stores and cut more than 250,000 jobs since 2007. \n\nEileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, says those deals limited Sears' ability to invest in the future - just as the need to compete with online shopping made those investments critical.\n\nThat is a pattern seen repeatedly in the recent retail failings, she said.\n\n\"They want to blame everything that happens on Amazon,\"she says.\"The fact that they have starved these organisations of resources... that's the real story.\"\n\n'Years-long scheme'\n\nESL has defended its actions, saying\"all transactions were done in good faith, on fair terms\" in order to keep Sears in business.\n\nIt said it was confident that its process for reviewing deals for conflicts of interest was\"unimpeachable\".\n\nThe firm is now offering to buy Sears out of bankruptcy for $5.2bn.  \n\nThe plan could keep 425 stores open and retain up to 45,000 jobs. \n\nBut several groups owed money have asked the court to reject the proposal, which is funded in part by forgiving some debt owed to his hedge fund. \n\nThey cite concerns like those of Ms Appelbaum and Mr Miller's.\n\n\"ESL's current bid to'save' the company is nothing but the final fulfilment of a years-long scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's and ESL's own pockets,\"attorneys for a group of unsecured creditors wrote.\n\n'Apply pressure'\n\nOutside court, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has weighed in with similar questions, as have Sears workers.\n\nAt a rally in New York this month, they accused Mr Lampert of driving the firm to failure and asked the court to require that money be set aside for workers in the event of future layoffs, among other demands. \n\n\"We want to apply pressure in a big way,\"Mr Miller says.\"Somebody's going to have to say,'Hey, wait a minute, we've got to fix this situation.'\"\n\nA similar campaign by Toys R Us workers last summer successfully shamed former private equity owners KKR and Bain Capital into creating a $20m severance fund.\n\nBut that was an exception, contingent on those firms' largesse.\n\nAnalysts said bankruptcy judges are often reluctant to challenge plans that would keep a business open - even in cases with as many potential conflicts of interest as Sears. \n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has taken a hands-off regulatory approach, even as issuance of loans to firms with weak credit soars to record levels, driven by strong investor demand for debt.\n\nCarrie Gleason, who helped organise the worker campaigns as a policy director for Organization United for Respect, says the Toys R Us bankruptcy marked a\"breaking point\"for broader awareness of the way business strategies contributed to retailer failings.\n\nBut with retail's struggles expected to continue, more pressure is needed to bring change, Ms Gleason says.\n\n\"This is not going to be the last [bankruptcy],\"she says. \n\n\"They're going to keep coming and ultimately what we need are some new protections.\"\nTL;DR: As a wave of bankruptcies hits the retail sector,

missile defence system.\n\nSo which countries have imposed bans and where does that leave Turkey to buy its weapons from?\n\nWho has imposed bans?\n\nNine European countries have imposed controls on arms sales to Turkey.\n\nThe Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK have all - along with Canada - announced they are halting or restricting arms export licence approvals for Turkey.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said Britain would continue selling arms to Turkey but would not grant new export licences for weapons which might be used in military operations in Syria.\n\nGermany and Spain have said that their embargoes only apply to new contracts.\n\nThe European Union has not endorsed an official EU-wide arms embargo, although foreign ministers have agreed to adopt\"strong national positions regarding their arms export policy to Turkey\".\n\n\"The arms sanctions are not expected to have a great effect, if any, on Ankara's operation should it continue,\"says defence analyst Yvonni-Stefania Efstathiou.\n\nBut\"should sanctions extend beyond weapons potentially used in Syria\", she says,\"there could be a negative impact on Turkey's overall defence industry\". \n\nWho are the major arms suppliers to Turkey?\n\nOver the period 1991-2017, Turkey was the world's fifth largest importer of major weapons.\n\nTurkey has historically relied on its Nato allies in the United States and Europe for its defence and security needs.\n\nThe US has been the largest exporter of arms to Turkey, providing 60% of its total imports between 2014 and 2018.\n\nAmong European countries, France, Spain and the UK have been major suppliers. \n\nUnder the military-dominated Turkish governments of the 1980s and 90s, its arms imports from the US reached record highs.\n\nIt acquired fighter jets, missiles, helicopters, tanks, ships, and other items which are still used by the Turkish military.\n\nBut Turkey recently turned to Russia for the purchase of a $2.5bn missile defence system, a decision that has alarmed its Nato allies.\n\nThey argued that Turkey's acquisition of S-400 system from a Nato adversary could greatly undermine its security because Turkish military forces are integrated into Nato's equipment and broader air defence systems. \n\nThe United States responded by preventing Turkey from buying its F-35 stealth warplanes, the most sophisticated fighter jet in the world.\n\nBecause of its key geostrategic location, Turkey hosts several US and Nato bases, including an early warning missile defence radar and Nato command operations in eastern Turkey.\n\nIt also houses roughly 50 US nuclear bombs in the Incirlik airbase near the southern Turkish city of Adana. \n\nTurkey's own weapons industry \n\nTurkey has developed its own substantial domestic arms industry in the last decade with the aim of reducing its dependence on foreign suppliers.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu recently stated that Turkey\"now produces over 70%\"of its own military equipment and is also a significant exporter of arms.\n\n\"It is not easy to assess precisely the extent to which Turkey's defence industry is meeting the national military needs,\"says defence analyst Yvonni-Stefania Efstathiou.\n\n\"Yet what Turkey usually calls indigenous systems are, in reality, licence-produced or based on imported sub-components.\"\n\nTurkish arms exports during the period 2014-18 had increased by 170% compared with the period from 2009-13. \n\nBy 2018, Turkey was the 14th largest arms exporter in the world

\n\nChairman Jac Nasser said BHP now believed the period of weaker prices and higher volatility would be prolonged. \n\nThe decision to cut the dividend had not been made lightly but was a\"determined response to changing markets\", he said.\n\nThe size of the dividend cut was worse than analysts had expected. \n\nShares rise\n\nShaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor said:\"Given months of anguish and market debate regarding the dividend, we expect that 16 cents while disappointing, is a cashflow positive and therefore will likely be absorbed by the market.\"\n\nAfter an initial fall, shares in BHP Billiton rose 2.7% to $17.64 in late morning trading in Sydney but have fallen 47% in the past 12 moths.\n\nThe company pledged to pay a minimum of 50% of underlying profits in dividends in the future.\n\nMr O'Connor commented: \"While the [profits] miss looks big in percentage terms, the numbers are quite frankly disappointingly low anyway.\"\n\nChief executive Andrew Mackenzie said:\"With improved financial flexibility and a portfolio of high-return growth options, we are well positioned to grow.\"\n\nMining companies such as BHP have been under intense pressure as a slowdown in China's economy results in lower demand for key commodities, such as iron ore and coal.\n\nBHP also revealed a new operating model with fewer layers that aimed to create a more agile

tax for costs associated with the November collapse of a dam at the BHP-owned Samarco mine in Brazil that killed at least 17 people.\n\nMr Mackenzie said:\"Supporting the response efforts, rebuilding communities and restoring the environment impacted by the dam failure remains a priority and substantial progress has been made.\"\n\nDean Dalla Valle has been assigned to lead BHP's response to the incident and will be based in Brazil. The executive will retain responsibility for the Jansen Potash project in Canada.\n\nBHP Billiton is one of the world's largest producers of major commodities including iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and uranium, and has substantial interests in both conventional and shale oil and gas and energy coal.\n\nBHP was founded in the mid-1800s in Australia, while Billiton's roots can be traced back to a tin mine in Indonesia in 1851. The Anglo-Dutch company merged with BHP in 2001 to form a global mining giant.\n\nHowever, that merger was partly undone last year when it spun off some smaller assets, including aluminium, nickel and manganese, into a new company called South32. \n\nSince listing in Sydney last June, its shares have fallen by 40% to A$1.22.\nTL;DR: Mining giant BHP Billiton has posted a huge half-year net loss of $5.67bn (\u00a34bn) and warned that weak commodity prices will continue.\n\nArticle: A customer's snapshots of Owens bagging groceries in New Jersey were published by the Daily Mail and Fox News, leading to accusations of\"job-shaming\".\n\nActors and celebrities rushed to defend the actor, which Owens told ABC was\"really overwhelming, in a good way\".\n\nFilmmaker Tyler Perry tweeted a job offer to him after the interview aired.\n\n\"I feel like I'm more of a celebrity now than I've ever been.

So reductions in those crops are potentially quite worrisome in terms of increasing those deficiencies,\"said Dr Myers.\n\nEating more food to make up for these reductions in nutrients would not be a good solution, he said. \n\n\"The problem with that is that if you eat 5-10% more calories every day it would be a matter of months before we were morbidly obese and bumping into issues around metabolic diseases.\"\n\nThe scientists are unsure of the mechanism through which levels of carbon dioxide of around 550 parts per million limit crop nutrition. \n\nIt had been thought that crops would substitute carbohydrates for nutrients as the gas increased. But the new research was inconsistent on this point.\n\nBreeding difficulties\n\nThe authors did find that within some species such as rice, there are considerable differences in response to CO2 which gives them hope to overcome these reductions. \n\n\"What we speculate is that this could produce a basis for breeding programmes to produce rice that was less sensitive to CO2. We are not proving that this is possible but we are just saying there may be a genetic basis for doing it,\"said Dr Myers. \n\n\"These breeding programmes all sound good on paper but you can produce a cultivar and the yield is reduced or it just doesn't taste good. It's complicated.\"\n\nThe impact of carbon on nutrient levels is another blow to global food production. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), crop yields are also set to suffer as a result of rising temperatures. \n\nTheir recent summary on the impacts of global warming stated that the production of maize, wheat and rice will go down over the course of this century.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Rising levels of CO2 around the world will significantly impact the nutrient content of crops according to a new study.\n\nArticle: Finland was named the best place to be a mother, with Sweden and Norway following in second and third places.\n\nThe charity compared factors such as maternal health, child mortality, education and income in 176 countries. \n\nIn India, over 300,000 babies die within 24 hours of being born, accounting for 29% of all newborn deaths worldwide, the report says.\n\nThe 10 bottom-ranked countries were all from sub-Saharan Africa, with one woman in 30 dying from pregnancy-related causes on average and one child in seven dying before his or her fifth birthday.\n\nIn DR Congo, war and poverty have left mothers malnourished and unsupported at the most vulnerable time of their lives.\n\nThe next worst countries listed were Somalia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger, Central African Republic, The Gambia, Nigeria, Chad and Ivory Coast.\n\nThe charity says that lack of nutrition is key to high mother and infant mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa, with 10-20% of mothers underweight.\n\nIn contrast, the results show that Finland is the best place to be a mother, with the risk of death through pregnancy one in 12,200 and Finnish children getting almost 17 years of formal education.\n\nSweden, Norway, Iceland and The Netherlands were also in the top 10, with the US trailing at 30.\n\nSurprisingly, the report found that the US has the highest death rate in newborns in the industrialised world, with 11,300 babies dying on the day they are born each year.\n\nThe charity says this is due in part to the US's large population, as well as the high number of babies born too early. The US has one of the highest preterm birth rates in the world at a rate of one in eight.\n\nThe report also found that mothers and babies die in greater numbers in South Asia than in any other region with an estimated 423,000 babies dying on the day they are born each year.\n\nIndia also has more maternal deaths than in any other country with 56,000 per year.\n\n\"In India... economic growth has been impressive but the benefits have been shared unequally,\"the report says.\nTL;DR: The Democratic Republic of Congo is the world's toughest place to raise children, Save the Children  reports .\n\nArticle: By Joshua CheethamBBC News\n\nOne option being touted is to allow people to slightly expand the\"social bubbles\"- meaning they'd be able to see a select few friends and family.\n\nAccording to a memo leaked to local media, authorities in Belgium were considering allowing residents to gather with 10 other people of their choice every weekend.\n\nTo close the network of possible infection, every member of the group would have to include the other nine people in their top 10. And once chosen, each person would be banned from meeting with anyone outside of their preferred 10.   \n\nIt's unclear how this would be policed. For some, it could also create a new social nightmare - who do you pick? And what if the person you choose for your top 10 doesn't include you in theirs?\n\nThis idea was not included when Belgium announced its latest measures for lockdown easing on Saturday, but other countries are pondering similar moves.\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland last week she was considering expanding the definition of\"households\"to allow small gatherings of people,\"encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody else who is on their own, or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people\".\n\nMeanwhile New Zealand, one of the earliest adopters of lockdown measures, has settled on an expansion policy. From next week, New Zealanders will be free to slightly extend their bubbles of contact to include close family, caregivers and those living in isolation - so long as they are living in the same town or city.\n\nThe country has seen a steady decline in new coronavirus cases in recent weeks. To date, it has had 18 deaths and 1,470 confirmed cases.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also been praised for her compassionate public messaging during the outbreak, addressing the impact of lockdown on people's social lives and mental wellbeing.\n\nBut while a vaccine is being developed, many nations are hesitant to allow more social contact in case it spurs another wave of infection.\n\nSo could the UK expand its'social bubbles'?\n\nEngland's chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said some socially disruptive measures will have to be in place until the end of this year. But the extent of these steps, and how long they will be enforced, is difficult to predict.\n\nWhen making their decisions, scientists and policymakers look to a key metric known as the effective reproduction rate (Rt) - the rate at which the virus is spreading among the population. Britain's current Rt is one, according to the latest data from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), meaning every person who contracts it, on average, will transmit the virus to one other person.\n\nIn several countries, governments have refrained from easing lockdown measures until their national Rt is significantly less than one. For this reason, the UK has extended its lockdown for the next few weeks.\n\nStefan Flasche, an associate professor at the LSHTM, agrees it's too early to relax restrictions in the UK. But when it is safe to do so, he says the extended social bubbles may be an important\"coping mechanism\"for people while the search for a vaccine continues.\n\n\"It's not designed to solve the pandemic, but it will help the social component,\"he says.\"We will have the risk of Covid for a long time, so anything to keep society functioning would help.\"\n\n'People just need a hug'\n\nThe lockdown's impact on mental wellbeing is already being keenly felt around the world. In the US, a national mental health helpline has seen a dramatic increase in people getting in touch, with an increase in calls close to 900%. Across the Atlantic, the NHS has opened its own hotline to support health workers during the pandemic, as staff face increasing pressure.\n\nAndy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health in the UK, is unsure if a small expansion of social bubbles will be good for the public's mental health.\n\n\"It's important to understand that not everyone is experiencing this equally,\"he told the BBC. \n\n\"Lockdown is much harder if you're unsafe, if you're on a very low income, if you are in overcrowded accommodation. The challenges to mental health are far greater when you've got those risk factors anyway.\n\n\"We're going to have to learn in real-time now,\"he added.\n\nBut Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, believes such a policy would be beneficial, so long as it is managed well.\n\n\"It allows people to release that anxiety they may be feeling by being trapped indoors,\"he said.\"People have been very creative about [socialising] online but frankly, right now, people just need a hug.\"\nTL;DR: Drastically limiting people's contact with others seems to be helping many countries stem the spread of the coronavirus. But as economies slump and people become fatigued with rules, governments are weighing up how to ease lockdowns without risking a second wave of infections.\n\nArticle: By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Nigel Lockyer, head of America's premier particle physics lab, said studying the Higgs could hasten major discoveries.\n\nHe said momentum in the physics community was gathering for a machine to be built either in Europe or Asia.\n\n\"Our field uniformly agrees that would be a good thing,\"he told the BBC.\n\nThe Fermilab director added:\"The Higgs is such an interesting particle - a unique particle.\"\n\nThe Higgs boson - named after British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs - was discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle smasher under the Franco-Swiss border. \n\nThe detection capped a decades-long effort to detect the particle experimentally, adding the last missing piece to the theory of particle physics known as the Standard Model, or SM.\n\nThe SM explains how the building blocks of the Universe behave and interact, but physicists know it's just a stepping stone to a deeper understanding of the cosmos. For example, it doesn't provide an explanation for dark matter, dark energy or gravity.\n\nPhysicists had hoped that the LHC would turn up evidence of physics phenomena not explained by the Standard Model. So far, efforts to detect new physics have come away empty-handed, but studying the Higgs in more detail might break the impasse.\n\nA successor to the Large Hadron Collider would be designed in a way that allows scientists to zero in on the Higgs boson. \n\nThe LHC works by smashing beams of proton particles together, but the collisions that produce the Higgs also produce many other particles. This makes it complicated to work out which collisions produce the Higgs boson.\n\nA different type of particle smasher, called an electron-positron collider, should produce only a Higgs and another particle called a Z boson. \n\nThis makes it more suitable for detailed study of the Higgs' properties. Dr Lockyer said there were currently discussions over a new electron-positron collider in China, and a linear collider that could function as a Higgs factory in Japan. Alternatively, it could be housed at Cern after the Large Hadron Collider comes to the end of its operating lifetime.\n\nThe Higgs is interesting because it is the only fundamental\"scalar\"particle. This means it has a\"spin\"of zero. Spin is an intrinsic property of particles with applications in everyday life - such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\n\"The Higgs is the first fundamental scalar that has ever been observed. And pretty much all physics beyond the Standard Model contains scalars,\"said Dr Lockyer.\n\n\"So these scalars would mix with the Higgs - the question is how strongly. But what you're looking for is evidence of the Higgs mixing with other scalars. That would be a window into new physics.\"\n\nOne proposed scheme for new physics, which is known as supersymmetry, posits a host of new particles accompanying those we know about from the Standard Model. However, the LHC has now excluded large swathes of\"parameter space\"where supersymmetric particles could be hiding.\n\n\"When we look hard for something and don't find it, the more creative you have to get. Everybody believes there's something there, but what we're now starting to question is the scale of the new physics. At what energy does this new physics show up,\"said Dr Lockyer.\n\n\"From a simple calculation of the Higgs' mass, there has to be new science. We just can't give up on everything we know as an excuse for where we are now.\"\n\nHe said physicists were now looking for less obvious signals of new physics and using tools such as machine-learning algorithms to help them find small deviations in the vast data produced by particle physics experiments. \n\nBut he stressed that there was still plenty to come from the LHC, which will undergo a major upgrade in the 2020s.\n\nFermilab, based in Batavia, Illinois, used to house the Tevatron - the most powerful particle accelerator in the world until the LHC came online in 2009. The Tevatron was switched off in 2011, but Fermilab is currently home to an exciting array of experiments that aim to push the frontiers of physics.\n\nOne forthcoming project is Dune (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) which aims to unravel some of the mysteries of neutrinos, which are sometimes known as\"ghost particles\". Neutrinos have an intriguing property: they can switch (oscillate) between different forms, or\"flavours\". \n\nThis so-called flavour-flipping might even hold the key to why the cosmos is dominated by matter, rather than its shadowy counterpart, antimatter. \n\nThis remains one of the biggest mysteries in physics, since roughly equal amounts of each are hypothesised to have been produced in the Big Bang.\n\n\"The primary science goal is to understand whether neutrinos and anti-neutrinos oscillate differently. That has a potential big impact on our understanding of the early Universe,\"said Dr Lockyer.\n\n\"I am personally interested in observing neutrinos from a supernova that collapses into a neutron star or into a black hole. Those areas are of intense interest for many fields, as neutrinos play a role in producing heavy elements - such as gold - within a star.\"\n\nThe Dune collaboration recently elected a new co-spokesperson, Prof Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold, who leads the particle physics group at the University of Manchester, UK. \n\nHe recently told Symmetry magazine:\"This is a formative period for Dune... what we decide now will shape the detectors and the way the collaboration works for the next 10 to 20 years.\"\n\nHe added that it was important to attract young scientists to participate in Dune:\"In order to create a vibrant and strong collaboration, we need to encourage the next generation of young physicists to be engaged with the project,\"he said.\n\nThe experiment will involve beaming neutrinos from Fermilab in Illinois some 1,300km (800mi) underground to a massive detector instrument based at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota.\n\nBut before the full experiment comes online in the 2020s, test prototypes of the Dune neutrino detectors have been under construction at Cern in Europe. Each will be filled with 800 tonnes of liquid argon, kept at -184C. They are due to begin taking data in the Autumn.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\nTL;DR: A top physicist says the construction of a \"factory\" to produce Higgs boson particles is a priority for the science community.\n\nArticle: The environmental impact of music festivals has come under scrutiny in recent years and many have pledged to eradicate single-use plastic.\n\nGreenpeace is hosting an\"Eco Camp\"at Download where people must pledge to recycle their waste and take away all of their camping equipment.\n\nSign language interpreters have also been introduced for two of the stages.\n\nViewing platforms for disabled people are available across all stages, and a wheelchair charging tent is available for the first time at the festival in Leicestershire.\n\nMelvin Benn, of promoter Festival Republic, said:\"Download Festival is built upon an ethos of inclusivity and it's incredibly important to us that as many people as possible are able to enjoy the festival to the fullest.\"\n\nThe number of campsite recycling points has been increased and food traders have been banned from offering single-use plastic cutlery or food containers.

Harding had no other children.\n\nThen in 2015, genetic testing confirmed a match between Mr Blaesing's DNA and that of two Harding descendants. Mr Blaesing's biological link to Harding was officially declared by AncestryDNA, a division of Ancestry.com.\n\nDespite this, grievances have surfaced ahead of the 100-year anniversary of Harding's 1920 election as president.\n\nHarding's benefactors are preparing to mark the occasion with site upgrades and a new presidential centre in Marion, the Ohio city near which he was born in 1865. \n\nBut Mr Blaesing said he and his mother have not received the recognition they deserve in the new museum.\n\n\"I did the test and we brought it to the public in 2015. It's now 2020 and no one has asked me one thing,\"he said.\n\nMr Blaesing said he deserves to\"have his story, his mother's story and his grandmother's story included within the hallowed halls and museums in this town\".\n\nHe said he hoped to change that by providing further DNA evidence of his biological link to Harding.\n\nMr Blaesing's lawsuit to exhume Harding's remains from his presidential memorial in Marion has been challenged by another branch of the family.\n\n\"Sadly, widespread, public recognition and acceptance by the descendants, historians and biographers (and Mr Blaesing himself) that Mr Blaesing is President Harding's grandson is not enough for him,\"relatives said in a court filing.\n\nOhio History Connection, which manages the Harding home and memorial, told the Associated Press news agency that it takes no position on the family dispute.\n\nIt did, however, tell the court to consider a host of issues before disrupting the Harding Memorial's sealed sarcophagus.\n\nThe non-profit organisation said it accepted the 2015 DNA results\"as fact\"and was planning to include a section of the new museum on Britton and her daughter.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\nTL;DR: The grandson of former US President Warren G Harding has launched a legal bid to have the Republican's remains exhumed to confirm they are related.\n\nArticle: By Jane ChambersCopiapo\n\nTheir lives are now being immortalised in a Hollywood film starring Antonio Banderas and Juliette Binoche.  \n\nOne of the stars of the film is Maria Segovia, who became known as La Alcaldesa, or the Mayoress, of Camp Hope.  \n\nThis was the tent city where relatives waited for their loved ones to be brought to safety. \n\n\"I got on a bus and went straight to the mine when I heard my younger brother Dario had been trapped and I didn't leave until he came out safely,\"she recalled her time camped in the Atacama desert.\n\nBanderas' bottom\n\n\"I was very excited to meet Juliette Binoche and to teach her how to make my famous pastries,\"she told the BBC at her empanada stall at a market in the city of Antofagasta.\n\n\"But, I did tell her I thought she could do with being a bit browner and plumper, if she really wants to truthfully represent me.\"\n\nLa Alcaldesa confided that the best thing to happen to her was meeting Hollywood heartthrob Antonio Banderas, who allowed her to pinch his bottom. \n\nShe has a photo in her stall to prove it.\n\nShe says:\"To this day I haven't washed the blouse I wore when I met him.\"\n\nThe 33 miners are hoping that the film will improve their financial situation because they are getting a cut from the ticket sales. \n\nLife has been difficult for them in the last five years with health issues plaguing the vast majority and many also encountering problems with finding work.\n\nFinding love\n\n\"I suffered a mental breakdown two years after the accident which led to panic attacks, insomnia and forgetfulness.  \n\n\"I am still off work for health reasons and need to see a psychologist in Santiago every month,\"Carlos Barrios, one of the younger miners, told the BBC\n\nBut one thing he did find as a result of the accident was love.\n\nMarta Contreras is a social worker with the local council. \n\nShe helped look after the miners' families during the 69 days the men were trapped underground.  \n\nWhen they finally got out, everyone wanted to meet them. \n\nThey went on all expenses paid trips to places like Disneyland and to meet the footballers at Manchester United. \n\nMarta accompanied the miners on a trip to Israel. \n\n\"I thought I would never fall in love with one of the miners, but I began to realise that I had a shared passion with Carlos for helping other people and we started to fall in love.\"\n\nMiner Yonni Barrios and his girlfriend Susana Valenzuela are one of the most famous couples in the group. \n\nMr Barrios turned into an instant celebrity when the press discovered that his wife and girlfriend were fighting over him while he was trapped underground.  \n\nOne of the lead doctors in the rescue operation, Jean Romagnol, described how the situation came to light:\n\n\"After 17 days the miners were found alive and well and we started to send provisions down to them through a tiny borehole. \n\n\"They would send up their dirty laundry to be washed. The problem was they sent the washing to Yonni's wife Marta Salina, but she refused to do it or to hand it over to his girlfriend. \n\n\"He ended up begging me to lend him some clean clothes, until we could sort out the situation.\"\n\nDespite different versions in the press, both women knew about each other and had been friends. \n\nYonni Barrios used to shuttle back and forth between the two, but in the end he picked his girlfriend. \n\nFive years on, they are still living happily together around the corner from where Marta Salina lives.\n\nBut the experience has taken its toll on the miners. \n\nOne of the older miners, Omar Reygadas, says that it has changed his personality.  \n\n\"I used to be a very social person who loved to get together with my children and grandchildren for barbecues, but now I prefer to be alone.\"he said.\n\n\"While I was down in the mine, I felt I was just doing a very long shift.  \n\n\"But, when I came out everyone wanted a piece of me and now I hate it when the phone rings, I get angry very easily and although I love my girlfriend very much I'm relieved I don't share a house with her because I need my space.\"\n\nDespite that, five years on, he still values his family above all else and is very glad he was rescued.\n\n\"What I have learnt from all this is that you should never lose your faith that God exists and the most important thing of all is the family, you need to show them you love them.\"\n\nListen to Jane Chambers' full report on the lives of the Chilean miners five years after their rescue on the BBC World Service's Outlook programme\nTL;DR: Five years ago, one billion people tuned in to watch the successful rescue of 33 Chilean miners who had been trapped underground for 69 days.\n\nArticle: By Johny CassidyBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nJohn Vincent admits he was\"just mad\"for fast food in his youth.\n\n\"I remember, vividly, lying on my back when I was eight, waving my hands and feet in the air with delight, when my parents told me that for my birthday we were going to McDonald's,\"says the 48-year old.\n\nThat was the start of a long love affair with fast food that ultimately sparked the creation of Leon in 2004 when he was 33.\n\nHe recalls that by his early 30s he was still\"eating a heck a lot of fast food... sometimes two or three meals every day\", when he had the idea that quick service meals did not have to be unhealthy.\n\nThe result was Leon - named after his father - and launched with friends Henry Dimbleby and Allegra McEvedy.\n\n\"If we could make good food as emotionally addictive as traditional fast food, which was good for you and kind to the planet, I thought it could be a fun business to run,\"says John.\n\nFrom its first store in central London's Carnaby Street, Leon now has more than 70 restaurants across the UK and Europe, three so far in the US, and a workforce of more than 2,000.\n\nGrowing up in North London, the ethos of hard work was instilled in John early. His father's family were Italian immigrants, and his grandfather (who had changed the family name from Febraro to Vincent during World War Two) was a serial entrepreneur with multiple start-up ideas that often came to nothing.\n\n\"I had a desire in me to say,'don't worry granddad, I can do those things that you tried to do',\"says John. \"[And] I was absolutely programmed with the stories of how my grandma had to leave school at 15.\n\n\"I was told every day not to let that happen to me... and that no one's going to help you out if you don't try hard.\"\n\nThat hard work paid off. After going to school, John read history at Cambridge University - where he embarked on his first business venture, a production company doing music events.\n\n\"We'd be on the road a lot, and I just couldn't pass a McDonalds,\"he says.\"Every time I'd try to drive past, I'd end up stopping and going in to get loads of fast food for the crew in the van.\"\n\nAfter university, John spent four years working in sales and marketing at consumer goods giant Proctor & Gamble, before seven years at management consultancy firm Bain. It was while working there that he came up with the idea for Leon with his colleague Henry, son of veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby.\n\nHenry brought in Allegra, a professional chef and school friend of his sister's, and the three of them set about launching the business. John says their pitch for Leon was\"what if God did fast food?\", or\"what if fast food was in heaven?\".\n\nLooking back, John - who is married to the TV presenter Katie Derham - admits that in many ways they had it easy when looking for financial backers, because of the connections he and Henry made during their time at Bain.\n\nOne of his clients while at the consultancy was the multi-millionaire South African businessman Vivian Imerman, then the boss of whisky business Whyte & Mackay. It was Mr Imerman who put up \u00a3500,000 to help launch Leon.\n\n\"I had done a project for them, and they liked what I'd done,\"says John.\"And although they didn't really get the concept of healthy fast food, they decided to give us the money.\"\n\nFor the first few years of Leon, John combined helping to run the company with taking up the director of marketing role at Whyte and Mackay. He eventually became chief executive of Leon in 2014. Today Henry remains on the board, while Allegra is still a shareholder.\n\nJohn says that over the years his leadership style has mellowed. Out has gone his military, command-and-control approach, and in has come a more nurturing attitude.\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nHe credits taking up the Chinese martial art of Wing Tsun, which literally translates as\"beautiful springtime\", for the overhaul.\"I thought I was a good leader, but I was told I was leading like a general,\"he says.\n\nThe guiding principle of Wing Tsun, he says, is built on\"winning not fighting\", or winning by staying relaxed and flexible.  When applied to the world of business, John says that it means leadership should not be\"about confrontation\". Instead he says it is about making sure\"everyone is moving in the same direction for the right reason\". Staff at Leon are encouraged to give Wing Tsun a try.\n\nLeon's sales are certainly moving in the right direction. At a time when restaurant chains are closing down, its revenues for the 2018 financial year were up 25%. The company did not, however, make a profit, as it instead put funds into its continuing expansion. It is particularly targeting the US, where it has hired a former Burger King chief executive to lead that drive.\n\nWhile McDonald's may have been John's inspiration, Leon is not a traditional fast food joint, according to Trish Caddy, senior food service analyst at market research company Mintel. She says it instead occupies a\"blurred middle ground between traditional fast food in the UK, and what we consider casual dining\".\n\nIn the US it would be known as\"casual fast dining\"- higher quality food, without table service.\n\nMs Caddy adds that Leon's\"uniqueness is being at the cutting-edge of menu innovation that is geared towards the business crowd\".\n\n\"Leon stands out by focusing on making healthy food and drink more accessible to city-dwellers and commuters throughout the day,\"she says.\n\nThat concurs with John's vision for Leon in the first place.\"It's got to be with fresh ingredients, with good gut health, with Mediterranean food principles,\"he says.\"And in a place where people smile because they want to smile.\"\nTL;DR: The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

At the time, Mr Danczuk was the MP for Rochdale.\n\nThe Sun columnist wrote:\"Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion. it is inflammatory. @SimonDanczuk you & your party disgust me.\"\n\nShe later sent a picture of eight men convicted of child sex exploitation offences in Greater Manchester, asking Mr Danczuk if they were his friends too.\n\nMr Danczuk, 48, said Rochdale has faced up to the\"heinous crime\"of child grooming\"in a way that's managed to keep our communities together\".\n\n\"To equate the Pakistan flag with child abuse, as she has done on social media over the last week, is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable,\"he said.\n\n\"I'm not prepared to allow people like Hopkins, who know nothing about our town, stir up tensions in such a dangerously provocative way that could lead to innocent people being attacked by extremists.\"\n\nHe claimed he has been threatened by extremists and groups have pledged to march in Rochdale as a result of Hopkins' tweets. \n\nMs Hopkins, who has appeared on a number of reality TV shows, has yet to comment.\n\nHowever, she posted on her Twitter account:\"Thanks for the kind messages of support.

Wadely was jailed for 17 years in 2016.\n\nThe group, which operated in Oxford and Reading, sourced cocaine from an Albanian organised crime gang and conspired to supply up to 7kg (15lbs) of that drug and 50kg (110lbs) of cannabis, the court heard.\n\nThames Valley Police said gang members had supplied drugs from as far away as Spain.\n\n'Widespread and complex' \n\nRumble went to Thailand just days before police arrested other members of the gang in 2015. \n\nPolice said that during Operation Samba, 18 defendants were brought to court\"with a total of 115 years and three months' jail time being handed down\".\n\nDet Con Rebecca Cartwright said Rumble's sentencing had brought a close to the operation which was a\"widespread and complex investigation\"into gangs making a\"substantial profit through drug dealing and distribution\".\n\nRumble was sentenced on 12 March and previously admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine, cannabis and amphetamines, and possession of methoxetamine with intent to supply.\nTL;DR: A major police operation into drug dealing across the south of England has ended after a prisoner extradited from Thailand was sentenced.\n\nArticle: Latest figures show in December they succeeded in responding to only 56.1% of the most urgent (Category A) calls within eight minutes compared to a target of 65%.\n\nThe figures show a 2.3% drop in performance compared to November.\n\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said it had recently faced\"significant pressure\".\n\nA spokesman said:\"During the month of December 2012 we dealt with 38,135 emergency incidents across Wales, an increase of almost 12% on November's figure, 34,168. \n\n\"In recent months, the healthcare system across Wales has faced significant pressure with increased cases of winter-related illnesses, such as flu and sickness viruses, and the ambulance service in general continues to experience a higher volume of calls.\n\n\"We would like to reassure the public that the trust is firmly committed to delivering the improvement aims of its Working Together for Success modernisation programme and will continue to work with health boards and other partners to improve our services for the people of Wales.\"\n\n\"We also require the support of the public and would encourage them to only dial 999 and attend Emergency Departments for life threatening and serious illnesses and injuries - remember to keep emergency ambulances for your emergencies\n\nWelsh government health minister Lesley Griffiths announced a review into the service last November.\n\nOf the 38,135 emergency calls in December, almost 15,600 were Category A calls.\n\nDecember's figures show the ambulance service responded to 12% more emergency calls than the previous month.\n\nBefore the latest figures were announced, Roy Norris, former chair of the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust, said people would be wrong to think that the simple answer was to have more ambulances.\n\nHe said the Welsh government review of the service would probably look at why ambulances are sometimes forced to wait long periods outside busy hospitals with patients waiting to be admitted.\n\n\"There has got to be an entire system review of why it is ambulances are held, why hospitals can't clear people through the emergency department and it will probably be looking at why people can't be discharged from hospital when they are ready to be discharged,\"he told BBC Radio Wales.\n\n'Immense pressure'\n\nWelsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said:\"The figures released today have shown that ambulance response rates in December were the lowest of any month in 2012. \n\n\"While paramedics and technical staff are striving for excellence, they are facing immense pressure and having to work with increasingly stretched resources.\"\n\nThe ambulance service performed worst in Rhondda Cynon Taf responding to just 43.5% of the most urgent calls within eight minutes, figures reveal.

Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy.

Even the fact that Ofcom are investigating the first broadcast has not made them divert from this path.\n\n\"This issue is not about me, other than Harvey is my son.

Among them are milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil.\n\nMoreover, the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimates that there is a shortage of 70% of medication in most pharmacies across the country.\n\nFood companies complain that with regulated prices, some items are just not profitable to produce. \n\nThe government accuses producers of deliberately stockpiling products in order to drive prices up.\n\nVenezuelan-based broadcaster Telesur recently alleged that the shortages were a\"concerted effort by the opposition to create psychological distress in the country ahead of elections\".\n\nInflation\n\nWith shortages and queues, prices for essential goods are skyrocketing in the black market, driving up the cost of living.\n\nThe IMF predicts annual inflation of 159% in Venezuela this year - the highest in any country in the world. In 2016 it could be upwards of 200%, according to the Fund.\n\nVenezuela has not released any official inflation data this year, but President Maduro recently stated that figure for 2015 was likely to be 85%.\n\nThe government tries to tackle rising inflation with price controls; recently it fixed the price for a carton of 30 eggs at 420 bolivares.\n\nBut not all sellers stick to the fixed prices. Consumers reported paying almost three times as much on the black market, according to Huevo Today (Egg Today), a Twitter account on which Venezuelans share information on the prices of eggs.\n\nExchange rate\n\nVenezuela has three official exchange rates and an illegal black market rate.\n\nThe first two are used for importing goods which the government considers essential, such as food, medicine or household items. The third one is for Venezuelans who do not have the authorisation to buy dollars at the preferential rates.\n\nBut the black market rate is the one which many Venezuelans use as it is hard to get approval to exchange money at the official rates.\n\nThe disparity between the first rate and that of the black market is enormous. One dollar will buy you 6.3 bolivares at the lowest official rate, while on the black market it will fetch a whopping 800 bolivares, according to the widely used website DolarToday.com website. \n\nThe government introduced currency controls in 2003 to stem the flow of capital out of the country, but instead they have been a driving factor in pushing up inflation.\n\nImporting goods can be prohibitively expensive and companies are forced to find local alternatives.\n\nFor 10 months, fast food chain McDonald's replaced its French fries with yuka fries - made with local cassava - because importing potatoes had become too dear.\n\nFrench fries only returned to its menu last month when McDonald's finally managed to source potatoes locally.\n\nLiving standard\n\nOne of the proudest achievements of Chavismo - as the politics of the late President Hugo Chavez and his successor in office Mr Maduro are known - is its record in reducing poverty and inequality.\n\nPoverty levels were halved between 2003 to 2011 and Venezuela's Gini co-efficient, which measures inequality, improved greatly.\n\nSocial programmes sponsored by the government helped boost real income, but many fear that in a recession some of those gains are at risk of being reversed.\n\nA recent study by three Venezuelans universities suggested that poverty had already increased massively. The study suggested 73% of the population now lived in poverty - up from 27% in 2013.\n\nThe government dismissed the study, saying that not only had poverty not risen but that extreme poverty had fallen in 2015. \n\nOfficials also said that unemployment had fallen to a historic low of 6.7%.\nTL;DR: Venezuelans went to the polls on Sunday to elect all 167 members of the National Assembly amid tension caused by the country's worsening economic decline.\n\nArticle: Naasir Francis, 22, was shot in the stomach on Lozells Road, in Lozells, at about 12:30 BST on Wednesday.\n\nA 22-year-old man has been arrested in Hertfordshire on suspicion of murder and a 21-year-old woman is suspected of assisting an offender. \n\nOn Friday police were still questioning a 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday.\n\nA man aged 39 suspected of assisting an offender also remained in custody.\n\nA 23-year-old woman held on suspicion of assisting an offender has been released pending further investigation.\n\nMr Francis died shortly after arriving at hospital.\n\nIn a statement, his family said:\"A deep comfort has been lost by his mother and siblings.\n\n\"A much loved and respected young man in his community, Naasir's charming personality, birthed a light of spiritedness in the eyes of his family, a light that has dulled since his passing.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

But General Carter says there are risks here as well as benefits.\n\n\"That public support,\"he says,\"is very much based upon sympathy and not necessarily upon empathy. \n\n\"And I think if we wish to sustain our numbers, and indeed the sort of attitude you would want your army to have, I think it's important that the cursor swings more towards empathy than sympathy, so that people understand more about what an army does and why you need an army, and therefore what its final task might be.\"\n\nOf course the Army is about much more than that final task -\"closing with and engaging the enemy\".\n\nBut the unpopularity of some of Britain's recent wars, the lack of understanding about military matters among much of the public, and the increasing sensitivity to casualties, have all meant that the term\"boots on the ground\"- putting soldiers into harm's way - has become almost toxic.\n\nGeneral Carter has some sympathy with this view.\n\n\"I think the term'boots on the ground' has become difficult for people to comprehend.\n\nUnprecedented change\n\n\"The trick of course is for boots on the ground to be applied in a way that is not necessarily risk-free, but is done for appropriate gain and benefit.\"\n\nThis issue of the relationship between Britain and her army is a central aspect of General Carter's thinking.\n\nHe is speaking at an Estonian army base in Tapa, a garrison town a little under 100 miles from the Russian border. \n\nThe general is visiting the British-led multi-national battle group, which is there as part of a Nato deployment to reassure the Estonians and to demonstrate the alliance's cohesion to Moscow.\n\n\"Young people join an army to be used and that is important to us,\"he says.\n\n\"So the opportunity to do something like we are doing up here in Estonia is important.\n\n\"But we also need to be prepared to be used in other ways as well, providing we can be used in an effective fashion.\"\n\nFor the British army, this is a period of unprecedented change as it transitions away from a dominant focus on counter-insurgency operations in the heat of Iraq and Afghanistan, and re-builds its capability to fight modern high-intensity combat - the sort of conflict it trained for day-in and day-out during the Cold War years.\n\nLessons of history\n\nThe strategic picture is also changing dramatically.\n\nThe potential threats are becoming more complex, the dividing line between peace and war ever less clear.\n\nSome people argue that the modern, Western way of war is at arm's-length - exemplified by armed drones and stand-off weapons fired at great distances from their intended targets.\n\nBy such readings the traditional army - leaving aside maybe the special forces - seems strangely out of step with the apparent new reality. \n\nBut General Carter disagrees.\n\n\"I don't subscribe to the view that we find ourselves in a new era of warfare where you can do it all with stand-off; you can do it all with bombing; you can do it all with special forces and you can do it all with proxies,\"he tells me emphatically. \n\n\"Those are all simply fallacies. The bottom line in all of this is that, in the final analysis, people live on land and it is ultimately the land component that has to'mix it' where people live. History proves that that is a requirement.\n\n\"Our policy makers absolutely understand that you have an army because, in the final analysis, armies are the business when it comes to a decision, and ultimately it's about a decision.\"\n\n'Adequate numbers'\n\nBritain's army is of course an awful lot smaller than it once was.\n\nHow big should it be in part depends upon what the country can afford. So does General Carter think that he has enough soldiers?\n\n\"The straightforward answer to that question is that given the tasks that we have currently got, we have adequate numbers,\"he says.\n\n\"If the tasks change or the tasks increase then we might have to ask questions about it.\"\n\nOn equipment he is confident that the Army will get things that it needs, though\"how quickly it arrives is always a question\".\n\nBut the Army itself is going to change even more dramatically in the years ahead. And this too is something that General Carter is pushing forward.\n\nTraditionally the Army - like most others - is what he terms\"bottom-fed\". \n\nIn other words,\"it recruits people who are youngsters and we grow them through a career\".\n\nBut he believes that as the Army requires and takes on more specialists, it is going to have to offer a very different career structure. \n\n\"I suspect,\"he says,\"that maybe as much as 30% of the army may be specialists in the future - and how we supply those specialist career schemes is something we have to think about.\"\n\nThis could mean a lot more of what the Army calls\"lateral entry\"(ie joining at a much later age, probably from an established career) or indeed sharing people with industry.\n\nNonetheless, at least in his lifetime, General Carter does not expect the combat arms of the Army\"to look particularly different\"to the way they do today.\n\n\"I think we will still deliver that effect through a bottom-fed delivery system in the way that we understand it.\"\n\nBut he says specialists will need to be recruited differently and that will have significant implications requiring a review of ranks, career structures, working practices and so on.\n\n'Miscalculation risk'\n\nGeneral Carter thinks that the Army is about a year or two away from taking on regular personnel by this lateral entry method.\n\nBut the core business of the Army is not going to change.\n\nWhile its roles go way beyond just training for high-intensity combat, as here in Estonia, it remains part of the nation's insurance policy.\n\nSo being so close to the Russian border, what security challenge does the general worry about most?\n\n\"Probably the greatest risk at the moment,\"he says,\"is the risk of miscalculation.\n\n\"Understanding your potential opponents,\"he says,\"and having the communications systems in place and the processes in place so that you realise what messages you are sending is fundamental.\n\n\"Miscalculation is the thing that we probably need to watch.\"\nTL;DR: As he visits troops bolstering Nato's eastern border in Estonia in response to rising tensions with Russia, General Sir Nick Carter - the British army's top soldier - explains how the armed forces need to win support for their changing mission.\n\nArticle: By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter \n\nThe burgers he has been tucking into have been described by Bill Gates as\"the future of food\"- lab-grown meat culled from the cells of animals.\n\nMr Friedrich was at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference to talk about how lab-grown meat could feed an ever-increasing population and solve environmental issues.\n\nThe firm Beyond Meat was also in Vancouver to give delegates a taste of its plant-based meat substitute.\n\nBeyond Meat, along with Silicon Valley firm Impossible Foods, are already offering plant-based meat alternatives but there are dozens of firms experimenting with developing meat products which takes the cells of living animals and'grows' meat from them.\n\nMr Friedrich thinks the general public will get their first taste of cell-based meat in 2020 but, initially at least, will have to pay a premium of around $50 (\u00a338).\n\nThe founder of the Good Food Institute, an organisation supporting the creation of plant and cell-based meat, has become one of this year's TED fellows.\n\nHis think tank has ploughed $2.8m (\u00a32.1m) into 14 projects which are developing ways to grow meat and scale it up to mass production - and hoping to get the price tag down in the process.\n\nCultured meat, or clean meat as it is sometimes called because of its low environmental impact, has the ability to transform farming, Mr Friedrich told the BBC.\n\n\"We grow a massive amount of crops just to feed farm animals. For every nine calories we put into a chicken we get one calorie out. It is a fantastically inefficient way to create food,\"he said.\n\n\"And it is estimated that we need to provide between 70% and 100% more meat by 2050.\"\n\nThe demands of an ever-growing population, coupled with the environmental impact of intensive farming, means farmers have to look at alternative ways of producing meat, he said.\n\n\"We are not going to change human nature so we just have to change the meat,\"said Mr Friedrich.\n\n'Not another veggie burger'\n\nAnd this new age of synthetic meat has little to do with vegetarianism.\n\n\"We hear vegetarians say that they don't want to eat these products and we say, partly joking, that we really don't care what vegetarians think of it,\"he said.\n\n\"This is not yet another veggie burger.\"\n\nA clean meat\"farm\"will look very different - more like a brewery than a farm - and would not require any animals, said Mr Friedrich.\n\n\"The cells of the animals would be immortalised in cell banks,\"he explained. \n\n\"It would require 99% less land which means that farmers can move away from the'get big or get out' theory of farming.\n\n\"There would still be farm sanctuaries where animals could live out their lives.\"\n\nTraditional crops like millet might see a comeback and farmers would be able to work\"more in tune with the soil\".\n\nThis may seem like an idealised view of the future to some but already meat alternatives are going mass market.\n\nA vegan sausage roll launched at UK bakery Greggs in January caused a flurry of headlines and a spike in the company's profits. \n\nMeanwhile, Burger King is trialling its Impossible Whopper in 59 restaurants in the US with plans to roll them out across the country.\n\nBurger King's new veggie burger is made by Impossible Foods, which develops plant-based products that replicate both the taste and texture of real meat. \n\nIts'secret' ingredient is heme, an iron-containing molecule that is credited by some with giving meat its'meaty' taste.  \n\nMy first taste of Meet\n\nBefore heading to the TED conference in Vancouver, I took a detour to a restaurant called Meet in the city's famous Gastown district. It is one of a chain of places serving Beyond Meat burgers. \n\nAs a pescatarian who had not eaten meat for 20 years, this was a new challenge.

but the way it is diagnosed varies widely.\n\nThe researchers say this list of six groups of symptoms could help form a new definition of constipation:\n\nWhat is this list based on?\n\nThe researchers surveyed 2,557 members of the public, 411 GPs and 365 gastroenterology specialists and published the results in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.\n\nThey found that what most people think of as symptoms of constipation aren't included in any official diagnostic criteria.\n\nThese include:\n\nWhile most people who said they had constipation had symptoms that matched the official criteria, one in three'healthy' patients didn't recognise their symptoms of constipation at all.\n\nAnd doctors and the public don't seem to agree on the signs to look out for either, the study found.\n\nMedics placed lots of emphasis on infrequent bowel movements, as a symptom, but only half of people who said they had constipation actually experienced this symptom.\n\nWhat do the researchers say?\n\nDr Eirini Dimidi, study author from King's College London, said:\"Our research may indicate that people who seek help for symptoms of constipation don't always have them recognised, diagnosed or managed.\"\n\nShe said constipation was usually caused by a lack of fibre or fluid in the diet but it could also be a sign of another underlying problem, such as bowel cancer, diverticular disease or coeliac disease.\n\nDr Dimidi said it was\"always important to consult your doctor if you experience gut symptoms\".\n\nWhat about other experts?\n\nListening to what patients say about constipation is important, said Julie Harrington, from charity Guts UK.\n\n\"Patients are the experts, by experience, and when they come together with specialists, that's the sweet spot.\"\n\nNot all constipation is the same, and different people have different symptoms, she added.\n\n\"Bowel problems are less likely to be picked up than other problems because people wait 6-12 months out of fear and embarrassment. \n\n\"You have to tune into your body.\"\n\nHow often should we poo?\n\nThis is difficult to answer - it can vary dramatically from person to person.\n\nIn the study, seven bowel movements a week was the average among people who weren't constipated.\n\nBut experts say three bowel movements a day to three a week qualifies as normal.\n\nSo you need to know what's normal for you - and then look out for changes. \n\nWhat are the treatment options?\n\nMost people recognise the problem themselves and try to solve it by increasing the fibre in their diet and drinking more fluid, according to NHS advice. \n\nFibre is present in wholegrain bread, wholegrain pasta, fruit, nuts, pulses and cereals.\n\nTaking more exercise and eating regular meals can also help. \n\nYou can buy laxatives from the chemist if diet and lifestyle changes aren't working.\n\nBut it's important to see your GP if the problem persists, and you have other symptoms.\nTL;DR: Doctors and the public are at odds over the symptoms of constipation, leaving some people without the advice or treatment they need, researchers say.\n\nArticle: Here we answer your questions on the astonishing find at Prittlewell near Southend.\n\nHow was it discovered?\n\nThe Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) was commissioned by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council to perform an archaeological investigation on the site ahead of a proposed road widening scheme.\n\nThe small verge between the road and rail line was known to be in the area of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery,\n\nHowever, said MOLA's Anglo-Saxon specialist Sue Hirst,\"archaeologists had not expected to discover an intact princely burial\".\n\nThe grave contained dozens of rare artefacts and tooth enamel fragments which experts have suggested could belong to Seaxa, a 6th Century Anglo-Saxon prince.\n\nHe was brother to Saebert, the Saxon king of Essex from AD604 to AD616.\n\nHow much were the treasures found worth in today's money?\n\nSome 40 rare and precious artefacts were found inside the burial site. They included an ornate sword with collars of ribbed gold, drinking vessels made with the precious metal, decorative glass beakers and a lyre.\n\nExperts say the finds in Southend are unique, so it is difficult to put a monetary price on them. However,\"in archaeological terms, they are invaluable\", said Ms Hirst. \n\nWhy don't these tombs get waterlogged?\n\n\"This chamber was made of timber that decayed over time with soil from the mound above gradually seeping into the chamber,\"explained Ms Hirst.\n\n\"The ground at the site is relatively free-draining sandy soil so there was very little waterlogging.\"\n\nWhy is there no or little trace of the occupant?\n\nThe environmental conditions in the chamber meant the skeleton and most of the organic remains - including the timber structure - had decayed.\n\nBut fragments of tooth enamel were later found in environmental samples that proved there had been a person buried inside, said Ms Hirst. \n\n\"The position of the gold crosses, gold belt buckle and copper-alloy garter buckles fastened over the instep of the foot within the coffin allows us to infer that he was about 5ft 8in tall,\"she said.\n\nIs the DNA of the body available?\n\nSince only tiny fragmentary remains of tooth enamel were found in the burial chamber, experts say there is not enough material for DNA analysis.\n\nWhat was the motive for burying him at that precise location?\n\nThe site was within an existing Anglo-Saxon cemetery and there is archaeological evidence for several settlements nearby.\n\n\"The person buried is likely to have been of princely lineage from the ruling families of the Kingdom of the East Saxons,\"said Ms Hirst.\n\n\"The burial implies the presence of such a ruling family in the area with an estate including a great hall where followers and visitors could receive hospitality.\"\n\nWould Seaxa's brother, Saebert, be buried nearby then?\n\nIt is possible, but the discovery at Prittlewell offers no conclusive evidence.\n\nMs Hirst said:\"Saebert could have also been buried in the Prittlewell area, or he might have been buried in London where he was baptised - or indeed elsewhere.\"\n\nDid archaeologists find any Roman artefacts belonging to Seaxa?\n\nNone of the artefacts found in the burial chamber were Roman, but several are related to Roman and Byzantine objects.\n\nThese include the folding iron stool and the iron stand thought to have been used as a candelabrum - both items that evoke authority and high status, said Ms Hirst. \n\nThere are also items imported from the Christian eastern Mediterranean, such as a silver spoon, copper-alloy flagon and bowl.\n\nWho should you contact if you find something of archaeological significance?\n\nArchaeologists are involved from an early stage in development projects, as set out in planning guidelines, so they are normally the ones who find sites of significance.\n\nBut if members of the public do find artefacts they think are significant, they should try not to disturb them and contact their local finds liaison officer at the Portable Antiquities Scheme.\n\nMore information is available on the scheme's website.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\nTL;DR: Treasures discovered in an Anglo-Saxon royal burial site have gone on display for the first time.

Police are also reportedly hunting several students.  \n\nEspousing separatism is illegal in Sri Lanka.  Suspects can be held without charge for 18 months.\n\nThe detentions come at a time of rising political tensions in the north.\n\nLast week security forces and students clashed at Jaffna University in the worst political disturbances since the civil war ended in 2009. Students had tried to mark\"Martyrs' Day\", which commemorates dead Tamil Tiger fighters.\n\n'Kept in the dark'\n\nOfficials gave differing accounts of the number of arrests made by anti-terrorist police in the latest raids.  \n\nPolice spokesman Prishantha Jayakody said that 10 men had been detained on Wednesday in the Jaffna area, all of them accused of\"terrorist activities\"with the Tamil Tigers or LTTE before 2009. \n\nMr Jayakody said that none those being held had completed a government rehabilitation course for LTTE suspects and none had surrendered to the police or army at the end of the war.  \n\n\"They were arrested at different places on the Jaffna peninsula and are now in Vavuniya,\"he said. \"All the families have been informed.\" \n\nHe said that police were guided to the suspects by intelligence reports.    \n\nBut the head of the police's Terrorist Investigation Division, Chandra Wakista, told the BBC that as many as 20 to 25 had been detained.\n\n\"No arrests have been made without procedure, all of them were made officially,\"he said. \n\nThe police say families have been given official documents relating to the arrests. \n\nBut the BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says that some relatives have apparently been kept in the dark - one family told a newspaper they only got official information on their son's arrest a long time after he disappeared, and only after they informed the official human rights body.\n\nRights workers are also mindful of the fact that a year ago two young campaigners disappeared in Jaffna, where tensions have continued since the

There were things that it didn't do well.\"\n\nBack then, programmers also thought it absurd the Mac designers had abandoned the typical alpha-numeric interface in favour of a friendlier graphical one and a point-and-click mouse, making it too easy for users, recalls Leander Kahney, editor of The Cult of Mac news website. \n\n\"They thought it trivialised their profession,\"he adds.\n\nThe original model's 128 kilobytes of RAM (random access memory) also limited its use.\n\nBut three decades later, Macs are still here and selling briskly.\n\nOver the weekend, more than 100 members of the original Mac team were reunited at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, where Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs had first introduced the computer on 24 January 1984, to commemorate its 30th anniversary. \n\nBelow, in their own words, are excerpts from the pioneering software and hardware developers' recollections of creating the all-in-one computer.\n\nHardware design\n\nThe developers were asked if they had felt defensive about other PC-makers laughing at them for selling a\"closed box\".\n\nJerry Manock (industrial design lead): \n\nSteve had an incredibly good answer to that. [When] the Apple II came out, third-party vendors could put boards in, you could use other monitors, etc.  \n\nWhenever there was a failure, or the customer had a problem, Apple Computer got the call.\n\nIt could have been [the fault of] any number of third party vendors. It could have been the monitor, the disk drive, whatever. \n\nSo, Steve made the decision: if we supply the display and the boards [and] everything is sealed up inside the box and it works when it leaves the factory, then we're willing to take the responsibility of answering the service calls. \n\nBill Atkinson (developer of MacPaint & MacDraw):\n\nWe were trying to make something that was user-friendly and that meant someone could walk up to it and figure out how to use it without using a manual.\n\nJerry Manock: \n\nJef Raskin's [original Mac project leader] idea was portability. \n\nWhen Steve took the Mac project over, he had a vision that this computer was going to be sitting on a worker's desk.\n\nHe wanted it to [take] minimal space on the desk, so that was a pretty radical change.\n\nGeorge Crow (analogue circuit board engineer):\n\nWe knew if [Steve] just ground you down a few days you'd come up with an even better idea a few days later.\n\nBill Atkinson: \n\nSteve wasn't really an engineer but he knew how to get the best out of people.\n\nOne time Larry Kenyon was working on the operating system, and Steve said:'We need to make this thing faster, it's taking too long to start up. Now Larry, if it would save someone's life, could you make it 10 seconds faster?'\n\nLarry said:\"Yeah, probably I could.\"\n\nTwo days later, it was 30 seconds faster.\n\nThe team were asked what it was like having Microsoft write some of the application software, knowing that co-founder Bill Gates later remarked he had more people working on the original Mac's software than Apple did.\n\nRandy Wittington (MacWrite developer):\n\nIf they had more people than us it doesn't speak very highly of the quality of the piece that they had. \n\nAndy Hertzfeld (Mac operating system developer): \n\nMicrosoft wasn't what they became at that time. They were a small private company. Apple probably had 20 times the revenues of Microsoft when they started, but they were our close collaborators. \n\nThey were the first company we gave a Mac to. They really helped us.\n\nWe didn't have enough applications. We really only had MacPaint and MacWrite, [and] they were working on three applications.\n\nThe Mac's early development team envisioned selling the personal computer for $1,000 (\u00a3605), but later, after the cost of essential parts like Motorola's 68000 microprocessor were factored in, the price bumped upwards. \n\nAndy Hertzfeld: \n\n$1,495 that was our price for years and years and years.\n\nThen... John Sculley [Apple's chief executive at the time] convinced us we have to charge $2,495 to pay for a big marketing campaign. That kind of broke my heart because that really is the difference of a kid being able to get their hands on one or not.\n\nCaroline Rose (Documentation developer):\n\nI remember the meeting where that price was announced. It was such sad day... We were all just really depressed.\n\nAndy Hertzfeld:\n\nBecause we all thought we were making something for ourselves and the people we cared about. And that price, once it got up above $2,000, it could no longer be that.\n\nBill Atkinson:\n\nIt wasn't work. We were making art. Steve insisted that we sign our names on a piece of paper with a Sharpie [pen] and he engraved it on to the mould [inside of the case of the first production run] so all of our signatures would be on it. And the reason is: real artists sign their work and they're proud of it.  \n\nRod Holt (co-developer Mac Finder):\n\nThis process of invention is very unusual... we were more than willing workers. \n\nThe peculiar thing was that [Jobs] didn't understand somebody would work day and night on a computer or any other project and not do it out of love.\n\nBut, see, we weren't doing it for money. I don't think anybody would have quit if Steve had come and said:\"You guys don't get paid.\"\n\nI think we would have still had a group and we still would have been working.\nTL;DR: It's hard to imagine nowadays, but when Apple introduced the Macintosh personal computer in 1984 it was widely dismissed as a \"toy\".\n\nArticle: Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) reported there were 4,862 awards of bankruptcy compared to 4,644 during 2017-18.\n\nPTDs rose year-on-year from 5,958 to 7,917.

That has been a very beautiful contribution - it has been reassuring.\"\n\nPeace pacts\n\nNonetheless he says that the residents of Sabon Gari can feel like second-class citizens as the area pays more tax than the rest of the city, because of its many businesses, but sees little benefit.\n\nSabon Gari may boast a multitude of churches with elaborate names like the Later Glory Assemblies - The Relevant Church of the Hour and The Covenant Cathedral of the Locust Army International Dwelling in Gethsemane, but many of its buildings are dilapidated.\n\nThe shop fronts and flats flank roads, some with little tarmac left that are full of pot holes and gullies.\n\n\"Our area is never taken care of and we pay so much tax\u2026 the infrastructure is atrocious,\"says Dr Ayelangbe, who in the nearly 40 years he has practised at his clinic, has seen the area change from a majority Yoruba to a majority Igbo area.\n\nNigeria decides: Presidential candidates\n\n\"In politics you tend to satisfy those who vote for you\u2026  and Sabon Gari being a non-Hausa Fulani environ, they are not too sure where their loyalty is\u2026 so invariably Sabon Gari gets nothing,\"he says.\n\nPeople who are not from Kano are also not entitled to free education in the state, which also rankles - and Igbo parents with children born in Kano say they struggle to get their offspring\"indigene certificates\", which would allow them scholarships.\n\nEmmanuel Nwude, who runs a non-governmental organisation promoting Nigerian unity, wants to do away with the term\"stranger\"and\"non-indigene\"altogether as he sees this as part of a mindset that fuels divisive relations.\n\nHe is hopeful that peace pacts signed this year between rival parties will stop a repeat of any post-poll violence.\n\nThe tension in Kano has been eased by the six-week delay to the poll, but Mr Adiba says during election season\"people throw away their cordiality\".\n\nThe Sabon Gari resident says he escaped attack in February from opposition supporters because he took the precaution of carrying a small broom - the symbol of Muhammadu Buhari's All Progressives Congress.\n\n\"There is nobody from the east who is going to stay in the north during the elections.

For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (\u00a3215). \n\nAnd at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (\u00a3690).\n\nUnsustainable bubble\n\nBitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where. \n\nVerifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins. \n\nRising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies. \n\nRivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months. \n\nThe surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing. \n\n\"The question is not if but when the market will turn,\"said an editorial in The Economist.\nTL;DR: The value of Bitcoin has hit a new high with each individual coin now worth more than $2,100 (\u00a31,615).\n\nArticle: By Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland's environment correspondent\n\nHES said it aimed to be\"net-zero\"by 2045 in line with the Scottish government's target.\n\nThe organisation plans to reduce the amount of visitor vehicles by 2028 by creating parking hubs where it has clusters of properties.\n\nLow carbon\"district heating\"systems could also be used on some sites.\n\nDistrict heating takes energy released as heat and transfers it elsewhere using highly insulated pipes.

of animals and objects\"and\"combining unrelated concepts in plausible ways\".\n\nBut it admitted the success of the model depended on how the descriptions were phrased. \n\n\"As more objects are

But viewers in the south would still see fewer Scottish programmes than people who live in the STV region. \n\nBut the second option could see viewers in Cumbria receive programmes of little interest to them unless technical arrangements were made to make sure the extra Scottish programmes were only seen in the Scottish part of the region.\n\nThe document also mentioned the notion of auctioning a new Channel 3 licence covering the whole of Scotland to replace Border and STV's existing licences. However this option is not being pursued.  \n\nThe consultation document also looks at possible changes to the rest of the Channel 3 network.\n\nNo major changes are being proposed for the STV service in central and northern Scotland. But ITV plans to increase the number of distinct regional news programmes shown at 18:00 in return for a cut in the length of the bulletins at lunchtime, 22:30 and at the weekend.\n\nRegional output\n\nITV's preference is for a 30 minute regional current affairs programme covering Cumbria and the south of Scotland. \n\nIt would be shown on a weekday evening at 22:35 but might be repeated on Sundays.\n\nThe company also questioned whether most viewers in the Border region would really want to see more of STV's regional output.\n\nAn ITV spokesman said:\"Our proposals for Border are based first and foremost on the needs of viewers.  It is clear from both our and Ofcom's research that viewers in Border want news about their local area rather than news dominated by the urban agendas of either central belt Scotland or the north east of England.\n\n\"We are therefore proposing to return to a dedicated Border news service for Cumbria and southern Scotland.  We are also planning a new half-hour, weekly current affairs and politics programme for Border that will focus on the stories, issues and concerns of viewers across the whole region. It will have a particular emphasis on matters dealt with by the Scottish Parliament.\n\n\"If these proposals are approved by Ofcom we hope to have the new services in place by the autumn of this year, allowing us to fully cover the run up to the referendum on independence for Scotland.\"  \n\nThe consultation closes on 2 May. Any changes are likely to come into force by the start of 2015 at the latest.\nTL;DR: Big changes could be made to the regional ITV service in the south of Scotland, under proposals from the communications regulator Ofcom.\n\nArticle: The Chinese firm, one of the biggest smartphone vendors behind Apple and Samsung, said that its shipments also rose 44% to 108 million units.\n\nThe company's growth figures come as it launched its latest flagship smartphone - the Huawei Mate 8 - in Las Vegas. \n\nIts telecom devices for carriers, such as routers, are banned in the US.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company is also one of the world's largest telecommunications firms, but has been blocked from participating in broadband projects in the US and Australia over espionage fears.\n\nBut other businesses, such as consumer electronic products including mobile devices, are allowed into the US market.\n\nHigh-margin challenge\n\nHuawei's smartphone business has been growing rapidly.

A woman whose financial problems began when trying to escape domestic violence. \n\nA couple whose work did not pay enough. A woman who faced a penalty charge from the NHS and was self-harming.\n\n\"Poverty is very hidden, but it is very real,\"says Mrs Aikens. \n\n'Dignity'\n\nThe Trussell Trust figures show that people on benefits are the most typical recipients, but a significant proportion of three-day food supplies, about 320,000, go to people in work.\n\nMrs Aikens says it is important to welcome people and give them\"dignity\"when they come to the food bank.\n\nThe food has been donated, often through supermarkets, and those collecting it have been referred by other services, such as Citizens Advice, GPs, schools and children's services.\n\nIf there is a risk of such handouts being exploited by scroungers, queuing for a bag of pasta and tinned peaches seems like a fairly low-gain fraud.\n\nThose arriving often bring other problems, including depression and anxiety - and food banks are turning into mini-welfare and advice centres.\n\nSt Matthew's is offering access to psychotherapy sessions, along with consumer and legal advice, holiday clubs for families and training sessions on cooking and budgeting.\n\nBenefits delays?\n\n\"What we are seeing year upon year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. This is not right,\"says the Trussell Trust's chief executive Emma Revie.\n\nThere are now about 2,000 food banks across the UK, with the Trussell Trust accounting for about 1,200 of them. The number of supplies being distributed has risen by 73% over the past five years.\n\nThe trust puts particular blame on the benefits system - in particular delays in payments during the transition to universal credit.\n\nThis is rejected by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which says there is no delay for claimants.\n\n\"It also cannot be claimed that universal credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth,\"said a DWP spokeswoman.\n\nWhatever the reason, the idea of food banks would once have seemed out of place in the UK, but John Griffiths, a volunteer and trustee at St Matthew's, says without them\"people would be on the streets begging\".\n\nWho really uses food banks?\n\nResearchers from University of Oxford and King's College London tried to identify the typical users of food banks, in a major study a couple of years ago.\n\nThey found the most frequent recipients were single men, lone mothers with children and single women - between them accounting for about two-thirds of all food bank users.\n\nIt was usually people of working age, middle-aged rather than young or old, mostly living in rented accommodation.\n\nAlmost nine in 10 were born in the UK.\n\nThese food bank users were living in\"extreme financial vulnerability\"and might have a life of missing meals, often for days at a time, going without heating and electricity.\n\nAbout five out of six were without a job and depending on benefits - and those in employment were usually in insecure, low-paying work.\nTL;DR: Baked beans, tinned fish and canned fruit are carried out of a church in west London by neatly-dressed people in their 30s and 40s.\n\nArticle: Radio is the most popular medium.

We can't do this by ourselves,\"he said.\n\nIndustry commentator Declan McCullagh, who is chief potlicial writer for online news site CNET.com, believes the idea of doing nothing is untenable.\n\n\"Before we get to the stage of having to launch a cyber war, and that will eventually come, lets have a public discussion about what this involves,\"he said. \n\n\"A Geneva Convention for cyber war makes sense at least to start that discussion.\n\n\"What that would do is put certain types of attacks off the table like you are not going to target the enemy's hospitals or certain types of civilian systems that innocents depend on for their livelihood.\n\n\"I don't think everyone is going to respect it, and maybe the US won't respect it at times, but at least it starts the discussion and will probably have a positive effect,\"said Mr McCullagh.\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the RSA event, which began as a purely technical cryptography conference and has evolved into a broader forum that includes issues of policy and governance as well as technology.\nTL;DR: The threat of cyber warfare is greatly exaggerated, according to a leading security expert.\n\nArticle: Interior Minister Fred Matiang'i told reporters they would stay closed until investigations were complete.\n\nShortly after he spoke, opposition MP Tom Kajwang was arrested.\n\nMr Kajwang played a prominent role in Tuesday's ceremony naming Raila Odinga as\"the people's president\".\n\nThe outspoken MP had donned a lawyer's robe and wig, to the amusement of thousands of cheering opposition supporters in Uhuru park, in the capital Nairobi. \n\nIt is unclear what charges he will face.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said in a statement circulating on social media that broadcasting the event - described as an attempt to\"subvert or overthrow\"the government -\"would have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent Kenyans\".\n\nAs a result, NTV, KTN and Citizen TV were taken off-air at around 09:10 (06:10 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nKenyan journalists denounced the move as outrageous and in a statement called for\"respect of the constitution\"and an end to the\"unprecedented intimidation of journalists\".\n\nThe regulatory body, the Media Council of Kenya, described the recent turn of events as\"the greatest threat and assault on freedom of expression and media in Kenya's recent history\", saying there was no need to keep the media houses closed while an investigation was ongoing.\n\n\"This shutdown erodes the gains so far made in developing a free and responsible media industry and should never happen in a robust democracy that Kenya boasts of,\"the organisation said in a Facebook post.\"As guaranteed by the Kenyan Constitution, media freedom should be guarded jealously at all times.\"\n\nBut the Interior Ministry said it was a\"serious breach of security\".\n\nMr Matiang'i told reporters:\"As a result of what happened yesterday, we have commenced investigations targeting individuals. Media houses will remain closed until we complete investigations.\"\n\nMr Odinga held his own\"inauguration\"after claiming he was the rightful winner of last year's election.\n\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta was sworn in for a second term last November. He won an election re-run in October, but Mr Odinga boycotted it.\n\nMr Kenyatta's initial victory was overturned by the Supreme Court, citing\"irregularities and illegalities\".\n\nThe inauguration event in Uhuru park was attended by thousands of supporters, and went off peacefully.\n\nCitizen TV live streamed the event on its website, and on YouTube and Facebook.\nTL;DR: Three of Kenya's biggest television stations will remain off-air until further notice because they had planned to broadcast the opposition leader's unofficial \"inauguration\" in Nairobi.\n\nArticle: The game, which involves people filming themselves downing alcohol and then nominating someone else to continue, has been linked to several deaths.\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) called Neknominate a\"totally irresponsible craze\".\n\nIt said social media companies have a responsibility to show health warnings.\n\nEarlier this month, an inquest heard that police plan to speak to a person who\"Neknominated\"20-year-old Isaac Richardson, who collapsed and died after drinking a cocktail involving a\"large amount\"of alcoholic drinks at the hostel where he worked in Woolwich, south-east London.\n\nHe was reported to be the first British victim of the Neknominate game.\n\nOn Wednesday, the industry-funded charity Drinkaware called on parents to take a tough stance against the game over fears that young teenagers are under pressure to take part.\n\nNow the LGA - which represents nearly 400 councils in England and Wales - has called on social networking sites to\"show leadership\"and not ignore what is happening on their sites.\n\nKatie Hall, chair of the LGA's community wellbeing board, said:\"This is an utterly reckless and totally irresponsible craze which has tragically claimed lives. More should be done to highlight the dangers and persuade people not to participate.\n\n\"We believe social media operators have a responsibility to provide health warnings to user groups and individuals.\n\n\"We are urging Facebook and Twitter executives to sit down with us and discuss a way forward which tackles this issue head-on.\"\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\nTL;DR: Social networking sites Facebook and Twitter should introduce warnings over the drinking game Neknominate, councils in England and Wales have said.\n\nArticle: The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert implied it was possible for customers to leave a contract at any time.\n\nHowever, people are only allowed to quit during the initial 30-day period.\n\nVodafone said it would make sure its 30-day rule was clear in its marketing.\n\nThe ASA acted after complaints from 11 customers, who challenged the advert.\n\nClearcast, which pre-approves most British television advertising, said that Vodafone wanted to highlight that its service guarantee was for 30 days, whereas other companies only allowed customers a 15-day period of grace.\n\nIn the advert, Freeman's character says,\"I haven't got the strength to keep arguing with you\", before a few seconds later, adding,\"I'm leaving\".\n\nA voice from the phone immediately replies:\"You can't leave, you're still within your contract.\"\n\nA voiceover then states:\"Breaking up's never easy. But unlike other networks, Vodafone has a 30-day service guarantee, so if you don't love us you can leave us.\"\n\nThe ASA ruled that the advert was ambiguous regarding when the 30-day rule applied and felt it suggested that customers could leave whenever they wanted.\n\nIt accepted that Vodafone had published the address of its terms and conditions website page in a caption, but felt that did not change the impression given.\n\nThe authority ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and told the company its future advertising must not misleadingly imply that its service guarantee applied at any time.\n\nA Vodafone spokesperson said:\"Our'love us or leave us' 30-day service guarantee is the best in the market. We already make clear that the 30 days is from the start of a customer's contract in our terms and conditions, and will also make sure this is totally clear in our marketing.\"\n\nNissan ad'misleading'\n\nIt is the second Vodafone advert featuring Freeman to be banned by the ASA.\n\nLast month, the ASA banned a Vodafone ad which the regulator said misled customers about lagging broadband speeds and discounts on bills.\n\nIn February, another Vodafone advert with Freeman, about the ability to make emergency calls from an area with no signal, was cleared by the ASA.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the authority announced it had banned an advert for the Nissan Leaf electric car, which it said was misleading customers - in this case about the amount of time needed to charge the vehicle.\n\nFollowing a BBC investigation three people complained, and the ASA ruled that the advert did not convey the potential degree of variability in achieving a certain amount of charge.\n\nIt said:\"We concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were likely to mislead.\"\n\nNissan said:\"We were very disappointed with the ruling made by the ASA, although of course we will respect their decision.\n\n\"We constantly review and react to customer feedback to ensure that we are giving the very best possible service and information.\"\nTL;DR: A Vodafone advert starring Martin Freeman, in which the actor seems to be breaking up with his partner but is really trying to leave the phone firm, has been banned for being misleading.\n\nArticle: Mr Trump told reporters before leaving Washington there were\"a lot of things going on\"in the UK at the moment.\n\nHe said he got on well with Mrs May and had\"always liked\"Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday.\n\nMr Trump arrives on Thursday after attending the Nato summit.\n\nThe US President is set to arrive in the UK on the same day as the government publishes its White Paper setting out in more detail Mrs May's controversial offer to the EU on future relations after Brexit.\n\nBoth Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has also quit, have expressed fears it will tie the UK too closely to the EU and make it harder to do trade deals with countries like the US. \n\nThe US president has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March 2019.\n\nAsked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. \n\n\"It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,\"he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. \n\n\"We will work it out and all countries will be happy.\n\n\"So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil.\"\n\nMr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday\"may be the easiest of all\". \n\nAsked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. \n\n\"I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship.

I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him.\"\n\nThe ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the\"Brexit dream was dying\", has spoken of his\"increasing admiration\"for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. \n\nAsked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a\"positive impression\".\n\nHe said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington.  \n\nThe BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. \n\nDuring his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle.\n\nProtests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. \n\nMrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him.\n\nAfter being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a\"dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world\".\n\nMr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. \n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no\"hard border\"on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough.\n\n\"If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,\"he told the Irish Parliament.\"I think perhaps we are now entering into that space.\"\n\nAnd speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a\"very ambitious\"free trade deal with the UK. \n\nThe Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence.\n\nMr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to\"protect\"Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. \n\nThe US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets.  \n\nBut Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, hit back, saying the EU spent more on defence than either Russia or China.\nTL;DR: The UK is in \"turmoil\" and \"it is up to the people\" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister, Donald Trump has said ahead of his first visit to the country as US President.\n\nArticle: The Pontypridd MP said he was standing down for\"personal and political reasons\".\n\nIn a letter to Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Smith said it had been a\"great honour\"to serve the south Wales constituency.\n\nMr Corbyn had previously sacked Mr Smith from the Labour frontbench after he criticised his position on Brexit.\n\nThe Welsh Labour MP made a failed bid to topple Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2016.\n\nMr Corbyn made him shadow Northern Ireland secretary but sacked him from that role in March last year, after Mr Smith called for Labour to back another EU referendum. \n\nEarlier this year, Mr Smith said he and a\"lot of people\"were considering leaving Labour over the party's stance on Brexit.\n\nAnalysis by BBC Wales parliamentary correspondent Mark Hutchings \n\nTo say Owen Smith had his differences with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be putting it mildly.\n\nHis failed bid to oust him as leader in 2016 ended with a handshake.

But that was then.

He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago.\n\nBut the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated.  \n\nAnimosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead. \n\nOn Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz.\n\nThe region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region.\n\nWhat happened in the attack on Eritrea?\n\nOn Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet.\n\nTigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days. \n\nThe Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there.\n\nOn Sunday, in a tweet, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was\"more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself\".\n\nBut while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true.\n\nAnalysis: Two men with a common enemy\n\nBy Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor\n\nWith missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region.\n\nBut many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed  became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki.\n\nNow the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead.  \n\nInternational calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan.\n\nHow bad is the violence?\n\nHundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week. \n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that\"scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death\"in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday.\n\nPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.\n\nWhy are the government and TPLF fighting?\n\nThe TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. \n\nLast year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.\n\nThe feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.\n\nTigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.\n\nIt also resents what it calls the prime minister's\"unprincipled\"friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.\n\nMr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.\n\nThe prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.\n\nMr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed\"the last red line\".  He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action\"treasonous\". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.\nTL;DR: The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated.\n\nArticle: \"We have to make the most\"of the opportunity, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told the BBC.\n\nThe two Koreas earlier agreed to march under a\"unified Korea\"flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South.\n\nThe talks come as the US and its allies vowed to keep pressure on the North.\n\nOn Wednesday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said sanctions were\"really starting to hurt\", expressing confidence that the pressure would eventually force the North to the negotiating table over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump said that America would destroy North Korea if forced to defend itself or its allies.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent\"charm offensive\".\n\n\"It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,\"Mr Kono said, Reuters news agency reported.\"The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump accused Russia of undermining international sanctions against North Korea.\n\n\"Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea,\"he told Reuters.\"What China is helping us with, Russia is denting.\"\n\nWhat is Seoul's negotiating stance?\n\nMs Kang told the BBC:\"I think we understand North Korea better than anybody, having dealt with North Korea for decades, having had series of discussions off and on.\n\n\"We haven't had any significant engagement in the recent past - but this is an opportunity.\n\n\"You can have all kinds of theories of why there are here (at the talks). There are, obviously, calculations going on the part of the North Korea decision-makers as to their actions.\n\n\"But in the end we have to make the most of it.\"\n\nMs Kang also said South Korea and its allies were\"very much on the same page\"regarding the longer term - the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\n\nAnd the foreign minister said Seoul wanted more humanitarian aid to be sent to North Korea as sanctions were beginning to take effect.\n\nWhat has been agreed about the Olympics?\n\nIf the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could attend the Winter Olympics.\n\nIt will mean the opening of the cross-border road for the first time in almost two years.\n\nThe two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together.\n\nThe Games will take place in February in Pyeongchang.\n\nThe North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March.\n\nThe agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify.\n\nSouth Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials.\n\nWhat has the reaction been in South Korea?\n\nSouth Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal.\n\nTens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan.\n\nBut the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. \n\nHow did the deal come about?\n\nThe talks came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades.\n\nThis is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years.\n\nIts latest ballistic missile test, in November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel.\n\nSoon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was\"open to dialogue\". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. \n\nThe breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation came on 9 January.\n\nIt was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated.\n\nCould the Olympics help peace talks?\n\nAnalysts say the sudden and dramatic change after months of tension between the Koreas is a positive sign. But few believe Pyongyang has any intention of giving up its nuclear arsenal or halting tests.\n\nExperts say Kim Jong-un has become increasingly fearful that the US is planning a military strike against him, and has decided he must do something to de-escalate tensions.\n\nSouth Korea's president must try to engage the North in genuine dialogue, while not upsetting his very sceptical American ally.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the inter-Korean talks can provide a starting point for tackling bigger problems - there may be a lull during the Olympics, but what happens after that is far from clear.\n\nPrevious efforts at rapprochement - notably the Sunshine Policy 20 years ago - did not lead to peace.\nTL;DR: South Korea says it will continue high-level talks with North Korea with \"clear eyes\" amid global warnings that Pyongyang might be playing for time to continue its nuclear-arms programme.\n\nArticle: Energy firm SSE, which is involved in the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm project, said a total of 86 clusters of four piles would eventually be installed.\n\nThey will provide support for 84 turbines and two offshore transformer modules.\n\nThe piles are being installed on the seabed by a large crane ship.\n\nThe Stanislav Yudin has a 2,500-tonne, 110m (360ft) revolving crane.\n\nA number of support vessels are also involved in the work.\n\nThe remainder of the piles are expected to be installed by the end of October.\n\nThe Beatrice Offshore Windfarm is being constructed in the Outer Moray Firth at a cost of \u00a32.6bn. \n\nEnergy firm SSE is among the scheme's investors.\n\nAll images are copyrighted.\nTL;DR: More than half of the foundation piles needed for supporting turbines for a massive offshore wind farm in the Moray Firth have been installed.\n\nArticle: The Doctor Who star will be directed by the award-winning Ondi Timoner in the biopic simply titled Mapplethorpe, according to Deadline. \n\n Zosia Mamet, known for the HBO comedy-drama Girls, has been cast to play Patti Smith, Mapplethorpe's one-time lover and best friend.\n\nMapplethorpe became famous with his shocking sexual images of New York.\n\nHe was very much a documenter of life throughout the 1970s and 80s and his instrument of choice was for a long time a Polaroid instant camera, rather than a sophisticated multi-lens alternative.\n\nIn an interview in 1988 with the publication Artnews, Mapplethorpe said of his work:\"I don't like that particular word'shocking'. \n\n\"I'm looking for the unexpected.

In future they will talk to us and we will listen.\"\n\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Lord Hall announced the following innovations, although he noted the biggest changes would have to be submitted to the BBC Trust for approval:\n\nLord Hall said that, while the BBC was continuing to make savings following the licence fee freeze, his plans would require\"another \u00a3100m a year\"- which the BBC will have to find by redirecting\"resources, money [and] people\".\n\nHe also praised the strength of BBC News, saying:\"While I want BBC News to be alive to its critics, I don't want BBC News to be cowed by them.\"\n\n\"We are going to show the British public, who pay for this service, that we know - and will never again forget - what we are here to do.\n\n\"The people of this country make a bold and generous commitment in paying for the BBC.

We are doing well.\"\n\nSo Ireland will be the first of the bailed-out countries to step free from its economy being overseen by the troika - the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. \n\nThere will be quiet satisfaction in the corridors of Brussels and Berlin. They will grasp the moment as providing evidence that the medicine of bailouts, austerity and reforming labour markets can work. In their frequent praise for Ireland they can scarcely disguise their gratitude. \n\nNation's'shame'\n\nIt is worth recalling the mood in Ireland back in November 2010. The Irish government had rescued reckless banks, taken on their debts, and was struggling to finance itself. Dublin created a\"war room\"to fight off the humiliation of a bailout.  Sunday, 21 November was the reckoning. Ireland accepted an 85bn-euro (\u00a371bn; $117bn) rescue. \n\nWith the bailout came a national shudder, with the Irish Times, in its editorial, borrowing a headline from a poem by WB Yeats and asking\"Was it for this?\"There were many who shared the paper's lament\"the shame of it all\". \n\n\"Having obtained our political independence from Britain to be masters of our own affairs,\"the lament continued,\"we have surrendered our sovereignty to the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund\". The Irish finance minister at the time told the BBC that it felt like\"hell was at the gates\".\n\nThat was just over three years ago, but the shamed Celtic Tiger knuckled down. The government cut nearly 30bn euros in spending and raised taxes. Salaries were squeezed by 20% and benefits even for unemployment and disability were reduced. \n\nThe country, with its low corporate tax rate, became the hi-tech gateway into Europe for companies like Google, Paypal and Facebook. Gradually Ireland returned to growth. It is expected to hit 1.8% next year. Unemployment, although still at 12.5%, is falling.  \n\nSocial problems \n\nVictory, however, has been bought at some cost. \n\nIt is claimed that the poorest have borne the brunt of the cuts. The think-tank Social Justice Ireland claims the poorest 10% have lost a fifth of all their income; that is harsher than for other groups in society. \n\nHomelessness has increased by 20% since 2010. In a major survey, Growing up in Ireland found that 60% of families were experiencing difficulties in making ends meet - double the number from four years before. And 13% are behind with paying utility bills. A very significant number of homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages. \n\nAnd then there is emigration. The writer Fintan O'Toole once said that\"mass emigration had always been the index of Ireland's failure\". It is back. Last year more than 75,000 left the country. And 200,000 have gone since 2008.  Some moved to the UK, but many headed west to Canada and the US as previous generations had done. \n\nEmigration helped disguise the unemployment. Some have even suggested that the government actually encouraged emigration.\n\nGoing forward there will have to be another round of cuts and it will take decades to pay back the loans. But investors have rediscovered their faith in Ireland. \n\nIt may be that Portugal and eventually Greece will follow Ireland in throwing off the bailout\"straitjacket\". But for Europe two questions follow: will hundreds of thousands of young people across Europe have to look outside the continent for work? And have the years of austerity weakened Social Europe which, previously, had been one of its defining features?\nTL;DR: This weekend marks an important milestone for the eurozone.

Like her, he wanted children... but he was in no rush.\n\n\"He was aimless. He wanted to wait until he felt better about his life and his career. You just think,'Come on!'\"Jessica says.\n\nShe had wanted children since she turned 30 and was envious of friends who were starting families. She was also shaken by a visit to her aunt in hospital. Her aunt didn't have children, and Jessica believed she had been ignored by doctors as there had been no-one to insist on better care.\n\n\"I thought there was a risk of me ending up in a similar situation if I had no kids of my own. They can act as insurance for when you get older.\"\n\nShe ended her relationship with David in March 2016 and almost immediately started dating her colleague, Scott. He was keen to have a baby, but after six months of trying they had nothing to show for it. So they went to a GP, who suggested blood tests - and while Jessica's results were clear, Scott's revealed a range of fertility issues.\n\n\"He didn't react well to the news and basically fell apart. I didn't feel I had the ability to support him through it,\"Jessica says.\"Also I didn't really want to go through IVF.\"\n\nThey split up after a make-or-break Christmas holiday in 2016.\n\nJessica then spoke to a gynaecologist, who suggested artificial insemination using donor sperm. Jessica wanted her child to have a caring father, so she wasn't keen on the idea, but she discussed it with a friend anyway.\n\n\"She asked,'Why would you spend \u00a3700 for sperm when you could go down to Yates's [wine bar] and find someone who would gladly give you it for free?'\"Jessica says. \n\n\"But I didn't want to go to a pub and have unprotected sex with someone who'd had no STD checks. I also didn't want to entrap someone into parenthood.\"\n\nHowever, this prompted her to post an advert on a co-parenting website. Scrolling through the potential fathers, she came across quite a few married gay couples, but feared she'd lose out as one among three parents.\n\n\"I was worried a 50-50 split would soon become 70-30 in their favour,\"she says.\n\nShe then started chatting to a single man on the website, until an insurmountable barrier got in the way - Brexit.\n\n\"He voted to leave Europe and I'm very much for remain,\"Jessica says.\"I said,'I'm not really sure we can parent like this.'\"\n\nJessica quit the website, which charged a monthly fee, and considered dating apps. But as a teacher she didn't want to post a photograph of herself. Then she thought about Craigslist.\n\n\"I didn't want to use a dating website or Tinder in case a student saw a picture of me. Plus I knew Craigslist got a lot of traffic and was free to use,\"she says.\n\nShe typed out her advert on the bus to Oxford Street last March, and posted it in the personals section.\n\n\"I don't use turkey basters when cooking and am not using one at conception,\"one line read.\n\n\"God, it sounds completely crazy looking back,\"Jessica says.\n\nShe didn't set many parameters for the potential father of her child, only height, age and sexual health.\n\n\"I just wanted to meet a good person with shared values,\"she says.\n\nShe received a flurry of replies, including the obligatory slew of penis pictures. A number of men wrote claiming they had helped several women, which turned Jessica off.\n\n\"The last thing I needed was for my child to end up at a party and snog their sibling without knowing,\"Jessica says.\n\nAnother young man wrote to say he was desperate for a baby after his previous partner had a miscarriage. Jessica felt he was too vulnerable.\n\nThen she received an email from Ross.\n\n\"He was 33 and also lived in London. He said he'd had some disastrous relationships but he loved being an uncle and wanted children of his own,\"Jessica says.\n\nThey agreed to meet for drinks that evening.\n\n\"I thought he was much better-looking in person than the photo he sent,\"she says.\n\nThey discovered they were of different faiths but agreed they wanted a\"London approach\"to religion.\n\n\"We agreed there was one God who loved pretty much everybody and we would want a child to be comfortable with people of any faith or no faith.\"\n\nJessica and Ross kissed at the end of their first meeting.\"I felt very comfortable around him,\"she says.\n\nA few days later they had dinner and arranged to have STD checks. After their fourth date they decided to have sex, to see if they were physically compatible.\n\n\"It was really good,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"We decided to start trying for a baby, knowing it could take a while.\"\n\nBut within weeks Jessica was holding a positive pregnancy test. She had conceived during her very next cycle.\n\n\"I found out I was pregnant about six weeks after I'd posted the advert,\"Jessica says.\"That was a bit of a surprise. It definitely wasn't what I had expected.\"\n\nThere hadn't even been time for Ross to get a sperm count.\n\nThey didn't have a written contract but agreed they wouldn't sleep with anyone else.\n\n\"I didn't want to label what my relationship with Ross was,\"Jessica says.\"I was delighted I was pregnant but I was wary that might make me think I was in love with him.\"\n\nYou may also like:\n\nWhy don't I want to have sex with the man I love?\n\nHollie McNish: The things new mothers aren't always told\n\nWhy I chose to donate my eggs\n\nRoss was very involved during the pregnancy and accompanied Jessica to hospital appointments. It wasn't all plain sailing, though.\n\nThey clashed about who got to keep the original ultrasound pictures and whether to spend money finding out the sex of the baby early.\n\nHowever, this led Jessica to an unexpected discovery. She had advertised for a father for her baby rather than a partner, but the quarrels made her realise that she actually had feelings for Ross.\n\n\"I realised being angry with him made me sad, as I did love him.\n\n\"But I was concerned that perhaps he was caring and attentive just because I was carrying his baby.\"\n\nThe couple told their parents Jessica was expecting a baby after the pregnancy had lasted 12 weeks, but didn't reveal how they had met.\n\n\"Our families get on well. It may be because there was a child involved but everyone was very accepting and tolerant of each other,\"Jessica says.\n\nJessica had been living alone and Ross moved in two months before their baby was due.\n\nShe had a Caesarean after her baby was found to be in a breech position, and spent a week recovering in hospital.\n\n\"Ross slept on a sleeping bag on the floor next to me the whole time. There was another dad there but he lasted one night before he said it was too uncomfortable and went home.\"\n\nHaving a newborn baby has left Jessica and Ross\"bone-achingly tired\".\n\nHowever, Jessica thinks that if anything their relationship has got stronger.\n\n\"We're coping and getting through it - maybe it's because we don't have the energy to argue!\"\n\nJessica is on maternity leave and Ross can work some days from home. It means they share a lot of the parenting duties.\n\n\"It's great, when there is a particularly icky nappy, being able to hand the baby over to dad and say,'This is yours,'\"Jessica says.\n\nThe couple have now been together just under a year and parents for two months. They are still discovering new things about each other.\n\n\"Like the other day in a text conversation I found out he liked Billie Holiday,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"It's great when we get time together and we always have a meal when he gets back from work. We enjoy being together and it makes it easier raising a child.\"\n\nThey have already discussed having another.\n\nJessica says she is pleased she went down an unconventional route to starting a family.\n\n\"I don't regret the advert,\"she says.\n\n\"I don't think you can get what you want by sitting there patiently and waiting for it to land in your lap.\"\n\nAll names have been changed\n\nClaire Bates is tweeting @batesybates\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\nTL;DR: Ten months ago, thirty-something Jessica was eager to get pregnant.

They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen.\n\n\"Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy,\"Bank of England governor Mark Carney said.\n\nWhat is a'disorderly Brexit'?\n\nThe Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit.\n\nThe Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening.\n\nWhat happens during this disorderly scenario?\n\nScenarios drawn up by the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast.\n\nGrowth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before.\n\nUnemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%.\n\nInterest rates would reach 4%.\n\nWhat other scenarios did the Bank of England consider?\n\nThe Bank looked at three other scenarios.\n\nA close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services.\n\nA less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place.\n\nWhat happens in these scenarios?\n\nIf Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75%\n\nIf a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate.\n\nIf it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report.\n\nThese figures cover the period to 2023.\n\nWhat does this mean for Theresa May?\n\nBy political reporter Brian Wheeler\n\nTheresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her.

The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nConservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight\"lack all credibility\". \n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said\"project fear\"had become\"project hysteria\". \n\nAnd the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said:\"The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land.\"\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said:\"The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,\"he said.\n\nWhat else did the Bank say?\n\nMr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary.\n\nHe also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great.\n\nBut he warned there was little the Bank could do.\n\n\"There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,\"he said.\n\nWhat does it mean for the banking sector?\n\nThe Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.\n\nAll seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test.\nTL;DR: A no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned.\n\nArticle: Weighing in at 2.335kg (5lbs) - about four times the size of a normal hedgehog - it was handed in to a rescue centre in Aberdeenshire.\n\nNow named Arbuckle, the hedgehog could barely walk or form a defensive ball.\n\nKeith Marley, of The New Arc Animal Rescue Centre, near Ellon, said:\"He's about the size of a World Cup football, after overfeeding.\"\n\nMr Marley said it was the heaviest hedgehog they could find a record of.\n\nHe told the BBC Scotland news website:\"We were really surprised by his size and weight, as the average is about 600g.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\"The person who contacted us said he was feeding hedgehogs but this one stayed and refused to go - this may well have been due to the fact he could hardly walk.\n\n\"He will be fed a restricted diet which is filling, and scatter his food around for exercise.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.  However, younger trees (10-30 years old) are at greater risk and can succumb to the disease in just a few years.\n\nDrs Straw and Williams described BCD as a\"much more serious threat\"because the\"rate at which the disease has spread through the horse chestnut populations has shown no sign of slowing down in recent years, and it is still too early to say how many trees will be killed eventually and how many might survive\".\n\nContrary to the opinion that trees with foliage damage caused by leaf miners would be more susceptible to BCD and help accelerate its spread, Dr Straw said the decade-long study did not support such a view.\n\n\"Trees that have heavily damage foliage by the leaf miner do not get the (bleeding canker) disease more often and they do not suffer from it any more severely so we cannot see that the impact of the leaf miner is causing sufficient stress in the trees to make them more susceptible to the disease,\"he explained. \n\n\"The two organisms seem to be operating independently.\"\n\nDr Straw said Forest Research scientists had been concerned by attempts to treat horse chestnut trees with insecticides in order to curb the spread of leaf miners.\n\n\"This was based on the argument that by controlling the moth you would help stop the trees from becoming infected with bleeding canker disease,\"he added. \n\n\"What we have shown is that there is no point doing that.

I've been working on this vaccine for 30 years and this is a dream come true.\"\n\nThe company has not revealed the price of the vaccine, but has pledged not to make a profit from it.\n\nIt has been designed specifically to combat malaria infection in children in Africa and will not be licensed for travellers. \n\nEarlier this year, final results of a clinical trial in seven African countries yielded mixed results.\n\nThe best protection was among children aged five to 17 months who received three doses of the vaccine a month apart, plus a booster dose at 20 months.\n\nIn this group, cases of severe malaria were cut by a third over four years.\n\nBut the effectiveness of the vaccine waned over time, making the booster shot essential. \n\nWithout a booster the vaccine did not cut the rate of severe malaria over the trial period.\n\nAnd disappointingly, the jab did not prove very effective in protecting young babies from severe malaria.\n\nThis presents a dilemma for the WHO, which will decide in October whether the vaccine should be deployed,  because it is not nearly as effective as scientists would have hoped.\n\nFurthermore, it had been hoped the jab could be administered at six, 10 and 14 weeks, along with other childhood vaccines.\n\nBut the results suggest the jabs need to be started later, which would involve a huge amount of organisation and extra cost as it is outside the childhood vaccine schedule.\n\nFurthermore, the trial results show it is crucial that children receive all four doses of the jab in order to benefit.\n\nBut even a partially effective malaria vaccine could have a role to play in countries with very high rates of disease.\n\nGSK began research on a malaria vaccine 30 years ago and the first trials in Africa began in 1998.\n\nIn 2001 a partnership was established between GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with the aim of accelerating development of malaria vaccines.\n\nIn 2009 11 centres began recruiting 16,000 children in seven sub-Saharan African countries:  Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. \n\nSteve Davis, president and CEO of PATH, said:\"Today marks a significant scientific milestone for the long-standing partnership to develop a vaccine, yet several more steps remain before a malaria vaccine might reach the young children in Africa who most need protection against this deadly human parasite.\"\n\nThe vaccine works by triggering the immune system to defend against the first stages of infection by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite after it enters the bloodstream following a mosquito bite.\n\nProf Adrian Hill of the Jenner Institute, Oxford, said he was pleased and encouraged by the EMA's decision but added that the vaccine was not a\"magic bullet\".\n\nHe said:\"A bed net is more effective than this vaccine, but nonetheless it is a very significant scientific achievement.\n\n\"I see it as a building block towards much more effective malaria vaccines in years to come.\"\nTL;DR: The world's first malaria vaccine has cleared one of the final hurdles prior to being approved for use in Africa.\n\nArticle: The event runs from Friday to Sunday with a wide range of concerts, comedy and community activities planned.\n\nAs part of a drive to get more people enjoying Burns Suppers, a special mascot -

and even if they have booked an appointment they do not know which vaccine they will be offered. \n\nAt 32 weeks pregnant Giuditta is now worried she will not be able to be vaccinated before she gives birth and is concerned about the risk of catching Covid-19 in hospital. \n\n\"In my case, I know that in six weeks' time, I'm going to be taken into hospital, and I'm going to have a booked C-section. And I'm going to have to spend two or three days there,\"she said. \n\n\"It would really make a huge difference if I was able to have at least the first dose of the vaccine before getting into hospital.\"\n\n\"The whole process is proving incredibly stressful, which is something that in theory, you shouldn't experience in pregnancy,\"she added. \n\nOn 16 April, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, said pregnant women should get the coronavirus vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population, based on their age and any underlying health conditions. \n\nThere is no evidence to suggest other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women but more research is needed. \n\nReal-world data from the US shows around 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated, mainly with mRNA vaccines such as the Pfizer and Modern jabs, without any safety concerns being raised. \n\nBased on this data, the JCVI says it is preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines where available.\n\nThey are also encouraged to discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccines with their doctor before making the appointment.\n\nAn NHS England spokesman said:\"Following the updated guidance set out by the JCVI, the NHS immediately communicated the advice to GPs. \n\n\"If you're pregnant, or think you might be, speak to your maternity team or GP surgery to discuss your vaccine appointment so that it can be arranged at a site offering the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, which is preferable for pregnant women.\"\n\nAlthough pregnant women are at no greater risk of being infected by the virus, they are more likely to have complications from Covid-19.\n\nData shows that one in five pregnant women who become unwell with Covid needs to have her baby delivered early.\nTL;DR: Pregnant women are struggling to get the coronavirus vaccine because clinics are unable to guarantee they will have the right type of jab available, Labour MP Stella Creasy has said.\n\nArticle: By Chris MasonPolitical correspondent, BBC News\n\nTitans of their trade as big as the brand they represented.\n\nFor those two knights of Manchester United and Radio 2, read Nigel Farage and UKIP.\n\nEnter the working class boy from Bootle, Paul Nuttall.\n\nWill he be the David Moyes of politics, the former Manchester United manager who also made his name on Merseyside but turned out to be a crushing disappointment soon to be shuffled off the stage?\n\nOr will he be the Chris Evans instead, accepting the apparently impossible inheritance, replacing the mega star, but matching, even eclipsing his popularity?\n\nOn the face of it, the challenge for Paul Nuttall is colossal.\n\nFinding a purpose for a party that has achieved the very thing it was set up to achieve, getting the UK out of the European Union.\n\nDo so via an electoral system for council and Westminster seats, first past the post, which makes it mighty hard for small parties to breakthrough.\n\nOh, and leading a party with a penchant for volcanic eruptions of internal argument, with the odd dust up occasionally thrown in for good measure.\n\nHis pitch for the future goes like this: the electoral honeypot is to be found in the urban north of England, the geographical epicentre of Labour's heartlands.\n\nLabour there is a political mega brand.

I get 50% less than what I should be getting,\"Mr Sullivan said.\n\nHe claimed some miners are on less than \u00a310 a week.\n\nThe NUM's Mr Thomas said his union wanted to retain the government guarantee but wanted to see a review of the 50/50 surplus split.\n\n\"The people who we are dealing with in the mining communities don't want handouts. They don't want to rely on the state,\"he said.\n\n\"But I am dealing with a lot who are on the state because their pensions are low.\n\n\"If we had some of the surplus back to trustees we would be able to boost their pensions.\"\n\nPaul Davies, of the Welsh Conservatives, said in a Senedd debate that it was\"crucial that a pension scheme of this nature is guaranteed by the UK government\".\n\nHe added:\"It's quite clear that the UK government has received substantial amounts of money and that's why we believe it is appropriate that a review takes place.\"\n\nUKIP group leader Neil Hamilton said:\"It is right that any surplus should be shared with the government.\n\n\"But the 50/50 split now looks very far from a definition of fairness.\"\n\nA Plaid Cymru motion calling for a review was passed unopposed.\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said First Minister Carwyn Jones had written to the UK government supporting the NUM's call for a review.\n\nHe added:\"The first minister has also called on the UK government to clarify its position on the reserve fund that has been created out of the surpluses, developed in part to support the remaining deep mining industry. \n\n\"The Welsh Government supports the NUM's call for this to be put back into the scheme for the benefit of the retired miners and coal industry workers.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said:\"The government continues to guarantee that pensions will be paid. \n\n\"Members have received pensions approximately 30% larger than would have been the case without the guarantee and these will continue to rise in line with inflation.\"\nTL;DR: Former miners in Wales are calling for a review of their pension fund, arguing they should be awarded a larger share of surplus money.\n\nArticle: Clearing, a system run by the university admissions service Ucas, matches students with remaining places.\n\nBut admissions officers have said demand outstrips supply for the places, which become available on Tuesday when pupils get their exam results.\n\nMore than 160,000 young Scots will get their results on Tuesday.\n\nTraditionally applicants who narrowly fail to secure the Higher passes they needed for their first choice course, can enter the clearing system to try for alternative courses.\n\nBut for several years many of the ancient universities have had virtually no places due to some rationalisation of courses and increased demand in Scotland and from other EU countries.\n\nAdvice line\n\nEdinburgh Napier and the University of the West of Scotland have some availability as does the University of the Highlands and Islands which has government funding for an extra 1,000 spaces in its many centres.\n\nSkills Development Scotland have set up a dedicated careers advice line, which opens at 08:00 on Tuesday.\n\nDamien Yeates, SDS chief executive, said:\"As always our advice is not to panic -

for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.\n\nA host of big mortgage lenders have started, or promised to offer, new products under the scheme, although the UK's biggest building society - the Nationwide - has not decided on whether it will sign up.\n\nCritics have suggested that these products would fuel an artificial housing bubble and expressed concerns about how it will be brought to an end, prompting the chancellor to ask the Bank to keep a close eye on it.\n\nThe Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is able to modify parts of the Help to Buy scheme to keep it in check.\n\nIt can reduce the \u00a3600,000 cap on properties under the scheme, so that fewer homes are affected. It can also also make loans less attractive by recommending that the Treasury raises the fees paid by lenders for the guarantees.\n\nThe chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, has now written to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, asking him to outline the Bank's role and how it would keep itself detached from government policy on the scheme.\n\n\"The scope and limits of the Bank's role in this scheme need a good deal of clarification, both to safeguard the Bank's authority to act in fulfilment of its statutory responsibility for financial stability and to safeguard its independence,\"he said.\nTL;DR: An influential committee of MPs has asked the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble.\n\nArticle: It said the Welsh Government quango has failed to provide some services in Welsh and treated the language less favourably than English. \n\nTfW claimed no rules have been broken.\n\nIt said the company it has contracted to run the Wales and Borders franchise is going further than asked. The report is yet to be finalised.\n\nTfW oversees most of Wales' train services, and awarded the Wales and Borders contract to KeolisAmey in 2018.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it took its language commitments seriously and expected TfW to do the same.\n\nThe commissioner's office began a probe following complaints last year. It is not clear when the final version of the report will be published. \n\nThe draft report said six complaints were received by the commissioner from members of the public and other issues were investigated following reports in the media and by officers.\n\nWelsh ministers were given notice of the proposed scope of the investigation in January 2019. \n\nThe draft report has made findings which include that Welsh was treated less favourably than English on TfW self-service machines, its website and on its mobile app which is a breach of language standards.\n\nMinisters have been asked to act within three months of the final judgment being published. \n\nIf they fail to do so, the commissioner's office can make an application to a county court to makes it compulsory for ministers to comply with recommendations. \n\nDavid Williams from Cymdeithas yr Iaith, the Welsh language society, said:\"We've received lots of complaints from members and supporters because of these failings on our railways - it is obvious why people are so angry about the situation.\n\n\"It's not acceptable for the government to break the law and allow the company to deprive people of basic rights to see, hear and use Welsh in their everyday lives.\"\n\nWhat are the concerns?\n\nThe draft report said the company was found to be in breach of standards by: \n\nSuzy Davies AM, Welsh Conservatives spokesperson on the Welsh language, has criticised the way TfW is run by the Welsh Government. \n\n\"It seems that not only is this Labour administration incapable of running a rail service in Wales, but it is also incapable of providing services in both official languages of this nation,\"she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the commissioner said its investigation was\"not yet finalised, so it is not appropriate for us to make a further comment at this stage\".\n\nTransport for Wales said the agreement between Transport for Wales and KeolisAmey has\"clear Welsh language requirements\".\n\n\"These requirements are all either being met or there are agreed plans and timescales for implementation,\"a spokesman said.\n\n\"On that basis no rules have been broken as the contractual commitments are being adhered to and, in some cases, TfW Rail Services are going further than required by the grant agreement.\"\n\n'More to do'\n\nTfW north Wales development director Lee Robinson said:\"We recognise that there is more to do and [we] have ambitious and exciting plans, which we will share once the commissioners' report is finalised and agreed.  \n\n\"Updating our plans in line with the... recommendations will enable us to make sure that everything we publish is as comprehensive as possible and addresses all the remaining gaps.\n\n\"As a fully bilingual organisation, we recognise and support the importance of a thriving Welsh language and culture and believe that our customers should always have the opportunity to interact with us, equally, in both Welsh and English.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said:\"We take our commitment to Welsh language very seriously and expect Transport for Wales to do likewise. \n\n\"We will be monitoring TfW's response closely along with regular updates on Welsh language compliance.\"\nTL;DR: Transport for Wales (TfW) has broken Welsh language rules six times, according to a Welsh Language Commissioner's draft report.\n\nArticle: The aids have two parts - the child wears a receiver with their hearing aid and the person they want to hear wears a transmitter, filtering out background noise. \n\nThe National Deaf Children's Society says more councils should pay for them.\n\nBut the Local Government Association says funds are limited.\n\nLevindinos was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate hearing loss in both ears when he was just a few months old. \n\nBut he didn't have access to a radio aid until he was four, and struggled at nursery.\n\n\"He used to get into trouble a lot at the nursery he went to,\"says his mum Sophie.\n\n'Opportunities to learn'\n\nChildren with hearing loss may be given the \u00a31,000 devices at school, but the aids are less commonly funded for home use - so families can use them in the car and outdoors, or when the children are doing homework or other activities.\n\nThe Anastasiou family lives in Leyton, east London. Their local authority does not fund home radio aids, so Sophie decided to pay for one herself.\n\nShe says it has made a real difference.\n\n\"He's had a new lease of life, and many more opportunities to learn.\n\n\"Levindinos can take part; he's not left out. It makes a real difference because without them, he always wants to be close to me to make sure he can hear what I am saying. \n\n\"With them, he can cycle with his friends ahead of me, without having to lag behind so I can support him.\"\n\nShe says it's unfair that not all deaf children have similar access.\n\nThe National Deaf Children's Society estimates about 11,500 children live in 43 English council areas that do not fund the aids.\n\nIt says the situation has got better, with the number of councils providing them going up from 77 in 2016 to 109 now.\n\nThere are more than 45,000 deaf children in the UK altogether. In Northern Ireland, all children are entitled to home radio aids, while in Scotland and Wales most services do not offer them.\n\n'Tipping point'\n\nJo Campion, from the NDCS says:\"Thousands of young deaf children across the country are being thrown into a radio-aid lottery, where their chances of having one at home are based on their postcode, not on their needs. \n\n\"It's a tragic waste of potential and it's deeply unfair.\"\n\nShe added:\"Radio aids boost a child's chances of picking up language, reduce the effect of background noise and help in situations where face-to-face conversations are difficult, like playing outside or travelling in the car.\"\n\nBut Anntoinette Bramble, chairwoman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said:\"The National Deaf Children's Society is wrong to suggest that councils have a duty to supply radio aids.

Britain sold off many of its assets in the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s and also did not create a sovereign wealth fund from its oil revenues, which Norway did. \n\nOf leading industrialised countries, only Portugal's\"net worth\"was in a poorer position, the IMF said. \n\nThat could mean that Britain will have to raise more taxes in the future because government-owned asset growth will not provide as much support to the economy.\n\nThe Financial Stability Report is the second time in 24 hours the IMF has published sober warnings about the state of global finance.\n\nOn Monday, it downgraded world growth forecasts for next year, blaming new trade barriers.\n\nTuesday's report says governments should resist attempts to roll back banking regulations put in place in 2008 to stop a similar financial crisis happening again.\n\nComplacent\n\nPresident Donald Trump has already pushed through laws repealing banking rules in America for smaller institutions, saying they were holding back bank lending to businesses. \n\nThe IMF also warns market investors, who have seen the largest upward bull run in stocks in history.\n\nThe report says they are in danger of becoming complacent about the chances of an economic shock to the system.\n\nOne could be the ending of\"easy money\".\n\nCentral banks are starting to withdraw the stimulus that was put in place at the time of the financial crisis.\n\nInterest rates are rising and quantitative easing - money printing - being dialled back.\n\nThe IMF fears this could lead to sharp falls in markets.\n\nThe risks of a government funding crisis in Italy, where the country's banks are under pressure, is also highlighted.\n\n\"Looking ahead, clouds appear on the horizon,\"the report, published at the body's annual meeting in Bali, Indonesia, says.\n\n\"Support for multilateralism has been waning, a dangerous undercurrent that may undermine confidence in policymakers' ability to respond to future crises.\n\n\"Nonetheless,

strongly, encouraging international investors to move capital there and invest in the dollar.\n\nTo cool inflationary pressure, the American central bank, the Federal Reserve, is raising interest rates, which acts as a further attraction to global capital because returns are higher.\n\nThat puts pressure on emerging market economies such as Turkey and Argentina, which have large amounts of

oversaw health spending in the area, for documents relating to the outbreak.\n\nA PHE briefing note received through the request said:\"The most likely hypothesis as to cause of the outbreak is contact with, and spread via, district nursing services in the area.\"\n\nIt noted 31 of the 32 then-known cases had contact with district nurses in the preceding 14 days - most of those with Provide workers.\n\nHowever, no single nurse had contact with all cases and the most cases an individual had been in contact with was seven.\n\n'Excellent track record'\n\nWhen asked about the link to nurses on 26 June, the day the briefing note was circulated, PHE told the BBC\"we haven't as yet identified a cause\".\n\nThe outbreak was first identified in February in Braintree before spreading to Chelmsford and Maldon.\n\nFurther cases were retrospectively discovered dating back to December 2018.\n\nProvide said it had\"an excellent track record\"of infection prevention and had been working with the CCG, PHE and NHS England to understand how the infection spread and prevent it from doing so.\n\nIn a statement it said:\"Firstly, we would like to reiterate our sympathy and condolences to those affected by the outbreak. \n\n\"Identifying the exact cause of the outbreak is particularly complex. \n\n\"Not all cases had contact with our team. The majority of our patients are being treated in their own homes rather than in a contained setting such as a hospital where it is possible to control access and consistently maintain levels of infection control. \n\n\"Therefore, it may never be possible to identify the exact cause of the outbreak due to the number of factors involved.\"\n\nThe company added it was taking part in an independent investigation into the outbreak.\n\nThe CCG said Provide had been rated as\"outstanding\"by the Care Quality Commission in March and said while patients affected were receiving nursing care in the community it was unable to share any learning from the investigation at this time.\n\nIt said:\"To ensure we mitigated the risk of a wider spread of infection, additional enhanced infection prevention control measures were put in place by Provide and continue to be rigorously applied across the area.\"\n\nAfter the discovery of the outbreak nursing stations were deep cleaned and additional infection prevention measures were out in place, the CCG said.\nTL;DR: The \"most likely cause\" of a bacterial outbreak that has seen 15 people die was district nursing teams, a document obtained by the BBC has revealed.\n\nArticle: The five stamps, which feature images of dolmens from across the island, are the third in the Archaeology series.\n\nA dolmen is a type of stone grave dating from the Neolithic period usually made up of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal stone.\n\nSusanne Lowman of Jersey Post said the stamps, designed by Andrew Robinson, highlighted Jersey's rich heritage.\n\nShe said people in Jersey were probably aware of the dolmen at La Hougue Bie and the gallery grave and cist-in-circle on the lower section of St Andrew's Park.\n\n\"They might be surprised, however, at what can be found a little off the beaten track,\"she said.\n\n\"For example, a short climb through the woodland at Mont Ub\u00e9 or a peek over a low wall in the middle of a field at Grantez in St Ouen will each reveal Neolithic dolmens.\"\n\nDuring her research, Mrs Lowman consulted local expert Jeremy Percival.\n\nMr Percival said there were about 75,000 dolmens worldwide.\n\nHe said:\"Thirteen may currently be seen in various locations around Jersey and more yet may lie awaiting to be discovered and excavated.\"\nTL;DR: Stamps have been issued to celebrate Jersey's archaeological history.\n\nArticle: John SimpsonWorld affairs editor\n\nI have spent a lot of 2015 watching all these developments, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Russia.\n\nThe images of would-be migrants landing exhausted from boats or trudging along dusty roads in the hope of finding refuge and prosperity have tended to dominate our memories of this year.  \n\nYet not every refugee is fleeing persecution.

One I interviewed had been in charge of a boat which sank with the loss of 700 lives earlier in the year.  \n\nNow he faced a long prison sentence.\"If you could see inside my heart,\"he said,\"you'd see the pain and sadness there.\"Maybe he even meant it. \n\nMuch of my year was taken up with events in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the systems left by the Americans and British have been under increasing threat.  \n\nIn May, the capture by IS of the Iraqi city of Ramadi, 60 miles west of Baghdad, was deeply shocking, and demonstrated the savage effectiveness of the IS policy of butchering their prisoners: the Iraqi soldiers just ran for it.  \n\nBaghdad itself still seems completely secure, but nervous. The new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, an impressive and active-minded man, was optimistic when I interviewed him immediately after the fall of Ramadi.  \n\n\"I assure you we'll get it back soon,\"he said.\n\n\"What are we talking about - months?\"\n\n\"No, no, I'm talking about days now.\"\"Days?\"\"Yes.\"\n\nMuch of Ramadi has indeed been recaptured, with significant gains coming in recent days - but it is seven months since it fell.\n\nJihadist differences\n\nIn Afghanistan I watched the advance of the Taliban in Helmand province and elsewhere. Yet I was struck again and again by the differences between the Taliban and IS, which is getting a foothold in Afghanistan.  \n\nThat has brought it into conflict with the Taliban, who have now sent some of their best fighters to combat them.  \n\nA senior Taliban figure, Manam Niazi, told me in September he was confident that Taliban fighters who had gone over to IS would soon return. That hasn't yet happened either. \n\nIn Libya the inability of the two rival governments, one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk, to agree a coalition has also let IS in. There is as yet no sign that IS is taking the country over.  \n\nBut the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011 has opened the door to every form of instability. In July I watched the chaotic proceedings in Tripoli as nine of his followers were sentenced to death and others to long terms of imprisonment.   \n\nStill, Tripoli itself remains quiet, though kidnappings for ransom are on the rise.\n\nPutin dominant\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago I travelled to Moscow for President Putin's annual press conference.  It was a bravura affair lasting four hours, in which journalists could ask him anything, from his policies on Ukraine to how much he earns and who he is dating.   \n\nI asked a question that I hoped might show which way Russia would be heading in 2015. It did.  \n\nWould Mr Putin, I asked, take this opportunity to tell the West that he didn't want a new Cold War? Any Western leader would have used it as a chance to turn on the charm. Not so Vladimir Putin.  \n\n\"Russia,\"he said sternly,\"has indeed contributed to the tension that we're seeing in the world, but only in the sense that it's protecting its national interests more and more robustly\u2026.  It's all about protecting our independence, our sovereignty, and our right to exist.\"\n\nSome of what has happened in 2015 was affected by Mr Putin's obsession with making Russia feel like a superpower again.  \n\nIt became clear that his takeover of Crimea in 2014 is now permanent.  I went back to Crimea in March, and found it was entirely quiet.  \n\nSergey Aksyonov, whose alleged gangland connections didn't prevent Russia from making him Crimea's prime minister, put it bluntly: \"Crimea will never be part of Ukraine. The decision has been made once and for all.\"\n\nPeople there do indeed seem to have accepted the switch from Ukrainian to Russian ownership.    \n\nInternational sanctions over Crimea are making life increasingly hard for ordinary Russians. But in 2015 Russia came back into the mainstream of international politics.  \n\nIn October I saw Vladimir Putin brilliantly take control of a summit in Paris between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.  \n\nIt was supposed to be about Ukraine, but it became a platform for Mr Putin to line up with Western countries in attacking IS in Syria.  \n\nIt was a clever stroke - but will it help to destroy IS? In Iraq, in Syria, in Afghanistan, in Libya, IS has moved ahead this year.   \n\nBut in spite of the chaotic responses there, I suspect that a new and often mutually hostile coalition that includes the West, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia will start to make inroads into IS's achievements in 2016.\nTL;DR: This has been, above all, the year of the migrant. But it has also been the year of so-called Islamic State (IS). And it has marked a major turnaround in President Putin's international position.\n\nArticle: Landlords who fail to maintain their properties will no longer be able to evict tenants who complain, and domestic abusers can be evicted without making the rest of the family homeless.\n\nCommunities Minister Lesley Griffiths said the Renting Homes Bill would make renting\"clearer and easier for all\".\n\nBut some charities fear it will end the six month protection for new tenants. \n\nShelter Cymru and Citizens Advice Cymru have warned it could lead to an increase in early evictions in the private rental sector.\n\nThe changes will mean:\n\nMs Griffiths said:\"Reforming Wales' rented housing sector will make a difference to over one million people in Wales and create a modern and successful rented housing sector.\"\n\nShe will tell AMs about the bill in the Senedd on Tuesday.\nTL;DR: Rogue landlords will be tackled by a new law to make renting a home simpler, the Welsh government has said.\n\nArticle: Second-quarter net profits fell 85% from a year ago, to $190m (\u00a3112m), the company said.\n\nThe carmaker has recalled nearly 29 million vehicles this year, mostly due to faulty ignition switches.\n\nThe cost of recall-related repairs came to $1.2bn, with another $400m put aside for compensation payments. The shares fell 4% in afternoon trade.\n\nHowever, the company said that this was an uncertain estimate.\n\n\"There is no cap on this program, but this charge is the company's best estimate of the amounts that may be paid to claimants,\"GM said in a statement.\n\n\"Due to the unique nature of the program, this estimate contains significant uncertainty and it is possible the total cost could increase by approximately $200m,\"the statement continued.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the ultimate cost of this will be determined by Ken Feinberg [the compensation expert administering the fund],'' GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens said.\n\nThe defective ignition switch has been linked to 13 deaths so far.\n\nGM also said it was changing the way it would estimate future recall expenses, a move which involves putting aside a certain amount of money from the sale price of each vehicle. \n\nAs a result the company has put aside another $900m as a best estimate of\"future possible recalls for up to the next 10 years on 30 million GM vehicles on the road today\".\n\nMr Stevens also said the situation in Ukraine had led to GM cutting production there by 20-25% at its plant in St Petersburg, and that he expects more of the same in the second half.\n\nThose costs aside, GM expects to be profitable in Europe by about 2015.\nTL;DR: Earnings at the carmaker General Motors (GM) have slumped because of costs related to its vehicle recalls.\n\nArticle: Members of the Community union at Clarks in Street voted by 4-1 to take action.\n\nThe union said its members were angry at the imposition of a 3.5% rise linked to changes in pay which it said reduced the value of the rise to 2.6%.\n\nClarks said it firmly believed the settlement was\"fair and reasonable\".\n\n\"We are disappointed that this issue has resulted in Community deciding to work to rule.\n\n\"This award is significantly higher than the best offers made by other members of the British Footwear Association members and is also considerably higher than average pay settlements in 2011 across the UK          \n\n\"Industrial action, or the threat of it, will not change our position,\"the company spokesman said.\n\n'Element of respect'\n\nUnion spokesman, Joe Mann, said the company wanted to impose new terms of employment without negotiation.\n\n\"We would like to put the 3.5% [offer] to the workforce - but the issue isn't about pay its about the company arbitrarily implementing changes to terms and conditions outside of our agreements with them and then roughshod over that relationship.\n\n\"Our members are saying we deserve that element of respect and we want to negotiate these terms and conditions rather than have them implemented.\n\n\"We also balloted for strike action - at this stage they don't want to - but they really want the company to take the message that we're prepared to negotiate and we want an agreement or to go to arbitration,\"he added.\n\nThe shoe company, which is still three quarters owned by the Clark family, was launched in 1825 when James Clark made a pair of slippers out of sheepskin from his brother's tannery.\nTL;DR: More than 200 production staff at Clarks distribution depot in Somerset are starting a work to rule in a row over pay and conditions. \n\n\n\nArticle: The recommendation is one of 200 made in a report by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).\n\nThe report focuses on contingency plans for the event of no deal.\n\nIt comes after Michael Gove said the UK government is\"working on the assumption\"of no deal.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has made Mr Gove responsible for preparing for no-deal.\n\nTreasury sources have said they expect more than \u00a31bn of extra funding to be made available later this week for no-deal planning and preparation.\n\nThe Irish backstop has been key issue in efforts to get a deal for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.  \n\nWhat is the backstop? \n\nThe backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.\n\nRead more here. \n\nA no-deal Brexit would mean the UK leaving the EU and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement in place.\n\nHowever, there have been dire warnings about the potential effects of no deal, particularly on Northern Ireland given its land border with the Republic of Ireland, which is in the EU.\n\nThe CBI has supported a deal, but, in its latest report, it focuses on what steps have been taken by the UK and EU to prepare for no deal.\n\nIt said that the report indicates that neither side is prepared for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and that the EU lags behind the UK in seeking to prevent the worst effects of a no deal.\n\nIn a section of recommendations for UK-EU joint action in the event of no deal, it proposes that both sides must enter into immediate emergency talks on Northern Ireland.\n\n\"The first flight the UK prime minister, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) and president of the European Commission must take, if a no deal occurs, is to Belfast,\"the report said.\n\n\"At the very least, a temporary negotiated settlement for the Irish border is essential to agree within the first weeks of no deal.\"\n\nIt added that parties in Northern Ireland should\"attempt to reach an emergency compromise to restore governance in the region for the period of no-deal talks\"but, if that does not happen, then local politicians\"should be closely involved in agreeing temporary resolutions\". \n\nNorthern Ireland remains without a devolved government after the collapse of the power-sharing institutions in 2017.\nTL;DR: UK, Irish and EU leaders should hold emergency talks in Belfast on temporary resolutions for Northern Ireland if a no-deal Brexit occurs, the UK's biggest business group has said.\n\nArticle: By Michael BuchananSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News\n\nNew claimants, judged to be capable of work with appropriate support, could be given just 50p more per week than people on job seekers allowance.  \n\nCurrent recipients get almost \u00a330 per week more.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions said the ESA proposals were not government policy.  \n\nThe papers reveal that the government has also been forced to hire extra staff to clear the backlog on the benefit.\n\nSome 100 healthcare professionals are being hired to carry out fitness-for-work tests.

for the period between October 2017 and September 2018 - said the inconsistent implementation of rules\"allows a justified view by prisoners that they are sometimes treated unfairly\".\n\nIt also found prisoners with disabilities were\"inadequately catered for\"and the access to illicit drugs and mobile phones\"exacerbates the challenge of dealing with a largely transient prison population\".\n\nIt said violence\"remains an issue and has risen again towards the end of the reporting period\".\n\nMonitoring board chairman Roger Lawrence said:\"The board recognises some areas of improvement since its last report but we remain disappointed that HMP Hewell does still not, in our view, provide a service fit for the 21st Century.\n\n\"The transient nature of much of the population at HMP Hewell presents barriers to meaningful rehabilitation.\"\n\nThe board noted improvements including the installation of the drone netting, the start of a window replacement and refurbishment programme and\"a determination on the part of most staff to make HMP Hewell a safe and secure environment\".\n\nThe category B jail opened in 2008 and holds more than 1,200 inmates.\n\nA Prison Service spokesman said:\"At HMP Hewell we are renovating existing facilities as well as upgrading security netting, cell windows, toilet and showering facilities -

But it has been difficult to speak about it, just because of who Jimmy Savile was,\"she told the documentary.\n\nBut Sir Jimmy's niece Amanda McKenna, of Kirkstall, Leeds, told the Yorkshire Evening Post:\"The documentary-makers should be ashamed of themselves cashing in on a man who is dead and cannot defend himself.\"\n\nAnd his nephew, Roger Foster, from Goole in East Yorkshire, said he was concerned the allegations could damage the reputation of charities Sir Jimmy raised funds for.\n\n\"The guy hasn't been dead for a year yet and they're bringing these stories out,\"he said.\n\n'Care and consideration'\n\n\"It could affect his legacy, his charity work, everything. I'm very sad and disgusted.\"\n\n An ITV spokesman said:\"This documentary is the result of an in-depth investigation into long-standing allegations of serious and widespread sexual misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile. \n\n\"Because of the very serious nature of the claims made by several interviewees in relation to this, particular care and consideration was of course given to the decision to produce and broadcast this programme.\"\n\nFor more than six decades, Sir Jimmy was one of Britain's most established showbusiness figures and a leading charity worker.\n\nThe country's first pop disc jockey, Sir Jimmy was also a seasoned television presenter, marathon runner, Mensa member, wrestler and fund-raiser.\n\nHe was instantly recognisable in his trademark tracksuit and chunky jewellery.\nTL;DR: Sir Jimmy Savile has been accused of sexual abuse against under-age teenage girls in an ITV1 documentary to be shown on Wednesday.\n\nArticle: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo got together to write to the prestigious prize's panel.\n\nThey said they wanted to make a\"collective statement\"at a time when there was\"already so much that divides and isolates people and communities\".\n\nThe judges agreed and revealed the move at Tuesday's ceremony in Margate, Kent.\n\nThe Turner Prize is Britain's most high-profile contemporary art award. The quartet will share the \u00a340,000 prize money.\n\nThe art world had gathered at the town's Dreamland amusement park to find out who had won, but even for an award once known for its shock value, the four-way split was unexpected.\n\nAttendees stood and cheered as Vogue magazine editor Edward Enninful opened the envelope and was surprised to find a statement about all four artists rather than the name of just one.\n\n\"Here's something quite extraordinary,\"he said.\"At a time of political division in Britain and conflict in much of the world, the artists wanted to use the occasion of the Turner Prize to make a strong statement of community and solidarity and have formed themselves into a collective.\"\n\nThis year's nominated works included Murillo's congregation of human effigies staring at a black curtain covering a window overlooking the sea; and\"audio investigator\"Abu Hamdan's sound effects, recreating the noise inside a notorious Syrian prison. They were the pre-ceremony favourites.\n\nShani presented a brightly-coloured feminist fantasy world\"beyond patriarchal limits\"; while Cammock made a film commemorating the role of women at the start of the Northern Irish Troubles in the late 1960s.\n\nIn their letter to the judges, the quartet said they all made art\"about social and political issues and contexts we believe are of great importance and urgency\".\n\nThey continued:\"The politics we deal with differ greatly, and for us it would feel problematic if they were pitted against each other, with the implication that one was more important, significant or more worthy of attention than the others.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Cammock read a joint statement saying their work was\"incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise\".\n\nThey said they wanted to speak out in\"an era marked by the rise of the right and the renewal of fascism in an era of the Conservatives' hostile environment that has paradoxically made each of us and many of our friends and family again increasingly unwelcome in Britain\".\n\nThey added:\"Isolation and exclusion are the weapons of this hostile environment. It is this we seek to stand against by making this symbolic gesture of cohesion.\"\n\nThe jury unanimously agreed to allow them to share the prize.\"We are honoured to be supporting this bold statement of solidarity and collaboration in these divided times,\"they said.\"Their symbolic act reflects the political and social poetics that we admire and value in their work.\"\n\nTate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the judges, said:\"In coming together and presenting themselves as a group, this year's nominated artists certainly gave the jury a lot to think about.\n\n\"But it is very much in the spirit of these artists' work to challenge convention, to resist polarised world views, and to champion other voices. The jury all felt that this made the collective a worthy winner of the Turner Prize.\"\n\n'The upset to end them all', or'virtue signalling'?\n\nReacting to the news of the shared prize, Adrian Searle in The Guardian wrote:\"'Good for them!' - subverting the Turner prize is what artists are meant to do\".\n\n\"Losers have sulked and even attacked people with gladioli. But the four shortlisted artists' decision to share this year's winnings could be the upset to end them all,\"said their writer Adrian Searle.\n\nThe Independent declared:\"The Turner Prize puts itself out of business by allowing the artists to award the prize to themselves.\"\n\n\"The four nominees asked to share this year's prize - but robbing the judges and the public of the opportunity to scrutinise and compare their work hurts the artists too,\"wrote Mark Hudson.\n\n\"Is the baffling Turner Prize 2019 result just a virtue signal for the snowflake era?\"asked Alastair Sooke in The Telegraph.\n\nOn Twitter, Jamie Byng, whose company Canongate published the Booker-winning best-seller Life of Pi, posted:\"What a beautiful and genuine act of solidarity.  I hope this inspires others to think and act similarly.\"\n\nWriter Musa Okwonga agreed, adding the\"only true opponents\"to artists are\"the blank canvas\".\n\nArt critic Andrew Russell was less enthusiastic about all four artists\"asking for a participation trophy!\", as he put it.\n\nNo winners or losers?\n\nAnalysis by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz\n\nThe decision to award the Turner Prize to all four nominees collectively was not made on the spur of the moment. The idea developed in the autumn when the artists first met in Margate for the Turner Prize exhibition opening. \n\nIt was discussed within the Tate (the ultimate overseer of the prize), led by Alex Farquharson. The proposal gave pause for thought, reservations were expressed, followed by the decision to put the artists' proposal to the Turner Prize jury. \n\nThe jury's decision to acquiesce to the artists' request sets a precedent which may well complicate matters for future juries, and possibly, the prize itself. \n\nThe fact is a lot of the artists who accept the invitation to take part in the Turner Prize (some refuse) do so with a nagging concern about its basic conceit: a competition to choose a winner, a best in class. Nominees can see it as a simplistic, reductive notion, which sits uncomfortably. In the past they've held their nose and got on with it. I wonder how many will in the future.\n\nMaybe annual awards like the Turner Prize and the Booker Prize, which also didn't have a single winner this year, are reaching their sell-by date: an anachronism from a bygone binary age of winners and losers.\n\nAlmost 95,000 people have visited an exhibition of the shortlisted works since it opened in September at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The exhibition runs until 12 January.\n\nThree years ago, Turner winner Helen Marten pledged to share the prize money with her fellow nominees - three weeks after doing the same with her winnings from the inaugural Hepworth Prize.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the Booker Prize was split between two winners - Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo - after the judges refused to select a single victor.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It's the dead of night here in London. Where are you and how are you doing?\n\nI'm great, thanks. It's almost 11 in the morning in Vancouver, but I'm working on a film and we're in night shoots - which means you generally start at sundown and go until sun-up. \n\nIt's weird. You said it was pitch black in London and I thought,\"wait, it is here, too\"then I realised my shades are just drawn!\n\nWhat's the film?\n\nThe working title is Besties. It's with Kelly Fremon and [Simpson's producer] James L Brooks. We're about two weeks in.\n\nHow are you finding the balance between film work and pop music?\n\nIt's really kind of crazy because this is my first time physically doing both at the same time. I pinch myself constantly. I get to do what I love and that's really rare.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it's obvious that Pitch Perfect 2 was a segue into your musical career. How hard did you chase that role?\n\nI saw the first movie when it came out and I thought it was the best movie ever made. I remember saying\"if there's ever another movie similar to this, I have to be a part of it\". \n\nAnd then, of course, a couple of  years later there was the sequel. I went to the audition thinking music is really the reason I want to do this. Not necessarily thinking what would come out of it - but, yeah, that was one of the main reasons I wanted to get involved.\n\nIn a very basic sense, acting is pretending to be someone else and singing is baring your soul. How did you handle that transition?\n\nI do find that distinction. Any character I play in a movie, I am masked behind their name and their story. With this music, I'm really able to tell my own story. It's slightly terrifying but, at the same time, incredibly rewarding to know that there are other people in the world who have experienced the same things I have, good or bad.\n\nYou've been asked a lot about the lyrics to Love Myself, and the X-rated interpretation in particular. Your answers are always very diplomatic - you told one interviewer it was about\"taking care of yourself and indulging yourself, whether that be emotionally or physically\". How much did you prepare yourself for those questions?\n\nI am fully aware of the speculations that were being made around the song, so I don't know if [that answer] was completely spontaneous... But there's nothing like actually being asked that question then actually having to answer it!\n\nWhat's your connection to the lyrics?\n\nOverall, the self-empowerment message is really what I was drawn to.\n\nWhen you live in a world that is so full of judgement - and social media takes it to a whole other level - it is so important to realise that self-confidence starts with you. \n\nNo matter who says what to you, about what you look like, or what you sound like, it shouldn't matter - because you're doing what you're doing to make yourself happy. That's not always a message\u2026 I find it very easy to forget that very often. \n\nOne of the other songs on the EP is called You're Such A... What's the word you're leaving out?\n\nOh well, there are a couple! \n\nI had such an incredible time recording that song - it was very hard for me to get through a take without laughing. That song is, for me, the ultimate revenge fantasy, where you can actually say:\"I've moved on. You had your chance and you blew it.\"and mean it. \n\nAt one point you sing,\"You're such a difficult little devil\". That's like the ultimate Downton Abbey insult.\n\nThat's amazing. I haven't seen nearly as much Downton Abbey as I wish I would have. I started watching a couple of years ago when I did a film version of Romeo and Juliet with Julian Fellowes - but I am really bad with being consistent with TV shows. I'll watch a good amount of it, then skip a couple and try and pick it up - but it never works.\n\nBut that's great. I'm going to describe this song now as a reference to Downton Abbey.\n\nNow that you've experienced a career in music and film, which is the most glamorous?\n\nOh wow! They're both pretty gruelling! \n\nAs an actor, after you make the movie, you do the press and walk the red carpet and that right there is what people see as the most glamorous part - the award shows and the whole dressing up aspect which, obviously, I enjoy so much. \n\nIn music, performing is pretty glamorous. I get to wear outfits that generally you wouldn't, or shouldn't - although I now wear them down the street because I love them so much!\n\nBut people forget about the hours that are spent in the studio. You go in at daytime and you come out and it's night time. The same with filming - there's so much that goes into it. I think they're both equally as gruelling and glamorous.\n\nYou joined Taylor Swift for a night on her 1989 tour. Did you look out over the audience and think:\"One day, this will all be mine\"?\n\nOh, I mean, I don't know about that! But of course you go out there and you think:\"This is literal gold, right here, right in front of me. It's Friday night, I could be at home watching a movie, like normally I would be, but this is what's happening right now.\"\n\nI remember thinking:\"I'm going to take everything in, I'm going to remember all of this,\"and then I got off stage and thought:\"What the hell just happened?!\"\n\nBut I'm in constant awe over Taylor and what she does as a person and as an artist. \n\nThey've recently announced that Pitch Perfect will be back for a third instalment. What do you know about that?\n\nUm, I do know that they announced a release date. But that's all I know, and I don't even know the exact date! I don't know what the shooting schedule is, or when it's coming out but I do know it's happening, and I'm really excited to do it again.\n\nWill you continue to juggle acting and singing?\n\nDoing both music and movies has always been part of my plan, and I love them both so much that I don't see myself doing one not the other.\n\nI pinch myself constantly. I get to do what I love and that's really rare.\n\nHailee Steinfeld's debut EP, Haiz, is out now on Republic Records.\nTL;DR: Most people know Hailee Steinfeld as the 14-year-old actress whose precocious turn in The Coen Brothers' True Grit earned her an Oscar nomination.\n\nArticle: Many have been using the hashtag #Quanmianertai# - shorthand for\"Freeing up all aspects to have a second child\"- which has become a top trending topic on Thursday night and Friday on the Weibo microblogging network.\n\nSharing trauma\n\nPeople have been sharing their own stories about how strictly the one-child policy had been enforced over the decades it has been in place.\n\n\"I can still remember when I was little, the family planning department broke down the door in my family home to grab my mum and sterilise her.

Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself.\"\n\nA fall in US growth this year to 1.6%, down from the previous 2.2% forecast, will be offset by increases in countries including Japan, Germany and Russia and India, the IMF said.\n\nEconomists for Brexit, a group of eight influential economists which supported the Leave campaign ahead of the EU referendum, criticised the IMF's forecasts arguing their pre-Brexit forecasts had already been proven wrong.\n\n\"The IMF, together with countless other institutions, forecasted a state of Armageddon which hasn't even come close to materialising in the UK,\"said Graeme Leach, member of Economists for Brexit and chief executive of Macronomics.\n\nHe added:\"The UK economy seems to be strengthening, not weakening. Just today, construction PMI was positive, ahead of many gloomy forecasts. \n\n\"Consumer spending is strong, with retail sales up 6% and car sales also growing.\"\n\nThe group said it still expects the UK to grow 2.6% this year and next, unchanged from its pre-referendum forecast.\n\nPattern of underperformance\n\nThe indifferent economic recovery after the global financial crisis has been a persistent theme in the Fund's regular World Economic Outlook reports. \n\nThe latest report warns of the danger of a pattern of underperformance becoming entrenched. \n\nWeak growth can lead to lower investment, slower productivity growth and the erosion of what the IMF calls\"human capital\"- which means skills and expertise. \n\n'Fraying consensus'\n\nThe UK referendum result highlights wider trends in developed economies, the IMF says. \n\n\"The Brexit vote and the ongoing US presidential election campaign have highlighted a fraying consensus about the benefits of cross-border economic integration,\"the report says.\n\nThe US reference is about the hostility to international trade agreements such as NAFTA, which involves the US, Canada and Mexico,) voiced in the election campaign. \n\nThe Republican candidate Donald Trump has been the most vocal, though not the only voice expressing such views.  \n\nIt is a political trend that has the IMF worried. It argues that an environment hostile to trade would make it harder for commodity exporters and poorer countries to develop new lines of exports. Such a trend would also undermine productivity growth and the spread of knowledge and technology. \n\nMr Obstfeld says:\"It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration. Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy's current doldrums.\"\n\nIn one important area - China - the IMF's concerns have eased somewhat in the short term. Growth has been stable, allaying fears that China's widely reported economic slowdown would be much more abrupt than it has been. \n\nHowever, there is a warning about the country's longer-term prospects and the debt burden faced by many businesses.\n\n\"A still-rising credit-to-GDP ratio and lack of decisive progress in addressing corporate debt and governance concerns in state-owned enterprises raise the risk of a disruptive adjustment,\"the IMF says. \n\nThat could have important international implications especially for commodity and machinery exporters, for which China is a vital market.\nTL;DR: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for UK economic growth next year as it warned that the global recovery remains \"weak and precarious\".\n\nArticle: Its Global Competitiveness Report sees the UK rise one spot to ninth on the list, while Switzerland and Singapore retain first and second place.\n\nThe US improved its competitiveness position for the second consecutive year, climbing two places to third. \n\nBut the WEF warns that the global economy's health is at risk, despite years of monetary stimulus and reforms.\n\nEach year, the WEF, best known for its annual Davos economic meeting, benchmarks countries against 12 factors, including infrastructure, education and training, labour market efficiency, technological readiness and innovation.\n\nThe aim is to produce a comparative picture of what is driving competitiveness, productivity, and prosperity in 144 countries.\n\nThe UK wins plaudits for adopting technology to enhance productivity, and for its general business environment.\n\nFinland (4th) and Germany (5th) both drop one place.\n\nAmong emerging market economies, Saudi Arabia (24th), Turkey (45th), South Africa (56th), Brazil (57th), and India (71st) all fell in the rankings. But China (28th) rose one position.\n\nThe report said that that top-ranked countries had common factors driving competitiveness.\n\n\"The leading economies in the index all possess a track record in developing, accessing and utilising available talent, as well as in making investments that boost innovation. \n\n\"These smart and targeted investments have been possible thanks to a co-ordinated approach based on strong collaboration between the public and private sectors,\"the report said.\n\nRisks\n\nIn Europe, the report warns of a widening split between countries in the South and North.\n\n\"While the divide between a highly competitive North and a lagging South and East persists, a new outlook on the European competitiveness divide, between countries implementing reforms and those that are not, can now also be observed,\"the WEF said.\n\nThe report also sounds a warning that the health of the global economy is at risk, despite years of what the WEF calls\"bold monetary policy\".\n\nIt saw\"uneven implementation of structural reforms across different regions and levels of development as the biggest challenge to sustaining global growth\".\n\nKlaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, added:\"The strained global geopolitical situation, the rise of income inequality, and the potential tightening of the financial conditions could put the still tentative recovery at risk and call for structural reforms to ensure more sustainable and inclusive growth.\"\nTL;DR: The UK has edged up the global rankings in a major annual survey by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nArticle: By Kev GeogheganArts and entertainment reporter, BBC News\n\nConnery played past-his-best boxer Malcolm\"Mountain\"McClintock in the 1957 play Requiem for a Heavyweight, which was broadcast live on the BBC.\n\nDirector Alvin Rakoff recorded the play for posterity and stored it in his attic where it remained for 55 years.\n\n\"He was tall, good-looking and had charisma from the start,\"he said.\n\nConnery\"was an extra\"at the time, said Rakoff.\"One of those guys who rang every other day and asked:'Do you have any work for me?' \n\n\"I did a show called The Condemned, in which he played four of five parts for me - one was an old man who had been in prison for a long time and had gone a bit bonkers. \n\n\"I tried to get one of the other extras to do it and he wasn't quite right and Sean said:'I can have a go at that, Al'.\"\n\n'Ladies will like him'\n\nRequiem for a Heavyweight was written for US television in 1956 by The Twilight Zone creator Rod Serling and starred Jack Palance in the lead role. The play won a Peabody Award. \n\nRakoff said it was his future wife, Doctor Who actress Jacqueline Hill - who he had cast in the BBC adaptation, who convinced him to cast Connery in the Palance role of a boxer who is told that he can no longer fight for health reasons.\n\nHe told BBC News:\"I got a call from his [Palance's] agent who said:'Jack ain't gonna show'. Something better had come up and he didn't want to come to England.\n\n\"She [Jacqueline] said,'Have you seen Sean?... the ladies will like him', which was quite a remarkable statement but it was true, women adored him and so I called him and narrowed it to two fellows and Sean got it.\"\n\nBecause the play was broadcast live and no recording was made, it had been thought the performance was lost until Rakoff, 87, remembered the recording he had made during a recent interview and found it gathering dust in his London home.\n\nSpeaking on his decision more than 50 years ago to make the recording, he said:\"I had suddenly thought:'Maybe this is an important piece,' and I spoke to the man in the sound booth and asked him to do a reel-to-reel so he had an audio recording, and he did.\"\n\nThe British version was screened on 31 March 1957 on the BBC's Sunday Night Theatre anthology and co-starred Till Death Do Us part actor Warren Mitchell and another young actor by the name of Michael Caine.\n\n\"It went out on American television so there were commercial breaks and on the BBC there weren't any and Sean had a big costume change and I rang Rod and said we needed a new scene just to let him change.\n\n\"He said, rather nonchalantly,'I hear you can write Alvin, you write it'. \n\n\"I cast two actors as has-been boxers who were struggling and Michael Caine was one of them. People in rehearsals watched the little scene and said:'That guy's going to go far'.\"\n\n'Scottish-ness'\n\nThe crackly recording of Requiem for a Heavyweight features Connery's unmistakably Scottish burr despite the character being written as an American.\n\nRakoff said:\"We worked hard and long on the accent, he was trying but couldn't get rid of some of the Scottish-ness and in fact Michael Barry, who was the head of drama at the time came to rehearsals and he said:'Are you sure you want to go ahead with this guy, I don't think he can do it'.\n\n\"I said:'Michael I can assure you he can do it'.\"\n\nIn 1962, Connery became a household name when he played James Bond in his first big screen outing Dr No and would go on to become one of the biggest film stars of the 20th Century.\n\nNow in his 80s, Rakoff is still working and has just written the conspiracy thriller The Seven Einsteins.\nTL;DR: A recording of Sean Connery's first-ever lead TV performance, which was thought to have been lost forever, has been unearthed by the film's director.\n\nArticle: Members of the February 20 said they would still hold a planned protest on Sunday calling for greater changes to the country's political system.\n\nThe proposed reforms include giving the prime minister and parliament more executive authority and recognising the minority Berber language.\n\nBut King Mohammed will retain key powers and remains head of the army.\n\nA new article within the constitution also formalised his role as the highest religious authority in the country.\n\nIn a television address on Friday, the king said the measures would entrench democratic institutions and protect rights.\n\nThe proposals will be put to a referendum on 1 July, but many activists have reacted with scepticism, saying Morocco's 400-year-old dynasty has a long history of enacting superficial reforms.\n\n'All celebrating'\n\nThe youth-based February 20 movement, which has carried out weekly pro-democracy marches around the country, said it would continue to call for\"a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy\".\n\n\"The plan as proposed by the king yesterday does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers,\"said a spokesman in Rabat.\n\n\"We will protest peacefully on Sunday against this plan.\"\n\nOthers in Morocco welcomed the king's speech, saying it represented a major advance for the country.\n\n\"The kingdom of Morocco has joined the list of democratic countries,\"said one man out celebrating in Rabat.\n\n\"Today as Moroccan youths, we're all celebrating our new constitution from the city of Tangier to the city of Lagouira.\"\n\nThe proposal to officially recognise Berber - or Amazig - as an official language, alongside Arabic, has also been welcomed. The Berbers were Morocco's first inhabitants and make up some 60% of the population, but have complained of widespread discrimination.\n\nLike many countries across the Middle East and North Africa, Morocco has seen a growing call for major reforms to its political system in the past year.\n\nThe country has also been facing severe economic challenges with high unemployment and rising levels of poverty. \n\nKing Mohammed, 47, acceded to the throne in 1999 following the death of his father, Hassan II, and now heads the Arab world's longest-serving dynasty.\nTL;DR: Pro-democracy activists in Morocco have said constitutional reforms proposed by King Mohammed VI do not go far enough.\n\nArticle: North Norfolk fruit grower Simon Turner said the supply of EU labour had dried up and Covid was still causing issues, while the government's Pick for Britain campaign had also been dropped.\n\n\"We're in a very serious position,\"he said. \n\nThe government said it would continue to help farmers recruit the seasonal workers needed.\n\nMr Turner said he currently had 11 workers but needed 62.\n\n\"We do not know how many workers we will get,\"he said.\n\n\"Before Brexit we were able to employ from Romania and Bulgaria, now we aren't unless they have a right to remain in the UK, therefore that labour source is cut off to us.\"\n\nWith Brexit, the supply of unrestricted migrant labour on farms came to an end and was replaced by the government's Seasonal Workers Pilot. \n\nThe scheme was extended for 2021 to make 30,000 visas available for people who want to come and work on UK farms.\n\nBut the number of visas available does not meet the sector's entire seasonal workforce need.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it still wanted to encourage British workers to pick fruit and vegetables despite scrapping the Pick for Britain scheme.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the vice president of the National Farmers' Union, said it was hoped there would be enough workers through a combination of those from the UK and overseas.\n\nHe said Pick for Britain was born in a\"period of crisis\"last year but\"what we need this year is to make sure we've got that continuity of supply\".\n\nHe said if the crops could not be harvested it would put pressure on the supply chain, which could lead to food price inflation or more imports.\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The technique is also known as Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nWith 100-120 beats per minute Highway to Hell, by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, would also qualify - but its title is not life-affirming, the newspaper notes.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation used Stayin' Alive in a video featuring the footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, demonstrating how to help people who had suffered a heart attack. \n\nIn the US version of the TV comedy hit The Office, a CPR lesson went awry when Stayin' Alive was played and the staff decided to have fun.\nTL;DR: German schools can now play the Bee Gees hit Stayin' Alive without charge to help children learn emergency heart massage.\n\nArticle: Environment Minister John Griffiths said the Welsh government had completed the first part of its badger vaccination programme.\n\nThe trials replaced a controversial cull, which was scrapped in March, and were carried out in parts of west Wales dubbed an intensive action area (IAA).\n\nOptions for vaccinating in other areas are being considered.\n\nThe IAA is primarily located in north Pembrokeshire, but includes small parts of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. \n\nThe Welsh government said last year it was one of the areas with the highest incidence of bovine TB in Europe.\n\nMr Griffiths said:\"Provisional figures indicate that since May we have successfully caught and vaccinated over 1,400 badgers in the IAA.\n\n\"Our vaccination programme has enabled Wales to take quick and decisive action to develop a degree of immunity to TB within the badger population in the IAA.\n\n\"We believe that this should reduce the risk of TB transmission from badgers to cattle and contribute to the eradication of bovine TB over time.\"\n\nThe minister has asked Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales Dr Christianne Glossop to consider other areas for vaccination.\n\nHe added:\"The success of the badger vaccination initiative is dependent on staff being granted access to as much land as possible.\n\n\"I would like to thank farmers and landowners for their ongoing co-operation and encourage other partners and stakeholders to consider how they could work with us to increase the number of badgers we can vaccinate in Wales.\"\n\nThe IAA covers 288 sqkm (110 sqm) and it is thought to be the first time a project to cage and vaccinate badgers has been carried out on this scale.\n\nThe decision to scrap the cull angered political opponents and agricultural unions who say the disease has a devastating impact on cattle farms.\nTL;DR: More than 1,400 badgers have been vaccinated under trials to drive down bovine TB in Wales.\n\nArticle: \"I've done that much crying I can't shed tears any more.\"\n\nThat was 18-year-old Vicky's reaction when she arrived at Save The Family's hostel in Northop, Flintshire, with her eight-month-old son Rhys. \n\nVicky has been homeless since she was 15, when she had to leave her family home after falling out with her mother.\n\n\"I was never angry, I got a bit wild, then depressed and that's when self-harming came into it.\"\n\nShe admitted:\"I've lost count of what number hostel this is.\"\n\nVicky had been referred to Save The Family by her social workers, who were worried about her lifestyle and mental health. \n\nThey felt the charity could provide her with a safe and stable environment, with extra support she could not get at other hostels.\n\nMost residents have been referred by their local council's housing department or social services because of the extra support the hostel gives. \n\nMany turn up with just a bin bag of belongings. \n\nThey were often\"very broken, damaged, hurt, frightened people,\"said 75-year-old Edna Speed, who is in charge. \n\nShe explained Save The Family, which has been running for 30 years, saw itself as an alternative to the care system. \n\n\"We have to look at statistics of care and say,'So it works does it?' \n\n\"It jolly well doesn't. The statistics are frightening and I am rubbing shoulders with the outcomes of care every day. \n\n\"I believe that families are the ultimate, they are the anchor. There is much work to be done on how we keep more families together.\"\n\nSuccess stories\n\nResidents are offered support in all aspects of their lives including housing, debt, relationship and parenting problems, their addictions and how to live with their past. \n\nThe staff are either ex-residents themselves or have gone through similar traumatic experiences which they believe is the key to truly identifying with the residents.\n\n\"You put on your make-up but the scars are still there underneath,\"said 32-year-old Celia.\n\nAfter becoming homeless at 18 she became addicted to prescription drugs. She had four children that were taken away from her and adopted by others which devastated her.\n\nBut she has gone on to have another two children - four-year-old McKenzie and two-year-old Cruz - with her partner Kevin. This time, with the help of Save The Family, she is making a success of motherhood. \n\nShe said the support and lessons in parenting skills and budgeting she received at the village had enabled her to get her life back on track. \n\nShe, Kevin and the boys have recently moved to a terraced house 15 miles away that is also run and supported by the charity. It is the family's first step towards living on their own.\n\nEdna said she was convinced that if Celia had had more\"substantial support in the right atmosphere, that wasn't threatening,\"she would have kept her first four children. \n\n\"I'll never heal but I've got to go on haven't I?,\"said Celia. \n\nShe is working towards the day when she can be reunited with her adopted children, when they are adults.\n\n\"When they come back they will want to see a good person who is doing well, they won't want to see me if I'm a down and out. I'm proving I can be a good mum.\"\n\nRule breakers\n\nThe village, made up of 24 cottages, is funded by grants, charity donations and the benefits that the residents receive. \n\n\"It's not a boot camp but it's not a holiday camp either,\"said Edna. \n\nResidents have to sign a contract to say they will abide by the rules, which includes being up and dressed by 0900 BST. If they break the rules they have straight-talking Edna to answer to. \n\nTensions can rise in the village. During Vicky's stay she said she had been threatened. \n\nHelen Walsh, head of family services at the village, said however they were quick to nip things in the bud but she was not surprised how quickly tensions spilled over into real aggression. \n\n\"I think that's how they are in the community and I think that's how some of them have got themselves in the predicaments they're in. \n\n\"That's why you have to get them together to see if they can resolve the conflict themselves. \n\n\"It means when they go back into the community they know how to handle conflict without it blowing up and escalating.\" \n\nEdna acknowledged her team could not sort out every resident and has been criticised for making the residents too dependent. \n\n\"We've been criticised for being a community but people only become dependent if there isn't an alternative,\"said Edna. \n\n\"If the communities they go back into have not got the community structure, then yes they are dependent because it's going to happen again.\"\n\n\"But we never turn them away if it's ten years, twenty years, two months, two weeks.\"\n\nSave The Family is a Christian charity but it is not compulsory to attend their church services, although most do. \n\nSupport worker Lindsay defended the religious aspect:\"A lot of people would say,'You've got vulnerable families, vulnerable children you shouldn't be encouraging them to believe in god'. \n\n\"Why not? It's the one thing that I know within this place makes a difference.\"\n\nEdna said there was no pressure on residents:\"If we don't pray together we still love you, we're still equal.\"\n\nVicky's stay at the hostel had many ups and downs. She ended her volatile relationship with Rhys's father Mark, who would then not give him back after a visit. \n\nShe started missing curfews and admitted to drinking and taking drugs. Staff urged Vicky to fight for Rhys and she eventually was given visitation rights. \n\n\"I will get him back,\"said Vicky.\n\n\"If Save the Family hadn't taken us in god knows where I'd be now, I'd probably be dead or in a gutter.\"  \n\nHelen Walsh summed up the aim at the village:\"If someone can say they feel safe now and they're not running or their windows haven't been smashed in.\n\n\"Or they haven't seen their mum beaten up and they can sleep on a clean bed for the first time and without being harassed, that is brilliant and that's why we're here.\"\n\nThe charity is due to open its second homeless village in Chester in summer 2011.\n\nFix My Family is on BBC Two on Monday 18 April at 2100 BST or online via iPlayer at the above link.\nTL;DR: Children are at greater risk of being taken in to care when a family is made homeless, a terrifying thought for many struggling parents.

It promises to be a good employer in a\"difficult area of the country to get work\".\n\nNo checks?\n\nSirius says that if shareholders don't accept the offer, there is a good chance the company will go into administration - potentially wiping out their investments.\n\nThe firm says \u00a34bn Woodsmith project, its biggest, could potentially create 4,000 jobs in a region with the highest unemployment rate in England and Wales.\n\nIt mines polyhalite, a mineral used in fertilising crops, from underneath the North York Moors National Park. \n\nThe company has 85,000 individual shareholders. About 10,000 of these are located in areas surrounding the Teesside project, where people may have invested for the regenerative benefits for the North East.\n\nMr Lightowler said that while free access to stock markets is\"utterly fantastic\", he feels that it should be harder for people to put large chunks of their money in very risky investments. like mining stocks.\n\n\"It has to have a set of checks and balances and controls and it seems entirely lacking.\"\n\n'Successful project'\n\nRupert Clewley, a financial consultant in Kent, invested in the company alongside about 30-40 others.

Some \u00a3289m was paid in 2015-16; \u00a373m in 2012-13. \n\nA new\"surcharge\"for non-EU patients accounts for much of the rise, but only about half of debts owed are recovered.\n\nThe Department of Health said the increase showed\"very good progress\".\n\nNHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients. \n\n'Unreliable' data\n\nPeople from the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland, are usually covered by agreements such as the EHIC scheme - where their government is billed for their treatment - while those from outside the EEA are invoiced directly.\n\nBut the National Audit Office report estimated that only half of debts were recovered from patients from outside the EEA and found that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all.\n\nThe Department of Health's\"ambitious\"\u00a3500m recovery target was aimed at reducing NHS trusts' deficits, which reached \u00a32.45bn in 2015-16.\n\nThat year, an extra \u00a3164m was raised from a new \u00a3200-a-year surcharge on visa applications paid by temporary migrants from outside the EEA. \n\nThat year also saw a 53% increase on the amount NHS trusts in England charged directly to patients, mostly to visitors from outside the EEA - much of which is thought to be due to new rules that allow hospitals to charge up to 150% of the cost of treatment, rather than a case of more people being charged. \n\nAnd although amounts charged to people visiting from countries within the EEA increased slightly, they remain\"well below\"the ambition to recover \u00a3200m a year by 2017-18. The latest forecast for EEA income for that period is \u00a372m.\n\n'Good progress'\n\nThe report found some hospitals were better than others at recovering money - 10 NHS trusts in London accounted for half of the total amount charged to non-EEA patients in 2015-16. Twenty trusts said they had no patients using the EHIC scheme.\n\nIt praised the Department of Health for using IT systems to help trusts find patients who should be charged and for visiting 60 trusts to promote its\"cost recovery programme\", and said new financial incentives for reporting and charging overseas visitors had had an effect.\n\nBut it estimated that\"trusts recover around half of the amounts they charge directly to patients, mainly visitors from outside the EEA\", with recovery rates varying widely - and it was not really understood why.\n\nHead of the National Audit Office, Amyas Morse said:\"Hospital trusts remain some way from complying in full with the requirement to charge and recover the cost of treating overseas visitors.\"\n\nHe said much of the increase in amounts charged and recovered over the past two years was due to changes to charging rules:\"If current trends continue and the charging rules remain the same, the department will not achieve its ambition of recovering up to \u00a3500m of overseas visitor income a year by 2017-18.\"\n\nA Department of Health spokeswoman said:\"This government was the first to put in place measures to ensure the NHS isn't abused, and as this report finds, we are making very good progress - the amount of income recovered has already more than trebled in three years to \u00a3289m.\n\n\"We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS to other areas of healthcare.\n\n\"We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover \u00a3500m a year by the middle of this parliament.\"\nTL;DR: The government is expected to fall well short of its target of recovering \u00a3500m a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England.\n\nArticle: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor\n\nThe\"premium\"facilities strip ads from the platform's content and allow it to be downloaded rather than just streamed.\n\nThe music service is priced at the same rate as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal's basic service.\n\nHowever, the wider video content - which supersedes YouTube Red - is available only at an additional cost.\n\nIt includes about 65 series - including several exclusives featuring popular YouTube video-creators - with the promise of a new addition on roughly a weekly basis.\n\nHowever, it costs \u00a311.99 a month for individuals or \u00a317.99 for a family plan, which is significantly more than either Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThis may make it a challenging sell to users attracted by the exclusive video content but who are already satisfied with a rival music-streaming service.\n\nOne company executive, however, suggested that what made the proposition compelling was the fact that videos could be played without ads, offline and/or in the background while apps were in use.\n\n\"I'm trying to say to people that it's not a new music subscription or a new Svod [subscription video-on-demand]. It's really YouTube done better, with those additional things thrown in,\"Luke Hyams, European chief of YouTube Originals, told the BBC.\n\nCanada, Ireland, France, Russia and Germany are among the other countries gaining the services.\n\n'It's all here'\n\nYouTube Music Premium works on Android and iOS phones and tablets, as well as Google's Home smart speakers, but not Amazon's Echo devices.\n\nIn time, the plan is for it to replace the existing Google Play Music app.\n\nYouTube's pitch is that\"it's all here\"- a reference to the fact that it hosts live recordings, remixes, covers and mash-ups that are unavailable elsewhere.\n\nIn addition, the company claims to have a superior search facility to those of its rivals, allowing users to find songs even if they provide muddled-up versions of the lyrics.\n\nHowever, none of this is exclusive to the subscription service, so its appeal will in large part rest on users' desire to be able to listen to the songs without an internet connection.\n\nThe Verge review site described YouTube Music Premium as a\"legitimate challenger\"to Apple and Spotify's offerings, when it was launched in the US last month.\n\nHowever, it noted that the lack of a desktop app and the use of location data to provide recommendations might deter some.\n\nYouTube stars\n\nThe video package - called YouTube Premium -  is based on a library of original content produced for the YouTube Red service over the past two years.\n\nUntil now, it had been limited to the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Mexico.\n\nTwo new shows are being launched to coincide with the wider rollout:\n\nYouTube Premium also contains more traditional content, including a follow-up TV series to the 1980s' Karate Kid films, and a spin-off show to 2008's sci-fi movie Jumper.\n\nBut one expert said YouTube's fastest route to building up an exclusive deep library of content would be to call on its homegrown stars.\n\n\"YouTube already has a great network of people producing material for it, and it won't be short of pitches from them,\"said Hannah Bowler, from the trade magazine Broadcast.\n\n\"If it ramps up its commissioning, it could build up a slate of content quite quickly.\"\n\nThe risk, however, is that many of YouTube's most popular creators end up spending most of their time making content for a section of the service unavailable to most of its users, which in turn could make the wider platform less appealing.\nTL;DR: YouTube is expanding its subscription-based music and video services to the UK and a further 11 countries.\n\nArticle: By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter\n\nEarlier this winter, an experienced mountaineer could barely contain his anger at narrowly avoiding a pile of human excrement on his walk up Coire Ardair in the Highlands.\n\nLater, in a blog, he wrote:\"Right next to the path, not even 10 metres away behind a boulder or tree where it might be discreetly hidden. No, close enough so that you might accidentally tread in it.\"\n\nThe mountaineer said whoever was responsible could easily have gone to a public loo just 20 minutes walk away.\n\nHe even uploaded an image of this toilet along with a photograph of Coire Ardair and its nearby Munro, Creag Meagaidh.\n\n\"This is a toilet,\"he captioned the public loo image.\"This is not a toilet\"he wrote below the photograph of the coire.\n\nBut what should people do if they get caught short in the great outdoors when a WC is not within reach?\n\nIt is a matter organisations such as Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) have tackled.\n\nThey warn that public and animal health is threatened by irresponsible toileting because the waste could contaminate drinking water.\n\nPeople can be put at risk to a cocktail of nasty pathogens, they say, such as cryptosporidium, campylobacter, aeromonas, e.coli O157 and giardia.\n\nA spokeswoman at SNH says:\"If you need to urinate, do so at least 30 metres from open water or rivers and streams. \n\n\"If you need to defecate, do so as far away as possible from buildings, from open water or rivers and streams, and from any farm animals.\"\n\nShe adds:\"Bury faeces in a shallow hole and replace the turf.\"\n\nThe MCofS offers guidance in its leaflet Where to\"Go\"in the Great Outdoors. \n\nIt recommends taking home toilet paper in containers and cleaning hands using gels.\n\nThe council asks that people don't\"go\"near paths, huts, bothies and never in caves. \n\nIt suggests carrying a small trowel to make the task of digging a hole to bury waste easier.\n\nAnd the leaflet adds:\"When digging a hole is absolutely impossible and you are in a very remote place, spread excrement thinly or arrange rocks such that air can circulate. Avoid just putting a rock on top as it slows decomposition.\"\n\nSnow White Facility\n\nFive years ago, the Cairngorms Ranger Service launched the Cairngorm Poo Project following a boom in snow-holing, the digging of cave-like shelters into deep snow where walkers can spend a night or two on a hillside.\n\nRanger Nic Bullivant said snow-holing had traditionally been a life-saving skill learned by mountain guides, rescue teams, walkers and military personnel to protect themselves in bad weather.\n\n\"Now snow-holing has become a more recreational activity,\"he says.\"The Cairngorms has earned a reputation, not quite correctly, as the place in Scotland where the snow is deep enough to do it.\"\n\nHowever, waste being left behind by some in two areas of the Cairngorms raised concerns about possibility of streams flowing into the River Nethy and Loch Avon Basin.\n\nThe Poo Project, since renamed the Snow White Facility, provides walkers with biodegradable bags and plastic containers to keep them in.\n\nComing off the hill, the bags and their contents are dumped down the Poo Chute at the CairnGorm Mountain ski centre car park. The containers go into disinfectant before getting a further wash so they can be reused by others.\n\nCairnGorm Mountain has a licence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to handle waste in this way.\n\nMr Bullivant says the scheme has been a huge success in encouraging responsible\"free range toileting\".\n\nDavid Gibson, of the MCofS, said he was aware of the Coire Ardair complaint but could not recall similar incidents at other locations in recent years.\n\nHe added:\"This doesn't mean that the issue does not exist, but that it isn't reported or perhaps not even spotted.\n\n\"Anything that assists in spreading the word about'where to go' properly helps to encourage and educate good practice.\"\nTL;DR: The \"pristine environment\" of Scotland's wild hills and mountains are occasionally fouled by human waste. Public conveniences are not in great supply on most Munros. What should you do if you need the toilet in the great outdoors?\n\nArticle: Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter\n\nThen he was vice president and the world was reeling from the shock of the financial crisis. And while Mr Biden has defended the economic record of his then-boss President Barack Obama, there are plenty on his team who wish the US had done more.\n\nThis time, Mr Biden's initial economic agenda is Covid. \n\nAs he enters office, the pandemic is still raging, thousands are dying every day, and jobless numbers are going up. Health is wealth, in terms of fully reopening the economy. \n\n'America Rescue Plan'\n\nMr Biden outlined last week what he called his\"America Rescue Plan\"- a $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) effort to fund universal vaccination and more coronavirus testing, and provide funds for households, business and lower levels of government. \n\nMore than half of the figure is earmarked for direct financial relief for families, including $1,400 stimulus cheques for most households, as well as significantly increasing and extending unemployment benefits for millions of jobless Americans. \n\nThe plan also includes raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and childcare funding.\n\nBut this is just a plan - and turning it into reality will mark the first test of the very thin control Mr Biden's party allies hold over Congress.\n\nMr Biden is going to try to win support from Republicans, but they are wary of the price tag. The left of his party, meanwhile, want the stimulus to be even bigger. \n\nIf Mr Biden succeeds, the prize for the economy is a possible growth rate in 2021 not seen since the Reagan era - at 5% or 6%.\n\nThe constraint on his plans is the massive government debt he has inherited, due in part to the economic collapse and the $4tn in stimulus the US has already approved.\n\nBut is it a constraint? \n\n'Act big'\n\nMr Biden's choice as Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said that borrowing rates are likely to stay low for a long time, and as the former head of America's central bank, Ms Yellen has some authority on the issue. \n\nThe US is unlikely to follow the eurozone down the road of negative interest rates, which means finding alternative ways to support the economy.\n\nThe whole administration seems to be behind the mantra that borrowing cheaply to spend is not just possible but opportune, necessary and essential. \n\nAs Ms Yellen put it herself during her confirmation hearing:\"Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big.\"\n\nTo Mr Biden, that means substantial spending on green energy and jobs, as indeed is being argued in almost every country in the world. \n\nThe US government will now be helping to fund the long-term economic transformation spurred by climate change, as embodied by Mr Biden's plan to re-join the Paris accords on climate change as one of his very first acts. \n\nGlobal re-engagement\n\nSo, is Mr Biden decisively turning his back on the steady and targeted erosion of the multilateral system under President Trump? Mostly, yes, but not entirely.\n\nUS antipathy towards China and attempts to contain its rise will continue in the Biden era. \n\nBut the Biden administration will not extend such Trumpian mercantilism to democratic allies.\n\nFor example, the Trump trade agenda systematically dismantled the functioning of the World Trade Organization and viewed the European Union as practicing similarly unfair trade protections. \n\nPresident Biden and team are likely to see the EU as strategic allies, even though eyebrows have been raised about the fast-track investment deal done by the EU with China, just before Biden's inauguration. \n\nThe UK government sees opportunities here, with the G7 meeting in Cornwall, chaired by Boris Johnson, expanded into a D10 of democracies with India, Australia and South Korea. \n\nSome though not all of the attendees are concerned about China's strategic influence over technology, manufacturing, the internet, and global investment and development via its\"Belt and Road\"initiative.\n\nThe other interesting global challenge could be the tech companies themselves. \n\nPresident Trump defended the US giants from efforts to tax them on sales. But Mr Biden might try to address some of the concerns about these global mega-monopolies, particularly as regards to their role in inadvertently cultivating political division and extremism.\n\nThe big picture here though is a president in fiscal rescue mode, and a team haunted by the fear that it fell short in 2009.\n\nThey are determined not to repeat that mistake.\nTL;DR: As was the case 12 years ago, Joe Biden enters the White House on an economic rescue mission after an historic US and global recession.\n\nArticle: Marie Ferguson said she has waited 12 years for an apology. \n\nHer daughter, Raychel, died in June 2001 at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, a day after having her appendix removed in Altnagelvin.\n\nAn inquiry is looking into the death of Raychel and four other children.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr Brian McCord, consultant paediatrician at Altnagelvin told the inquiry he was called into the hospital on 9 June 2001 and oversaw the child's case.\n\nHe said: \"As you have heard, we failed -  Raychel was failed - regardless of any claim for negligence and liability.\n\n\"She was failed in that she walked into hospital but didn't leave in a better condition.\n\n\"Indeed, she left in a much worse much worse... she died.\"\n\nHe told the inquiry that to lose a child was\"totally against the natural order of things\", and added that he had also lost a daughter.\n\nWitness box\n\n\"As a parent to a parent I would like to offer you my heartfelt condolences. I didn't have any chance formally to do that, and I would like to have done it face to face,\"he said.\n\n\"I feel that communication difficulties, particularly on my part, has added to your distress. For example, the false hope that was offered and I professionally offer my apologies for that.\"\n\nResponding, Marie Ferguson said: \"We've always said from day one that Altnagelvin had failed Raychel but for Mr McCord to get up in the witness box and look directly towards myself and my husband and other family members, it meant a lot.\n\n\"I get very angry to hear that it took Raychel to die...  If she had been given the basic care, if nurses had listened that night to what we were telling them about Raychel, and the recording,  documenting input and output, then I believe Raychel would have been here today.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining the fluid levels administered before the children's deaths.\n\nIn the case of four of the children, an inquest stated that hyponatraemia was a factor that contributed to their deaths.\n\nHyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream causing the brain cells to swell with too much water.\nTL;DR: The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died after surgery at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry has said she is grateful a doctor has finally admitted the hospital failed her daughter.\n\nArticle: By Emma Jane KirbyBBC News, Lampedusa\n\nShe's been on European soil for less than two hours, but the capricious little four-year-old from Mali - Lampedusa's newest arrival - has already picked up two vital words of Italian:\"Ciao,\"which she cheerfully chirrups at every hospital patient and porter who passes, and\"Pietro\", which she shouts joyfully and excitedly the way all children do when they see their real-life hero - be he Mickey Mouse or Father Christmas.\n\nFeverish and popping paracetamol pills as he hunches over a mound of case notes on his desk, Dr Pietro Bartolo, 60, doesn't look too heroic this morning. \n\nWith his sore throat and visible aches and shivers, the best place for Dr Pietro today would undoubtedly be his bed, but overnight there were three boatloads of new migrant arrivals and some of them need urgent medical care. \n\nHis office door bangs open and the little Malian girl hurls herself through it and leaps onto his lap, her arms locked around his neck, her cheek against his. She looks over at me proudly. Her Pietro. The Disneyland doctor who met her off that terrible boat with a fluffy white teddy, a chocolate biscuit and a fizzy drink. \n\nDr Pietro roars with delight as she picks up his phone and jotter and starts playing secretary. Her mother, he tells me, is in a wheelchair, but she told him they'd braved the journey to find an aunt who's already settled in Europe. \n\nHe'd asked her gently where auntie was living - Italy, Germany, Holland, France? The mother had shaken her head in confusion. No, Europe, she'd said.  Auntie lives in Europe. \n\nDr Pietro reminds me that EU laws require that the mother is finger-printed and registered here in Italy. She'll never get to her intended destination, will she, he asks. I realise this is not a rhetorical question. He wants me to reassure him. He needs comfort.\n\nWhen the little girl has been sent off to get some shoes, I ask Dr Pietro whether it ever gets easier. He's bewildered.\n\n\"How can it?\", he replies. \"How can you get used to seeing people suffering? You saw that little child just now\u2026\"\n\nHe tells me mostly about the children he sees with agonising chemical and petrol burns - the dinghy disease, he calls it bitterly. But it's the women who suffer the most, he says. They practically all arrive raped, even the little girls of 12 and 13 - the psychological trauma is so big that\u2026 he breaks off and rests his head on the desk for a moment.\n\n\"They all used to arrive pregnant,\"he continues in a controlled, professional tone. \"But no longer - not because they haven't been raped but because, they tell me, the traffickers are giving them injections to stop their ovulation.  We've no idea what dose of drugs they've been given.\"\n\nDr Pietro remains a staunch Catholic - there's a photograph of him on his office wall proudly meeting the Pope - but he's struggling to keep his faith in humanity.   \n\n\"This is man's monstrosity, man's atrocity. We've created this!\", he says. He bangs the desk with his fist suddenly and a yellow plastic toy by his phone quivers on its spring. \n\n\"I know it's difficult to stop wars, to relocate migrants, to integrate them,\"he tells me.\"But the priority has to be to save lives and to stop all this drowning at sea. The talking can come later.\" \n\nI wait until the little toy has stilled itself before I ask him my next question. Because I know why Dr Pietro is so passionate about saving lives - Lampedusa is a small place and Dr Pietro isn't just needed to treat the survivors.  He also has to unzip the body bags.\n\n\"No one can get used to seeing the dead,\"he declares. He speaks flatly and methodically about the process of autopsy, searching for identifying tattoos, dental work or distinguishing marks. Of course, when the corpses are decomposed and it's no longer possible to fingerprint or photograph them, the forensic police, he explains, ask for a tissue sample for the DNA database.  That means - he says - that means\u2026 He puts his hands together as if in prayer, as if asking for forgiveness. \n\n\"I have to cut off a finger or an ear, cut out a rib,\"he says quietly. \"It's so brutal.\"\n\nA quarter of a million migrant encounters over 20 years have not hardened Dr Pietro. He's fighting tears now.\n\n\"I'm not a robot,\"he reminds me.\"I'm just a man with ordinary feelings and emotions.\"\n\nIn the corridor, a little sing-song voice is calling:\"Pietro! Pietro!\"and I watch the doctor of Lampedusa hurriedly recompose himself to become once again the magical doctor of Disneyland.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter\nTL;DR: Every week, hundreds of people seeking asylum in Europe arrive on the Italian island of Lampedusa, many of them sick or injured. The island's chief doctor never misses a single landing - and it's having a huge impact on his own well-being.\n\nArticle: \"The world has lost a gifted author\". The words of Helen Bailey's brother John were repeated by the judge at St Albans Crown Court when he sentenced Ian Stewart to 34 years in prison.\n\nHer skills as a writer had shone through when she started blogging following the death of her husband John Sinfield in 2011, getting to know people from across the country as she chronicled her life as a widow.\n\nHere, some of those people share their memories of her:\n\n'Her words resonated'\n\nLaraine Mason met Ms Bailey online following the death of John Sinfield and Ms Mason's own husband.\n\n\"We were all part of this community of bereaved people, and she was welcomed into it, but it soon became apparent she brought something else to the table - her ability as a writer,\"Ms Mason recalled.\"She put into words what most of us thought but couldn't articulate. It resonated. It was written in a language people could understand.\n\n\"But when I talked to Helen, there was more to our conversations than the commonality of bereavement. At her memorial service, people from the widowed community turned up. This was somebody who touched people on another level.\"\n\n'Lucky to have met her'\n\nBBC Radio 4 presenter Jane Garvey met Ms Bailey in October 2015 while the author was promoting her book.\n\n\"Some people I've interviewed stick in my mind; some don't,\"she said.\"Helen Bailey didn't just stick in my mind, she struck a chord with the audience and generated a huge response when she appeared on Woman's Hour. I'd read her book, When Bad Things Happen In Good Bikinis, and when I met Helen she was exactly the sort of person I'd hoped she would be.\n\n\"I was asked to read an excerpt from one of her books at her memorial service in November, and after talking to her friends and family I realised what a strong partnership she'd had with her husband John Sinfield. \n\n\"Her description in her book of the day he died is a brilliant piece of writing. She deserves to be remembered as more than a murder victim - she was a great writer and an astute businesswoman, as well as being so funny and honest about herself. I feel lucky to have met her.\"\n\nLaura Richards, a domestic violence campaigner and founder of the charity Paladin, a stalking advocacy service, echoed the presenter's view:\n\nMs Bailey was a member of WAY (Widowed and Young), a charity for men and women under the age of 50 whose partners have died.\n\nThe charity posted this message on Facebook following Ian Stewart's conviction for murder:\n\n'Boris saw her through some dark times'\n\nAnother friend of Ms Bailey, Emily Thomas, said she would remember the writer as\"effervescent - full of life, incredibly talented, warm, funny, vivacious. I'll remember her as somebody who took every opportunity to love life despite the tragedy she went though when her husband John died in 2011. She was an incredibly life-affirming person.\n\n\"I think with bereavement, it's not a linear thing, and I think she certainly came out of a period of great darkness into another period of her life with more positivity. But it takes a long time to get over that kind of loss. I think she grasped any opportunity to feel good about life.\n\n\"Boris the Dachshund saw her through some really dark times. She adored him. He was her trusted little companion for a long time, and a dog she had with her husband. He meant a huge amount to her. He was the love of her life.\"\n\nBook sales soar\n\nOnline sales of Helen Bailey's books have jumped considerably in light of the end of the trial, with her first book for adults -\"When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis\"- seeing a 17,000% increase in sales on Amazon in the last 24 hours.\n\nBefore its publication in 2015, Ms Bailey had written more than 20 other books for children and young adults, including the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport series.\n\nIn the weeks before her death, Ms Bailey and Stewart - who had experience as a web designer - were working on a new blog site called\"And Beyond: One Life Live It\".\n\nUnder the headings Fashion, Dogs, Flowers, Food and Life, test posts still appear, with one reading:\"This is just a test post to see how things work on this blog that my super duper man has organised for me.\"\n\nThere are also pictures of her beloved Boris, who is seen next to a copy of her book - the same book which is now climbing the sales charts, introducing new readers to her writing and ensuring her legacy will not be forgotten.\nTL;DR: Helen Bailey - author, widow, fianc\u00e9e, dog owner, football fan - was found dead in July 2016. The man she loved, Ian Stewart, drugged and suffocated her before throwing her body into a cesspit. But those who knew and loved her do not want her to be remembered for how she died.\n\nArticle: Sheikh Hamad's abdication broke the mould of Gulf politics, where rulers traditionally remain on the throne until they die. Sheikh Tamim, 33,  presents a younger face as ruler, at odds with the older generations in neighbouring states. \n\nNevertheless, under Sheikh Tamim's rule Qatar is expected to continue on the path set by his father, with his mother, Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, remaining one of the key driving forces in the country's politics.\n\nTaking over from his father, whose 18-year rule was marked by the emergence of Qatar as an influential player on both the Gulf and world stage, Sheikh Tamim's elevation to emir marks the confirmation of the Al Thani dynasty's grip on power in Qatar. \n\nAl Thani family members hold many key posts in the country's government, and the smooth transition to a new emir underlines a desire for stability in an unpredictable region.\n\nQatar became an influential regional player under the rule of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, backing the Arab Spring revolutions and siding with rebels fighting against authoritarian governments in Syria and Libya.\n\nIt is also home to the Al-Jazeera TV channel and it has won the right to host the 2022 football World Cup.\n\nSports figure\n\nSheikh Tamim was born in Doha in 1980, the fourth son of Sheikh Hamad. He became the Gulf state's heir apparent in 2003 after his older brother Jasim renounced his claim to the throne.\n\nThe young Tamim was sent to Britain for his education at Sherborne School in Dorset. Sherborne's only overseas branch now operates in Doha. \n\nAfter achieving his A-Levels, he followed his father's example by attending the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. \n\nHe graduated in 1998 before being inducted into the Qatari armed forces as a Second Lieutenant. He was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of Qatar's armed forces in 2009.\n\nIt is as a sports administrator that the young sheikh has excelled. In 2006, readers of the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram voted him\"the best sport personality in the Arab world\". That year he chaired the organising committee of the 15th Asian Games in Doha, attended by all member countries for the first time.\n\nA member of the International Olympic Committee, Sheikh Tamim also heads Doha's bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. \n\nAs well as the Fifa World Cup, Qatar will also host the 2014 Fina (International Swimming Federation) Swimming World Championships. In addition, Qatar Sport Investments, established by Sheikh Tamim in 2005, owns big-spending French football club Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nWhich sports most interest the new emir is unclear, but he has been filmed playing badminton, and seen 10-pin bowling with former Egyptian military chief Mohammed Hussein Tantawi.\n\nOther posts held by Sheikh Tamim include chairman of the Supreme Council for the Environment and Natural Reserves, chairman of the Supreme Education Council, and chairman of the board of directors of the Qatar Investment Authority.\n\nIn 2005, Sheikh Tamim married his second cousin Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani. They have four children.\n\nA second marriage in 2009 to Sheikha Anoud bint Mana al-Hajri brought two further children - in total, three sons and three daughters.\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

and it will take time to prepare for those negotiations.\"\n\nBut she added that the EU Referendum had seen a\"very clear message that we should introduce some controls to the movement of individuals from the countries of the European Union into the UK\".\n\n\"I'm clear that the government should deliver and will deliver on that for the British people but we also want to get the right deal on the trade in goods and services and I think this is important economically not just for the United Kingdom but for other countries within the European Union as well.\"\n\nNato obligations\n\nShe also stressed that France and the UK would continue to work together on issues such as counter-terrorism and defence and Britain would\"meet our Nato obligation to spend 2% of our GDP on defence and to keep our promise to spend 0.7% of our national income on aid\".\n\nIt comes after she held talks about Brexit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.\n\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said such encounters were currently at a\"getting to know you\"stage, with EU leaders waiting to see what the UK wants to achieve from the negotiations.\n\nOn Wednesday, at a joint press conference with Mrs Merkel, Mrs May said the UK was in no rush to trigger the two-year process of leaving the EU - telling reporters that although\"this would not please everyone\"it was right to hold off until the UK's\"objectives were clear\".", "prediction": "French President Francois Hollande has called on the UK to trigger Article 50 and start negotiations over its Brexit deal as soon as possible, as the two leaders met in Paris.\n\nArticle: By Nick EardleyBBC News, London\n\nThe UK's data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has launched an investigation into the use of personal data by Facebook.\n\nThe investigation was announced on Friday and is expected to last for two years. \n\nThe ICO says it has concerns about how Facebook uses personal data and how it shares it with third-party developers. \n\nThe inquiry will look at how Facebook collects, stores and uses data, as well as how it complies with the UK's Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nThe ICO is also looking at how Facebook handles requests from users to delete their data.\n\nThe social media company has faced numerous allegations over the past year about its handling of personal data.\n\nIn March, it was revealed that the personal data of 50 million Facebook users had been harvested by the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent.\n\nThe ICO has previously said that it would investigate the use of personal data by Facebook following the scandal.\n\nThe investigation will be led by the ICO's director, Elizabeth Denham, who has stated that the inquiry will be \"comprehensive and rigorous\".\n\nFacebook has said that it will cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\nThe inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into Facebook's handling of personal data.\n\nIn the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is currently investigating Facebook over its handling of personal data, and in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission has launched an investigation into the company.\n\nIn response to the news, Facebook's UK head, Steve Hatch, said that the company was \"pleased\" that the ICO was launching an investigation.\n\n\"We are committed to protecting people's information and will cooperate fully with the ICO's investigation,\"he said.\n\nIn a statement, the ICO said that it would \"not hesitate to take enforcement action\"if it found that Facebook had broken the law.\n\nThe investigation is the latest in a series of high-profile probes into the tech industry's handling of personal data.\n\nIn 2018, the ICO imposed a fine of \u00a344m on British Airways for a data breach.\n\nThe ICO has also launched investigations into other companies, including Uber and Dixons Carphone.\n\nTL;DR: The UK's data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has launched an investigation into the use of personal", "cleaned_prediction": "French President Francois Hollande has called on the UK to trigger Article 50 and start negotiations over its Brexit deal as soon as possible, as the two leaders met in Paris.", "gt": "France's president has said UK Brexit talks should begin soon and that being in the single market meant accepting freedom of movement."}, {"input_prompt": "Your objective is to generate a concise and coherent summary of a given news article.

The female later mated, and Denmark announced last year that it now has a fully-fledged pack. Copenhagen University's wolf programme, which was set up to monitor the pack, believes the first pair moved to Denmark from the forests of eastern Germany.\n\nBut the reasons for the tagging are not purely scientific. Environment Jakob Ellemann-Jensen acknowledged that farmers in Jutland are concerned that the wolves are varying their standard diet of deer with the occasional sheep. \n\n\"The arrival of wolves in Denmark has prompted considerable public concern, and I understand that,\"he said, adding that tagging will help scientists learn more about the wolves and\"hopefully make Danes feel safer,\"the Dagens news site reports.\n\nThis comes after a member of the public was filmed shooting a wolf dead in May, in a case that caused nationwide outrage. \n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nPeter Sunde of Aarhus University told DR that tagging will help scientists spot any signs of rogue behaviour among the wolves. \n\nHe also assured the public that malicious hunters will not be able to use the programme to track the animals down, as details of the wolves' movements will only be made public after a one-month delay. \n\nReporting by Martin Morgan\n\nNext story: South Korean capital gets'first deaf taxi drivers'\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.\nTL;DR: Denmark is to tag its first wild wolf pack in 200 years with GPS trackers, in order to keep tabs on the wolves and protect them from hunters.\n\nArticle: By Amelia ButterlyNewsbeat reporter\n\nWheatley Road in Stanford-Le-Hope, Essex, and Erw Fawr in Henryd, north Wales, both had an average download speed of 0.60 megabits per second.\n\nThat is 30 times slower than the UK national average, according to the comparison site which did the research.\n\nLoundes Road in Unstone, Derbyshire had the fastest speed according to uSwitch.\n\nSpencer Kelly from BBC Click explains why your broadband speeds may be slow\n\nIts research found that 15% of UK residents have access to a broadband connection of 30Mbps or higher, the speed at which the connection is described as\"superfast\"by the EU.\n\nCommunications watchdog Ofcom recently reported that one in four UK residential fixed broadband connections was\"superfast\".\n\nThey say the proportion of superfast connections rose from 5% in November 2011 to 25% in November last year.\n\nAverage superfast connection speeds have also continued to rise, Ofcom said, reaching 47.0Mbps by November 2013, an increase of 47% since May 2010.\n\nTest your broadband speed with BBC iPlayer\n\nAccording to the report from uSwitch, people on the two slowest streets would have to wait more than 15 hours to download an HD-quality film.\n\nMeanwhile, those on Loundes Road, the fastest, could download the same movie in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe research from uSwitch is based on almost 1.9m speed tests run by broadband users on the comparison website over a six-month period.\n\nIn order for a street to qualify for inclusion in the lists above, tests from at least 30 unique IP addresses were required.\n\nIn response to the survey, an Ofcom spokesperson said:\"Ofcom's own research shows growth in superfast broadband and a rise in average speeds which is testament to the investment in the sector. But the benefits are not shared evenly across the UK.\n\n\"There is more work needed to deliver wider availability of broadband and superfast broadband, particularly in rural communities but also in some locations within cities to enable wider access to fast internet.\"\n\nEarlier this year the government announced how \u00a3250m set aside to improve broadband services in remote areas would be spent.\n\nThe money will be divided between local councils and each will have a month to work out how they will spend it to ensure superfast broadband is available to the majority of homes.\n\nThe government has been criticised for how it has handled the rollout so far.\n\nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter\nTL;DR: Two streets, one in Wales and another in Essex, have been found to have the slowest broadband speeds in the UK, according to a new report.\n\nArticle: About two thirds of the 304 speed cameras in the police force's area have already been turned off.\n\nBut from April only mobile speed cameras will be used.\n\nKevin Clinton, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said casualty figures showed cameras worked.\n\nThe move, which involves switching off all fixed cameras in Birmingham, Solihull, the Black Country and Coventry, is expected to save about \u00a31m a year.\n\nIt comes as the long-term future of fixed cameras in the area is considered and follows a 50% reduction nationally in road safety budgets last year.\n\nThe decision was made at a meeting of a committee of the West Midlands Road Safety Partnership Board.\n\nA report to the meeting said it would cost at least \u00a3600,000 to remove the cameras, which would be done over several years. Some inactive cameras will be kept to act as a speeding deterrent to drivers.\n\n'Harming essential services'\n\nIt said an alternative - to upgrade the existing cameras to use higher-grade film - would have cost an additional \u00a3580,000 a year in maintenance costs.\n\nMr Clinton, the head of road safety at RoSPA, said that a reduction in road safety budgets was\"harming essential road safety services\".\n\nHe added:\"All local authorities and police services are under pressure to make cuts and save money but RoSPA believes that cameras should continue to be used where casualty statistics show they are needed.\"\n\nMr Clinton said speed cameras helped to save lives because speeding\"significantly\"increases the risk of an accident happening. \n\nHe added that reducing the number of cameras might also lead to a fall in the numbers of motorists taking speed awareness courses\"that help them to avoid speeding in the future\".\nTL;DR: Plans to switch off all West Midlands fixed speed cameras are an \"unfortunate illustration\" of how budget pressures are jeopardising road safety services, a safety expert said.\n\nArticle: The Commonwealth Games, Ryder Cup and the second Year of Homecoming are all being held in Scotland that year.\n\nThe government wants food and drink producers to use the events to promote their produce around the world.\n\nFunding will support the implementation of the Food and Drink 2014 Action Plan, a partnership with industry groups.\n\nThe government is working with enterprise agencies, Event Scotland and industry body Scotland Food and Drink.\n\n'Best opportunity'\n\nRural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said:\"There will be unprecedented opportunities to showcase the magnificent produce Scotland has to offer.\n\n\"However, it's vital that companies prepare in advance to give themselves the best possible opportunity to reap the rewards on offer.\"\n\nScotland Food and Drink chief executive James Withers said:\"This funding is a pivotal step towards achieving our ambitions for 2014.\n\n\"Our showcasing of Scottish food and drink at the Olympics last month was an insight into what we can achieve. \n\n\"However, the hard work for 2014 starts now, we are developing a programme of work with food and drink businesses of all sizes so they can seize the opportunities over the next two years.\"\nTL;DR: One million pounds of Scottish government money will be used to help promote food and drink firms before a series of showcase events in 2014.\n\nArticle: But he is moving ahead with his controversial proposal to provide firearms training to school employees.\n\nThe president tweeted that there was not much political support for raising the minimum age on weapons sales.\n\nAmericans must be 18 to buy a rifle or shotgun and 21 to buy a handgun from licensed dealers under federal law.\n\nPrivate, unlicensed sales are federally allowed at any age for rifles and shotguns, and 18 for handguns, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nThe White House unveiled its proposals on Sunday night, following an attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February.\n\nThe 19-year-old suspect - who allegedly used a legally purchased semi-automatic rifle to attack Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School - is charged with 17 counts of murder.\n\nWhite House officials described Sunday's plan as a fulfilment of the president's call for action after Parkland.\n\nIt proposes to: \n\nThe White House said a new federal commission on school safety would examine the age limit issue.\n\nMr Trump tweeted on Monday:\"On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting. \n\n\"States are making this decision.

Driving in, she wondered what she was about to face. \n\nThere had been a media blackout at the time and it was months before doctors told us about the patients; that they were relatively well and made a full recovery.\n\nBut this day marked the beginning of the UK's Covid story and, in the coming months, the early trickle turned into a flood of patients. Soon it was as if the infectious diseases unit took over the whole hospital - everyone was in PPE.\n\nITU was rapidly expanded and it has been able to take in Covid patients from not only across the region, but across England. The hospital has since treated more than 2,000 patients.\n\nNewcastle has also been at the centre of research into treatments for Covid, long-Covid and vaccines and, since that night of 31 January 2020, so much more has been learned about managing the virus.\n\nDr Price said:\"One of the things that we did, even before this pandemic, was to imagine what we would do if there was a pandemic.\n\n\"That helped us a little bit at the beginning.\"\n\nOne of the senior nurses now running the Centre for Life vaccination hub, Alison Heathcote, said the ward she normally works on was one of the first Covid wards.\n\n\"It was a really challenging and worrying time for everybody,\"she said.\n\n\"So, to get to this point and to have been involved with something that is hopefully going to have a major impact on moving us out of the pandemic it's really important to me.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

violence\"in jails.\n\nGranting the injunction, Mr Justice Kerr said prison officers' action had created a\"very concerning\"situation. \n\nThe Prison Officers Association said it had achieved its aim of securing a meeting with Justice Secretary Liz Truss within the next 48 hours.\n\nThe union said it was in the process of informing its members about the meeting. \n\nIt is illegal for officers to strike, but the POA had directed its members to stop working after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down.\n\n'I've been attacked with knives'\n\nHow dangerous are our prisons?\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said it welcomed the decision to stop the\"unlawful industrial action\".\n\nA spokesperson said:\"We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and are already taking action to deal with this.\"\n\n'Ramping up'\n\nIn court earlier, Mr Justice Kerr said there was evidence 80% of staff had taken some sort of action in most prisons. \n\n\"A number of incidents have occurred in prisons today and the situation is very concerning indeed,\"he said.\n\nThe POA's lawyer cited a series of incidents he said had occurred in the last two weeks, including 30 assaults by inmates on officers, 14 hostage situations and 13 absconds, attempted escapes or escapes.\n\nBut the government's lawyers accused the POA of\"seeking to take over the control of jails from governors and run them on a controlled lock-down basis\".\n\nDaniel Stilitz QC, for the Ministry of Justice, said the\"danger\"was\"ramping up\"with\"each hour that goes by with the prisons unmanned\".\n\nThe protests affected prisoner transport and brought an unknown number of court cases to a standstill, including that of Thomas Mair, who is accused of murdering MP Jo Cox. \n\nSix prison governors had also been due to give evidence to a Commons justice committee on Tuesday morning but, because of the action, the hearing was postponed. \n\nSpeaking in the Commons earlier, Ms Truss said prison officers did a\"tough and difficult job\", but the POA had failed to respond to government proposals to tackle their concerns.\n\n\"The union's position is unnecessary and unlawful and it will make the situation in our prisons more dangerous,\"she told MPs.\n\nShadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the events were the\"clearest sign yet of... a crisis\"in prisons and the

areas\".\n\nThe union's national chairman, Mike Rolfe, said members did not take the action lightly, but the service was\"in meltdown\"and things had to change\"before any more lives are lost or blood is shed\".\n\nThe Prison Governors Association said it recognised the\"extremely tough conditions\"faced by officers, but it would not condone the action and the\"significant additional risk this places all staff and prisoners under\". \n\nIt said it had held meetings with Ms Truss and was\"convinced that safety and decency was at the top of her agenda\".\n\nRiot\n\nEarlier this month, she

Games.\n\nA pool in Sparkhill has been closed since 2009.\n\nSport England said it was looking for new locations across the country for some of the other London 2012 pools which have been dismantled.\n\nOne opened in Bridlington in January.\n\nInstallation of the Sparkhill pool, to take place at a later date, was part of proposals for a new Sparkhill Pool and Fitness Centre approved by Birmingham City Council's cabinet on Monday.\n\n'No 50m pool'\n\nDeputy leader Ian Ward said its successful bid for one of the pools from 2012 meant it would\"soon have the chance to literally immerse ourselves in the Olympic legacy\".\n\nThe council announced in 2008 it would build a 50m (164ft) Olympic-size pool behind the NIA in Ladywood at a cost of \u00a360m, but in 2009 it said it no longer had the funds.\n\nIn 2010 the authority said a 50m pool had full planning permission and it was\"working very hard to find the finance for that in these difficult times\".\n\nThe same year, Commonwealth gold medallist Adam Ruckwood quit as Birmingham's chief swimming coach in frustration at the lack of a new Olympic-size pool.\n\nParalympian Ellie Simmonds moved from Walsall with her

post-mortem on May's general election performance takes place on Thursday, on what is being officially billed as an internal\"training day\"and before most of the national media have arrived.\n\nThis is perhaps no coincidence, with feelings still running high in the party at its failure to convert its spectacular performance at the ballot box - it won more than four million votes, amounting to 12% of the total vote share - into more seats.\n\nBut while it may only have one representative in the Commons, UKIP has always had other ways of making its influence felt and the forthcoming EU referendum - in which it believes it can play a decisive role - will be uppermost in everyone's minds. \n\nSessions on Friday and Saturday - with titles such as'Europe in crisis','Out of the EU, into the world' and the'Brexit bonus' - will focus on the current difficulties facing the European and the opportunities open to the UK if it votes to leave.\n\nThe unashamed focus on Europe reflects UKIP's belief that David Cameron intends to call an early vote on the issue - possibly in less than a year's time - and the party needs to mobilise itself now.\n\nEuropean fraternity\n\nUKIP knows the party needs to build bridges across parties and with other like-minded groups if it is to persuade the British public to back leaving the EU. \n\nAlthough Nigel Farage has ruled out heading the official\"Out\"campaign, the party was criticised in some quarters for launching its own campaign last month, amid concerns that the anti-EU side was already fragmenting. \n\nIn a response to that, there will be a show of eurosceptic solidarity with representatives from the The Know.EU - which was set up by UKIP donor Arron Banks, and which is being rebranded Leave.eu - Better Off Out and the Freedom Association sharing a stage with senior UKIP politicians. Representatives from the For Britain Campaign will attend the conference.\n\nThere will also be a determined effort to show that the vision of a Europe without the European Union is not confined to the UK. Guest speakers will include Helle Hagenau, a leading player in Norway's'No to EU' group and Joram van Klaveren, an MP for Dutch party Voor Nederland, one of UKIP's allies in the European Parliament.\n\nFarage's authority\n\nAs always at a UKIP conference, Nigel Farage will be the star attraction, his speech scheduled for the prime pre-lunchtime slot on Friday.\n\nHowever, if things had turned out slightly differently, this conference could have been the first of the post-Farage era. \n\nMr Farage's pledge to quit if he failed to win a Westminster seat and his backtracking on this days after he lost in Thanet North - after the party's national executive rejected his resignation - caused the most serious internal ructions in the party for years. \n\nKey figures, such as former economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn, left their posts in the aftermath of the infighting and UKIP leader's long-honed reputation for plain speaking and plain dealing was dealt a serious blow.\n\nWhile he has reasserted his grip over the party, and has the support of key figures, Mr Farage is no longer the most high-profile insurgent in British politics - Jeremy Corbyn has assumed that mantle in recent weeks - and has his work cut out to seize back the political agenda which the party dominated for much of 2014. \n\nElectoral reform - a new cause\n\nEurope and immigration have been UKIP's principal preoccupations for many years but the party now has a new cause - electoral reform. In one sense, this is not a surprise given its meagre return of one seat in May in return for its nearly four million voters.\n\nYet its conversion to the cause is not sour grapes but the culmination of a steady alienation with the current first-past-the-post system.\n\nNigel Farage flirted with backing AV plus in a 2011 referendum on the electoral system and the party's energy on the issue has gone up several notches since Douglas Carswell - the former Conservative MP and champion of political reform and direct democracy - joined the party in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe party is looking to make common cause with other campaigners on the issue, inviting Katie Ghose, the head of the Electoral Reform Society and Eddie Bone, who heads the Campaign for an English Parliament group to speak at the event.\n\nA UK-wide party?\n\nUKIP has become a force to be reckoned with in Westminster by-elections, is increasing its representation at a local level in England and has designs on a host of Labour seats in the north of England where it finished second in May.\n\nBut there is still a long way to go before the party can consider itself a genuinely UK-wide political force.\n\nNext year, it hopes to change all that by winning its first seats in the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales. There is also the small matter of the London mayoral election, with the party's candidate being announced on Saturday.\n\nThe contest pits the party's former deputy chair and most prominent female face Suzanne Evans against culture spokesman Peter Whittle - the party's leading gay politician - and three other candidates.\n\nLondon has not been fertile ground for the party - Lawrence Webb won less than 2% of the vote in the last mayoral contest - and whoever wins knows that they will be the standard bearer for the party in a contest that will have national ramifications. \n\nAll bets are off\n\nUKIP are the only party to hold a party conference at a racecourse and Town Moor provides a striking contrast with the typical seaside and city centre venues favoured by the other parties.\n\nMore than 30,000 people attended the St Leger, Doncaster's most famous race, earlier this month - and while there will be only a fraction of that present this time, UKIP - which has 47,000 members - say the conference will be their biggest to date. \n\nAlthough there will be no equine sport actually taking place, expect plenty of journalistic metaphors about whether UKIP can stay the distance and whether they are in sight of the winning post as the EU referendum looms.\n\nViewing guide to the UKIP conference \n\nFriday 25th September\n\n9.45  -  opening ceremony, followed by speeches on Europe and the migrant crisis\n\n11.30 - speech on\"threat\"from Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership       \n\n12.00 - keynote speech from party leader, Nigel Farage\n\n14.00 - Mark Reckless, former UKIP MP, speech on the economy\n\n16.15 - debate on the EU referendum campaign    \n\nSaturday 26th September\n\n10.00 - electoral reform with speech from UKIP's only MP Douglas Carswell \n\n11.35 - strategy for next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and local councils             \n\n12.45 - tributes to the Queen\n\n14.00 - debate titled\"The Brexit bonus\"\n\n17:45 - closing speech and anthems\n\nYou can follow it all live on BBC Parliament\nTL;DR: UKIP are gathering in Doncaster for their annual conference.

That compares with 49,000 in the same period in 2018.\n\nNasa, which provides Inpe with its active fire data, confirmed recordings from its satellite sensors also indicated 2019 had been the most active year for almost a decade.\n\nHowever, 2019 is not the worst year in recent history. Brazil experienced more fire activity in the 2000s - with 2005 seeing more than 142,000 fires in the first eight months of the year.\n\nForest fires are common in the Amazon during the dry season, which runs from July to October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, such as lightning strikes, but this year most are believed to have been started by farmers and loggers clearing land for crops or grazing.\n\nThere had been a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon, said Douglas Morton, head of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThe timing and location of the fires were more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought, he added.\n\nActivists say the anti-environment rhetoric of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has encouraged such tree-clearing activities since he came into power in January.\n\nIn response to criticism at home and abroad, Mr Bolsonaro announced he was banning setting fires to clear land for 60 days.\n\nThe president has also accepted an offer of four planes to fight the fires from the Chilean government and has deployed 44,000 soldiers to seven states to combat the fires. \n\nHowever, he has refused a G7 offer of $22m (\u00a318m) following a dispute with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe north of Brazil has been badly affected\n\nMost of the worst-affected regions are in the north of the country.\n\nRoraima, Acre, Rond\u00f4nia and Amazonas all saw a large percentage increase in fires when compared with the average across the last four years (2015-2018).\n\nRoraima saw a 141% increase, Acre 138%, Rond\u00f4nia 115% and Amazonas 81%. Mato Grosso do Sul, further south, saw a 114% increase.\n\nAmazonas, the largest state in Brazil, has declared a state of emergency.\n\nDeliberate deforestation?\n\nThe recent increase in the number of fires in the Amazon is directly related to intentional deforestation and not the result of an extremely dry season, according to the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (Ipam).\n\nIpam's director Ane Alencar said fires were often used as a way of clearing land for cattle ranches after deforesting operations. \n\n\"They cut the trees, leave the wood to dry and later put fire to it, so that the ashes can fertilise the soil,\"she told the Mongabay website.\n\nWhile the exact scale of deforestation in the rainforest will only be certain when 2019 figures are published at the end of the year, preliminary data suggests there has been a significant rise already this year.\n\nMonthly data shows the scale of the areas cleared has been creeping up since January, but with a spike in July this year - almost 278% higher than in July 2018, according to Inpe.\n\nInpe tracks suspected deforestation in real-time using satellite data, sending out alerts to flag areas that may have been cleared. \n\nMore than 10,000 alerts were sent out in July alone. \n\nThe record number of fires also coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations, BBC analysis has found.\n\nThe fires are emitting large amounts of smoke and carbon\n\nPlumes of smoke from the fires have spread across the Amazon region and beyond. \n\nAccording to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams), a part of the European Union's Earth observation programme, the smoke has been travelling as far as the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe fires have been releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of 228 megatonnes so far this year, according to Cams, the highest since 2010.\n\nThey are also emitting carbon monoxide - a gas released when wood is burned and does not have much access to oxygen.\n\nMaps from Cams show this carbon monoxide - a pollutant that is toxic at high levels - being carried beyond South America's coastlines.\n\nThe Amazon basin - home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people - is crucial to regulating global warming, with its forests absorbing millions of tonnes of carbon every year. \n\nBut when trees are cut or burned, the carbon they are storing is released into the atmosphere and the rainforest's capacity to absorb carbon is reduced.\n\nThere were more fires in the mid-2000s\n\nWhile the number of fires in Brazil is at its highest level for almost a decade, the data suggests that Brazil - and the wider Amazon region - has experienced more intense burning in the past.\n\nAn analysis of Nasa satellite data this month indicated that the total fire activity in 2019 across the Amazon, not just Brazil, is close to the average when compared with a longer 15 year period.\n\nFigures from Brazil's Inpe, dating back to 1998, also show the country suffered worse periods of fire activity in the 2000s. \n\nReports in mid-August, including on the BBC, had said there were a record number of fires in Brazil this year. Inpe has since made more data easily accessible, showing how far back its records stretched. We have now amended our reports to reflect this information.\n\nInpe's historic figures are backed by numbers from Cams, which show total CO2 equivalent emissions - used to measure of the amount and intensity of fire activity - were also higher in Brazil the mid-2000s.\n\nOther countries have also been affected\n\nA number of other countries in the Amazon basin - an area spanning 7.4m sq km (2.9m sq miles) - have also seen a high number of fires this year.\n\nVenezuela has experienced the second-highest number, with more than 26,000 fires, with Bolivia coming in third, with more than 19,000. This is a rise of 79% on last year. Peru, in fifth place, has seen a rise of 92%.\n\nThe size of the fires in Bolivia is estimated to have doubled since late last week. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles - are affected.\n\nBolivia has hired a Boeing 747\"supertanker\"from the US to drop water, and accepted an offer of aid from G7 leaders. \n\nExtra emergency workers have also been sent to the region, and sanctuaries are being set up for animals escaping the flames.\n\nSouth American countries are planning to meet in the Colombian city of Leticia next week to discuss a co-ordinated response to the fires.\n\nBy Lucy Rodgers, Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Mike Hills and Dominic Bailey.

The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China.\n\nThe situation in Iran is especially worrying, because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran.\n\nIf we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus.\n\nIf countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain.\n\nIreland's chief medical officer has said he anticipates that Monday's meeting of the European Centre of Disease Control to examine the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy, is likely to lead to some changes in advice to European countries.\n\nDr Tony Holohan said the department would respond accordingly and update its advice.\n\nHe said Ireland remained in a containment phase and that as things stood enforced quarantine was not part of the Health Service Executive's plans.\n\nHe said the most likely scenario was that cases would appear in small numbers and hospitals were prepared to deal with that.

The sails are up because they had reached a moment when the crew thought they could break free.\"\n\nShackleton - with the help of his 27-man crew - had planned to cross Antarctica from coast to coast, picking up supplies left by a second team as he neared the other side. \n\n\"He minded very much that he wasn't the first at the South Pole,\"says Hooper. \n\n\"He saw the Endurance expedition as the last great Antarctic achievement.\"\n\nBut he never made mainland Antarctica. After a six-day gale in January 1915, the Norwegian-built ship became trapped in ice in the Weddell Sea. \n\nShe would then drift in the ice for ten months - with Shackleton and his men living on board.\n\nTheir daily lives were recorded by Australian photographer Frank Hurley.\n\nHurley's images show how the crew survived during that uncertain period - when they were at the whim of the shifting pack ice. \n\nThe photograph above shows a football match on the ice. \n\nMeredith Hooper says it was taken in mid-February 1915, after the men had tried to release Endurance for one last time, but then had to accept they were stuck - with the cold and dark Antarctic winter approaching. \n\n\"Shackleton saw the match as a good way to let off steam. They had even flattened the ice to create a pitch.\"\n\nEndurance's role changed from that of a ship to that of a shore station. Many of the crew were assigned new sleeping quarters in the hold - mockingly they called it The Ritz. \n\nThe tradition of scrubbing the floor remained, and everyone - except perhaps Shackleton himself - took their turn. \n\nIn this photo we see Jock Wordie the expedition geologist on the left - with Third Officer Alfred Cheetham in the centre - and Alexander Macklin the ship's doctor on the right.\n\nPhotographer Frank Hurley has placed himself in this picture - which shows him playing chess to fill the long dark winter days of mid-1915. \n\n\"We know this was taken before May 1915,\"says Meredith Hooper. \n\n\"Because in May they all had a fit of madness and decided to shave their heads. And in this photo, Hurley, on the left, still has his hair.\"\n\nHurley's hair is growing back in the next photo, which was taken in his cabin. Macklin the doctor is on the right.\n\nFor the first time, Hurley's images have been scanned digitally direct from the original glass plates on which they were taken - revealing details never seen before. The mid-ground and background in each shot is crisper and sharper. \n\n\"You can see the Australian flag, a penguin picture and a boomerang,\"says Hooper. \n\n\"But I particularly like the Carsons chocolates by Hurley's bed. On Saturday nights the crew would toast sweethearts and wives - and for those who didn't want alcohol, like Hurley, Shackleton had provided chocolates.\"\n\nBack in\"The Ritz\", this photo shows the midwinter dinner to celebrate the shortest day of the year - 22 June 1915. \n\nThe cabin is adorned with the UK, Australian and New Zealand flags.\n\n\"They had peas,\"says Hooper.\"But no one had yet started eating. Knives and forks are poised.\"\n\n\"On the left is Perce Blackborow, a stowaway who was given the job of steward.\"\n\nThe same space is transformed for this posed image which shows what Endurance's crew did on a typical day. Scientific experiments, typing and reading. \n\nThe steward, Blackborow, is again in shot on the left. He is carrying a large block of ice to be turned into drinking water. \n\nHere, a group of men are gathered around the ship's stove during the night watch. \n\n\"There would normally be only one or two men on the night watch,\"says Hooper.\"But people on that shift got extra food, and so your mates would suddenly appear.\n\n\"Hurley is expressing intimacy and comradeship.\"\n\nLooking at the next two images, Hooper says they were both taken on the same day - possibly 1 September 1915. \n\nFirst, Hurley is shown taking a photo with his heavy equipment - under the prow of Endurance and standing on big chunks of crumbling ice. \n\nAnd then there is an image of the rest of the crew.\n\n\"Personally I think the group shot was taken as a morale booster,\"says Hooper.\"You can see the light is back, spring is coming, and all the men are dressed in new kit. It's very much a posed photo.\"\n\nDogs were on board ship with the crew. Shackleton had planned to cross Antarctica with them. \n\nBut in time, as feeding the animals becoming an issue, the dogs had to be put down. \n\n\"They found it very difficult,\"says Hooper.\n\nEndurance was subjected to huge pressure from the ice - and there were moments when she listed, but then righted herself. \n\nBut by the end of October 1915, with water leaking in, the crew took the decision to decamp on to the ice.\n\n\"They described a terrifying experience,\"says Hooper. \n\n\"They had to move their tents twice in one night, with the ice cracking and squealing. And then there was the sound of the ship suffering - it was crying like a wounded animal.\"\n\nEndurance sank on 21 November 1915.\n\nHere, outside their tent on the ice, Hurley on the left and Shackleton on the right.\n\nHurley is cutting fine strips of seal blubber - fuel for the portable stove which sits between them, and which he invented. \n\n\"It was also endlessly wet,\"says Hooper.\"And when the right day came - with some wind and some sunshine - they tried to dry all their stuff.\"\n\nHurley was forced to become more selective with his subject matter as time went on - and in the end he destroyed 400 of his negatives, keeping only 120, of which the Royal Geographical Society now looks after 68.\n\nBy April 1916, in three small boats which had been taken off Endurance, Shackleton and his crew left the floating ice and started an arduous voyage to uninhabited Elephant Island. \n\nIt took them seven long days - but miraculously, everyone survived. \n\nThen - in one boat from Elephant Island - Shackleton took five of his crew on a 750-mile journey to South Georgia, where there were whaling stations. Finally he managed to raise the alarm.\n\nThis last image shows the Yelcho - a Chilean steamer - returning to pick up the remaining 22 men from Elephant Island at the end of August 1916. \n\n\"The story ended successfully but at any point - almost daily - it could have ended in disaster,\"says Hooper. \n\n\"The story which had to be told was the success of survival - and Frank Hurley's images are terribly important in that narrative.\"\n\nEnduring Eye: The Antarctic Legacy of Sir Ernest Shackleton and Frank Hurley can be seen at the Royal Geographical Society in London from 21 November 2015 until 28 February 2016.\n\nAll images subject to copyright.\nTL;DR: A century ago a ship sank beneath the ice of the Weddell Sea off Antarctica.

It obliges the biggest social networks - those with more than two million German users - to take down\"blatantly illegal\"hate speech within 24 hours of it being reported. For material that's less obviously violating the law, networks such as Facebook and Instagram will have seven days to consider and, if appropriate, delete posts. Failure to meet these deadlines could lead to fines of up to \u20ac50m.\n\nCritics argue the short timeframes coupled with the potentially large fines will lead social networks to be overly cautious and delete huge amounts of content - even things that are perfectly legal. But the law's supporters, and the German government, argue that it will force social media companies to proactively deal with online incitement and hate speech.\n\nWhat counts as'illegal hate speech' in Germany?\n\nThe law doesn't actually change what's considered hate speech in Germany. No new offences are created. The law simply cites sections of the German Criminal Code which details illegal speech online. The categories range from\"forming terrorist organisations\", to the much vaguer\"defamation of religions, religious and ideological associations.\"\n\nIn addition, German law restricts some types of speech that are allowed in many other countries. For instance, the use of Nazi symbols is banned, as are the symbols and flags of some extremist groups.  \n\nAn earlier draft of the NetzDG bill barred\"defamation of the President of the Federation\", but the clause was removed after criticism. The law has also been criticised for containing no legal mechanism for people whose posts are wrongly deleted to appeal to get them reinstated.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nSo who is worried?\n\nOpposition has come from a wide range of groups and politicians on both the left and right - and Facebook has also made its disagreement with the law clear. \n\nThe United Nations has also weighed in. David Kaye, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, has written to the German government to warn about the potential consequences of the law.\n\n\"With these 24 hour and seven day deadlines - if you are a company you are going to want avoid fines and bad public branding of your platform,\"he says.\"If there is a complaint about a post you are just going to take it down. What is in it for you to leave it up? I think the result is likely to be greater censorship.\"\n\nThe group Reporters without Borders says the German law has already inspired a\"draconian\"new online media law in Russia. \n\nBut there are voices in Germany who are in favour of the law and who argue that making social networks more responsible for hate speech and illegal content on their platforms is a good thing. \n\nAnas Modamani is a refugee from Syria who now lives in Berlin. In August 2015 he was catapulted to notoriety for taking a selfie with Angela Merkel while she was visiting a migrant shelter.\n\nBut the picture would come back to haunt him, as it was used to accuse him of attacks in Brussels and Berlin. His famous photograph was cropped and pasted into wanted posters and false news reports.\n\n\"When I read the fake news on the internet, I really cried, it was really bad in my life, it was all untrue,\"Modamani says. \n\nHe decided to take Facebook to court for not doing enough to stop the lies being shared about him, but in March 2017 he lost the case. The court ruled Facebook had taken enough measures to attempt to block defamatory images of him for users in Germany. \n\nBecause of his experiences, Modamani is a supporter of NetzDG. \n\n\"I think the law is a good idea because people will be a little bit afraid, they can't just write what they want,\"he says.\"I don't mind if other comments get deleted along with the bad ones.\"\n\nModamani's lawyer, Chan-Jo Jun, is also optimistic about the new law, and plans to use it immediately after it comes into effect. \n\n\"I regularly report the post that was the subject of the [earlier] trial and I keep getting the answer [from Facebook] that it does not violate community standards,\"Jun says.\"Therefore it is still online. After October I will file a complaint against Facebook under the NetzDG - with the NetzDG, the court case would not have been necessary.\"\n\nOn the other side of the legal debate is attorney Joachim Steinhoefel. While Chan-Jo Jun has taken Facebook to court to get them to remove posts, Steinhoefel has threatened the company with legal action to get a post reinstated.\n\nIn May, photojournalist Markus Hibbeler wrote a Facebook post about Islam and freedom of expression. Translated from German, the post read in part:\"We shouldn't shield Muslims, and certainly not Islam, which has never been through an enlightenment or reformation, from criticism and constantly protect them.\"\n\nHis post was deleted by Facebook and his account was suspended for seven days. Hibbeler, with Steinhoefel's help, threatened to sue Facebook if the post wasn't put back up within a week and his account reinstated. They succeeded, and Facebook reinstated the post and apologised. \n\nIt's cases like Hibbeler's, Steinhoefel says, that show how NetzDG threatens freedom of expression. He says he doesn't trust Facebook to decide what posts are legal and illegal and thinks the most likely outcome will be a mass deletion of legal posts that Facebook doesn't want to take any risks with, out of an abundance of caution. \n\nThe attorney has started a blog where he posts examples of Facebook deleting posts which he says break no laws. The blog also catalogues what Steinhoefel says are blatantly illegal posts which Facebook hasn't removed. \n\nFor example, one of the latter posts reads:\"Jews to the gas chambers\". Facebook has not removed it, despite it being reported to the company. \n\n\"It goes to show how unprofessional they are in dealing with this content,\"Steinhoefel says. He is suspicious of the real motive behind the new law and says it will allow\"the media and political elite to regain control over the political debate in Germany.\"\n\n\"The law is superfluous,\"he says.\"The law as it is right now in Germany makes Facebook responsible for illegal content on its site from the moment they know about it. It just takes state prosecutors and courts to implement these laws.\"\n\nThe German government, however, is determined to press forward with NetzDG. Gerd Billen, a State Secretary in the German Ministry of Justice, says that although existing laws oblige Facebook to delete illegal comments\"there are no rules about when they have to do it, how they have to organise and what their complaint management system should look like.\"\n\n\"There is a fear of'over-blocking' but the reality is'under-blocking',\"Billen says.\"They don't block enough. We don't believe there will be a problem (with over-blocking) because the social networks want to keep their customers.\"\n\nAlso from Trending:\n\nBillen downplays concerns about freedom of speech, and points out that social media companies already censor content that is perfectly legal.\n\n\"There is no obligation for any private company in Germany or somewhere else in the world to guarantee freedom of speech,\"he says.\"To guarantee freedom of speech is something a government does but not private companies. I didn't find any notice in the terms and conditions of Facebook that the company will respect freedom of speech. \n\n\"For example they delete many things that are allowed in Germany. Facebook don't accept naked people on their platform. They can decide if they don't want it, so they delete it.\"\n\nOpposition from social media companies \n\nA Facebook spokesperson admitted to the BBC that they can't rule out the possibility of legal content being deleted. \n\n\"The law is not the right way to fight hate speech online,\"the spokesperson says.\"It provides an incentive to delete content that is not clearly illegal and would have the effect of transferring responsibility for complex legal decisions from public authorities to private companies.\n\n\"Several legal experts have assessed the draft law as being against the German constitution and non-compliant with EU law. Facebook is committed to working in partnership with governments and civil society on solutions that would have made this law unnecessary.\"\n\nThe BBC also learnt that although the company will soon have another 500 content moderators based in Essen, in western Germany, Facebook has not hired any new staff in response to the law.\n\n\"We are still evaluating what the law really means for us,\"the spokesperson says.\n\nYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.  All our stories are at bbc.com/trending.\nTL;DR: In October a new law comes into force in Germany that will impose huge fines on social networks if they don't delete illegal content including hate speech.

And that shouldn't be because people\"need to be seen\"by sending everyone an email on Saturday afternoons.\n\nHe says the difficulty with dealing with parents' emails is that it can be such an open-ended dialogue.\n\nHow do you go about answering emails about\"who got the parts in the Christmas play\"? It's about diplomacy as well as directness and emails run the risk of being interpreted differently from how they were intended.\n\nCarl Ward, head of the City Learning Trust, in Stoke-on-Trent, says schools need to make sure that staff are not under any pressure to answer emails out of working hours.\n\nHe says that it can also be a good idea not to give out individual staff emails and to filter requests through a central point of contact.\n\nIt's also not just a problem for teachers in the UK.\n\nLotta Juvin, a school principal from Malmo, in Sweden, says fears of a work overload is damaging the recruitment of teachers in her country.\n\n\"Parents think they know everything,\"and they are not shy of sending in their suggestions and expecting replies, she says.\n\n\"Why didn't my child get all As?\"she says, describing the questions in the email in-tray.\n\nSchools are now expected to act as welfare centres and social workers, she says, adding to the type of out-of-hours requests likely to arrive.\n\nAs a school leader, she says, she has to lead by example by not sending out unnecessary emails.\"You can say,'No,'\"she says.\n\nMeanwhile, one other teacher at the educational technology show says there is also another category of irritating email sent to all staff:\"I've lost my cup.

Between 1998 and 2011-12, the number of children in relative poverty in the UK fell by about one million.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government's aim was to get children out of poverty by getting more people in to work.\n\n\"While this government is committed to eradicating child poverty, we want to take a new approach by finding the source of the problem and tackling that.  We have successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and seen a reduction of 100,000 children in workless poor families,\"he said.  \n\n\"Today's figures underline the need for better measures of child poverty that are not so heavily dependent on where we draw the poverty line.\" \n\nBut children's campaigners say the true picture is worse than the government figures suggest and that the children moving in to the poverty bracket are in families where people are working.\n\nMatthew Reed, the chief executive of the Children's Society, said the statistics painted\"a depressing picture\".\n\n\"There are now 2.4 million children in working households living in absolute poverty - an unacceptable truth about life in Britain today,\"he said. \n\n\"Latest figures also reveal that in the first full year of the coalition government, 300,000 more children faced a real fall in living standards that pushed them into absolute poverty. The entire increase is from homes where parents are working.\"\n\nLiam Byrne MP, Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: \"The devastating verdict is in - in just one year this government

suggests that the age group has seen a faster adoption rate than any other over the past five years.\n\nBut it also highlighted that members of the demographic tended to use their smartphones less than younger people.\n\nFor instance, about 20% said they checked their phones within 15 minutes of waking compared with a national average of 56%.\n\nAnd about 50% had Facebook installed compared to a 70% figure for all adults.\n\nThe study was based on a sample of 1,163 people questioned between May and June this year.\n\nDeloitte suggested that the 55-to-75-year-old group's higher than average wealth might make members more likely to buy premium handsets, although some will have inevitably started using a smartphone as a consequence of being given a hand-me-down from their children.\n\nIts research team also acknowledged that some first-time buyers might have felt forced into making the purchase.\n\n\"A growing number of parking meters may encourage payment via mobile phone, for example with a smartphone app offering the greatest convenience,\"they said in a company report.\n\n\"It may [also] become increasingly difficult to order a taxi in cities without using an app.\"\n\nOne

She recalled him humming a tune repeatedly and asked him what it was.\"He only had part of the chorus at the time, Last Christmas I gave you my heart. It became a Christmas classic. I am so sad that he is gone and that this was his last Christmas.\"\n\n'Special passenger'\n\nVicki Hassett Gray from the UK, worked as a purser for British Airways in the 1980s and 1990s. On one of her flights from Los Angeles to London, a special passenger was on board. It was George Michael, described by Vicki as\"gracious, polite and friendly\".\n\n\"When he had boarded I had taken a large hanging wardrobe off him and forgot to give it back to him when we arrived at London. All the passengers had disembarked and I was getting ready to leave when George Michael appeared in the cabin and I cheekily asked him:'Have you come to say goodbye to me properly George?' I got a kiss and a hug and he wasn't a bit cross that I'd forgotten his bag.\"\n\n'My escape'\n\nFor Adina Sadeanu, from Romania, George Michael's songs acted as a rescue and means of escape during difficult times. She wrote:\"It was in 1990, one year after the Romanian Revolution. I was 17 and I had to go for a surgery that kept me in the hospital for weeks.\n\n\"One of my very few joys was listening to George Michael and Roxette. I listened to Freedom and Careless Whisper over and over. I never got tired of his music. He gave me joy. He made me dream. He was my escape to another universe, far away from the pain and sorrow that surrounded me.\"\n\nPosters defiance\n\nFer Kaka, from Johannesburg, (pictured below) wrote:\"Growing up in a strict religious family, we weren't allowed to have posters on our wall. However, as a 10-year-old girl, I'd save up all my money to buy George Michael posters and my very first cassette. I hung his posters up in my bedroom defying all odds.\"\n\nTranslation conundrum\n\nTatiana Namy\u015blak grew up in Poland and English was not her first language. She wrote:\"I still remember the embarrassed look on my tutor's face when I asked her to translate Love Machine for me. It wasn't easy for her to understand the music.\n\n\"I still have these albums which I'd always asked my dad to buy for me. They were unavailable in Poland, and I could always count on him to bring the new releases for me as was he a seaman.\"\n\n'Gentle whisper'\n\nCharlize Snoox had known George Michael since the 1980s. She said he was reasonably insecure about his looks.\"George only loved one side of his face and in social gatherings he always used to sit with his'good side' to us,\"she recalls.\n\nShe remembers him as being extremely gentle.\"Whenever George says goodbye to me, he never shook hands. He would always take my face in his hands and gently whisper in my ear'take care' and then give me a kiss on the cheek.\"\n\nWedding dance\n\nCyndi Nahas, from the US, said George Michael's songs remind her of many events in her life.\n\n\"When I was six years old my very first cassette was Wham! Make It Big. It is still in my old cassette player unmoved. I remember singing Faith with my friends on the swing sets in elementary school, falling asleep to Praying for Time in high school, walking to class in college to Fastlove, and dancing my first dance with my husband at my wedding a year-and-a-half ago to GM's creamy voice covering Stevie Wonder's You and I.\"\n\nWalk and talk\n\nSarah Broad from the UK, recalled meeting George Michael in London. She wrote:\"I met George just a corner away from Harrods, a week before Christmas 1986. He obligingly signed autographs for a handful of people, me included. Once finished, he was walking my way, behind me, so I asked if we could walk together. He agreed and we chatted for about 5-10 minutes until we reached his property.  He wished me a Merry Christmas and beamed that beautiful smile!\"\n\n'Symbol of freedom'\n\nFor Theophilus Ghoststone, from Ohio, George Michael was a symbol of progression and freedom. He wrote:\"When the video Wake Me Up Before You Go Go came out, I was mesmerized by George and his gold earrings. I loved his style, his talent and his beautiful voice. I never met the man, but he changed my life for the better and hope he has found peace.\"\n\n Produced by Faisal Irshaid, UGC & Social news team\nTL;DR: Millions of fans around the world have been left devastated by the death of pop superstar George Michael.

No-one is forcing you to do anything.\"\n\nThis distinction between letting someone else take care of the beat or the melody - and letting someone else write your rhymes - is one that's crucial.\n\nUsing a ghostwriter is basically a sin in the rap world - but it's something Drake, Jay-Z and Kanye West have all been accused of.\n\nIn the case of Drake, he found the suggestion so offensive it started a three-year feud with the man who accused him, fellow rapper Meek Mill.\n\nIn a studio down the hall we meet British rapper Ms Banks.\"For sure ghostwriting happens,\"she tells us.\n\n\"So many rappers work with writers and it's such a blurred line now with people doing the melodic stuff as well.\n\n\"It's just such a natural thing for people to ask you, as you're getting bigger, if you want to get in with a writer.

Those particles can carry electrical charges, while frictional collisions between grains can also build up charge. \n\nIf the positively-charged ash particles become separated from the negatively-charged particles in sufficient quantity, and the two oppositely charged regions become temporarily linked, this is a lightning bolt. A similar process occurs in thunderclouds. \n\nIt is thought in volcanic lightning the charges could be carried by ions - charged individual atoms - rather than specks of ash. \n\nIs the ash a hazard to one's health? - Robert Aguiniga\n\nVolcanic ash poses a number of health hazards. \n\nIt is a nasal and respiratory irritant, and so people need to avoid inhaling it - which means if you are below an ash fall, stay indoors or wear a mask. Going outdoors after ashfall, avoid kicking it up which would reactivate the original hazard. You wouldn't want it in your eyes either, as the particles are sharp. \n\nAsh can carry poisons such as fluorine, and sheep in Iceland have died from eating grass tainted by ash from local eruptions, but this does not affect people directly.\n\nOther problems that ashfall can cause include: stripping leaves from vegetation, building up on roofs until they collapse, and turning into devastating mudflows, called lahars, when the first heavy rainfall occurs.\n\nSo far in the current Taal eruption, the eruption column has not exceeded more than about 1km (3,281ft) high, so the ash has not travelled very far.\n\nWill the ash and gas from Taal reach the stratosphere? - Mike Rhode\n\nTo reach the stratosphere, an eruption column from Taal volcano would need to reach about 15km or more in height, which is the approximate base of the stratosphere at Taal's latitude, only 14 degrees north of the equator. \n\nThis may have happened in its 1754 and 1965 eruptions, so it could happen again. \n\nWhat are the chances of full eruption? - Daniel Reaney\n\nI guess by\"full eruption\"you mean something like the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo, which lies about as far to the north-west of Manila as Taal is to the south. That measured six on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) scale when the eruption column reached a height of 24km. \n\nThe last time Taal had an eruption on that sort of scale was about 5,500 years ago, whereas it had VEI-4 eruptions in 1716, 1749, 1754 and 1965. \n\nSo far, Taal's current eruption is much smaller. The authorities have wisely declared a 15km radius evacuation zone, and Manila airport has been closed at times for fear of airborne ash affecting jet engines.\n\nTaal could ramp up to something really big, but it is more likely to continue as it is for a while before quietening down again.\n\nCan eruption of one volcano lead to the eruption of others in this or nearby countries? - Harish Kumar\n\nThere is no known mechanism for an eruption at one volcano to set off an eruption at another volcano. Their magma plumbing systems are not directly connected, despite adjacent volcanoes being fed from the same source. The same really powerful earthquake might trigger two very close volcanoes, but that is about it.\n\nTaal volcano, like the other volcanoes in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia, are a consequence of plate tectonics. An oceanic plate is being pushed (subducted) below an island arc. Melting begins at a depth of about 70km, and the magma, which is the molten rock below the earth's crust, rises up to feed volcanoes.  \n\nThis is a slow process, with magma taking thousands of years (or longer) to migrate to the surface. A particular volcano will not erupt until there is enough magma and associated gas collected in its shallow magma chamber. Sometimes an earthquake can prematurely set off an eruption that might not have happened for a few more years.\n\nWill the eruption, if this volcano erupts, affect the fires in Australia? - Katherine Gonzalez\n\nIf Taal was to have a really big eruption producing a large ash cloud, I do not think it would have any impact on the fires in Australia.  An ash cloud from Taal would be unlikely to spread far into the southern hemisphere, even if high-altitude winds were to spread it right round the globe.\n\nThat is a shame in this case, because fine ash in the air can lead to extra rainfall, which presumably would be welcome in south-eastern Australia because of the bushfires.\nTL;DR: Lava has started to emerge from the Taal volcano in the Philippines, as the nation prepares for a \"hazardous eruption\".\n\nArticle: About 540 staff at Maltby Colliery, near Rotherham, have been told of the decision by owner Hargreaves Services.\n\nLast month unusually high levels of water, oil and gas were found at the site and the owners warned about the possible closure of the site.\n\nMiners would\"work hard\"to ensure Maltby remained open, said a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) spokesman.\n\n'Stay focused'\n\nA company spokesman said the firm was awaiting geological reports. \n\nMike O'Sullivan, from Hargreaves Services, said:\"We have got reports that will be coming to us in a number of weeks which will advise us on all the various risk profiles associated with the geological problems and it's only when our board is in full possession of all the data that any decision will be properly made.\n\n\"We do not want, nor cannot have, any speculation at this stage.\"\n\nMr O'Sullivan said consultation with all the relevant unions would be\"standard procedure\".\n\nHe also confirmed that potential redundancies applied to all staff at Maltby and he said the number, he believed, was\"about 540\".\n\nDave Price, NUM branch secretary at Maltby, said he was optimistic the geological problems at the site could be solved.\n\nMiners would make the pit\"as difficult as possible for these people to shut\", said Mr Price.\n\n\"They will work hard to try and make it stay open.

Does Nicola Sturgeon have a mandate for today's decision? She says yes, unquestionably. In defence of this, she says that the SNP won the last Holyrood election with a record share of the constituency vote.\n\nAgainst that, rivals say the SNP did not retain their overall majority at Holyrood. Countering that again, it might be noted that there is a majority at Holyrood for independence, including the Greens. As will be demonstrated next week when those two parties vote together to urge a Section 30 transfer from Westminster.\n\nWhich brings us to Question Two. Section 30 refers to the portion of the 1998 Scotland Act, the Holyrood founding statute, which permits the transfer of other powers from the reserved section to the devolved criterion.\n\nIt has been used, for example, to transfer control over issues like rail transport to Holyrood. It was used, most significantly, to transfer power to hold the 2014 referendum, with agreement over the wording of questions and the timing of the plebiscite.\n\nWill the UK government agree to a transfer this time around? Not without detailed examination and negotiation.\n\nRead more from Brian here.\n\nThe first minister said the UK government had not\"moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise and agreement\"since the Brexit referendum, which saw Scotland vote by 62% to 38% in favour of Remain while the UK as a whole voted to leave by 52% to 48%.\n\nOn Monday evening, the House of Lords passed the Brexit bill, paving the way for the government to trigger Article 50 so the UK can leave the EU.\n\nPeers backed down over the issues of EU residency rights and a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal after their objections were overturned by MPs.\n\nMs Sturgeon said Scotland stood at a\"hugely important crossroads\", and insisted she would continue to attempt to reach a compromise with the UK government. \n\nBut she added:\"I will take the steps necessary now to make sure that Scotland will have a choice at the end of this process.\n\n\"A choice of whether to follow the UK to a hard Brexit, or to become an independent country able to secure a real partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and our own relationship with Europe.\"\n\n Ms Sturgeon continued:\"The Scottish government's mandate for offering this choice is beyond doubt. \n\n\"So next week I will seek the approval of the Scottish Parliament to open discussions with the UK government on the details of a Section 30 order - the procedure that will enable the Scottish Parliament to legislate for an independence referendum.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said it was\"important that Scotland is able to exercise the right to choose our own future at a time when the options are clearer than they are now, but before it is too late to decide on our own path.\"\n\nShe said that the detailed arrangements for a referendum - including its timing - should be for the Scottish Parliament to decide.\n\nBut she said it was important to be\"frank about the challenges we face and clear about the opportunities independence will give us to secure our relationship with Europe, build a stronger and more sustainable economy and create a fairer society.\"\n\nAnalysis by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor\n\nThe UK and Holyrood governments are set for a battle royale over timing over a potential vote.\n\nBut the question first is whether or not the prime minster is willing to grant a vote. Under the law, Westminster has to grant the referendum; it's not just down to the Scottish government.\n\nI'm told Number 10 had carefully worked out\"countermoves\"depending on what the first minister's message was this week.\n\nNow Sturgeon has made the first big move, it's down to the other side to respond.\n\nBut arguably we have just entered into the most complicated, most fraught, most fundamental period of political uncertainty for our country in a very long time.\n\nSturgeon's announcement confirms that it is not just our place in the EU that is changing, but the relationships between our own nations that are at question too.\n\nRead more from Laura\n\nMs Sturgeon will rely on the pro-independence Scottish Greens to give her plans majority support in the Scottish Parliament. \n\nPatrick Harvie, the party's co-convener, welcomed the announcement and confirmed the Greens would vote in favour of seeking a Section 30 order. \n\nHe added:\"The people of Scotland deserve a choice between Hard Brexit Britain and putting our own future in our own hands\".\n\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon had been\"utterly irresponsible\"and had\"given up acting as first minister for all of Scotland\".\n\nShe added people\"do not want to go back to the division\"of a referendum and that Ms Sturgeon had promised 2014 would be a\"once in a generation\"poll. \n\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said Scotland was\"already divided enough\"and\"we do not want to be divided again, but that is exactly what another independence referendum would do.\"\n\n'Democratic decision'\n\nBut the party's UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed that his MPs would not attempt to block a request for a Section 30 order. \n\nMr Corbyn said:\"Labour believes it would be wrong to hold another (referendum) so soon and Scottish Labour will oppose it in the Scottish Parliament. \n\n\"If, however, the Scottish Parliament votes for one, Labour will not block that democratic decision at Westminster. \n\n\"If there is another referendum, Labour will oppose independence because it is not in the interests of any part of the country to break up the UK.\"\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon's SNP had been\"working towards this announcement for months\"and were\"determined to contrive a way to ignore their promise that 2014 was'once in a generation'.\"\n\nHe added that there was\"no wide public support for a new and divisive referendum\".\nTL;DR: Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she will ask for permission to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence.\n\nArticle: By Ahmed MaherBBC News, Tunis\n\nAziza cannot help crying every time she looks at a picture of her only son who has gone to fight in a battle she neither supports nor understands - the battle for Syria.\n\nI met the heart-broken mother at her one-bedroom flat in one of the slums on the outskirts of the capital city, Tunis. \n\nIt has been more than a year since 22-year-old Bilal went to declare jihad, or holy war, alongside rebels in Syria against government forces. \n\nAnd she agonises over his picture all the time. \n\n\"Bilal was a good, caring son. He was the main source of income for the family, especially after his father died two years ago,\"said Aziza, fighting back her tears. \n\nShe remembers the moment he left. \n\n\"One day he told me and his sister that he was going to Libya to buy clothes and sell them at high prices in Tunis. He never came back. We knew later he was captured in Syria.\"\n\nThe jihadist trend has picked up steam in several Arab countries following the Syria revolution, which has entered its third year. \n\nAs more blood is shed in Syria's conflict between the government and the rebels, more young Muslims are being radicalised to fight in Syria.\n\nThis is not the first time that Tunisian men have taken part in jihadist activity. Security estimates say that hundreds fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n'Not a terrorist' \n\nAziza found out about her son's fate last month when the Syrian government released a second list of foreign fighters, who they say had sneaked into the country to support the\"terrorists\"- a catch-all term that the government has been using to describe the rebels since the start of the revolution-turned-conflict more than two years ago.\n\nThe mother showed me a copy of this list, which was published in the Tunisian press. \n\nAll of the 26 names on the list are Tunisian, and they include Bilal's full name, his home address, date of birth and his mother's name. \n\nWhat breaks her heart is that her son has been called\"terrorist\"in some Tunisian media outlets.\n\n\"He is not a terrorist but a victim. I don't know who brainwashed him into going to Syria. He could have stayed in his country and helped with money or clothes.\"\n\nThe phenomenon of young men fighting in Syria has raised alarm on the streets of Tunis. \n\nThe government publicly puts the number of Tunisians fighting in Syria at about 800.\n\nBut interior ministry sources told me the number was much higher.\n\n\"They are around 2,000,\"a security source said on condition of anonymity. \n\n\"Only 150 of them have returned. Most of them have been imprisoned for questioning.\"\n\nIt is hard to get authentic statistics for foreign fighters in Syria as the armed opposition is already divided into splinter groups and fighting along different frontlines. The number often quoted in the media is 5,000.\n\nRebel sources in the southern city of Deraa, the birthplace of the Syrian revolution, said that Tunisian jihadists form one of the biggest forces of foreign fighters in the war-torn country.\n\n'Humanitarian mission'\n\nMany secular Tunisians attribute the rise in radical Islam to the religious discourse of some Islamist preachers known as Salafists, who adopt a strict interpretation of their religion. \n\nFollowing the 2010-11 Tunisian revolution. which ousted long-time President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, the Salafist-jihadist activity has increased significantly in an atmosphere of free politics and almost absent security. \n\nBefore the revolution, state surveillance of mosques across Tunisia was a fact of life.\n\nIn today's Tunisia, the state has lost control of most of the mosques to Salafist groups. \n\nMany imams, like Sheikh Bashir bin Hassan, endorse jihad in Syria openly and are proud of what they see as the\"heroic acts of the young jihadists\". \n\n\"They are on a humanitarian mission. The West insists on associating jihad and Salafism to terrorism, which is not true,\"Sheikh Bashir told me in an interview inside a mosque in the town of Masakin, 200km (124 miles) south of Tunis. \n\nFor Sheikh Bashir, it is justifiable for Sunni Muslims to take arms against the Assad forces, who belong to a Shia sect, to protect oppressed fellow Sunnis - a stance that reflects the sectarian overtone of the conflict. \n\nAnd he accuses the West of double standards. \n\n\"Let's imagine that the British government decided to attack a county with scud missiles to stamp out a peaceful rebellion. Europeans would be watching entire families being slaughtered day in day out. What would the young do? They would flock in droves to England to protect the oppressed.\"\n\nDialogue \n\nTunisia's Islamist-led coalition government is widely accused by the secular opposition of turning a blind eye to the rise in jihadists. \n\nThe government denies this but does admit it is difficult to monitor potential jihadists leaving the country's airports.\n\n\"They are faking tourism trips to Turkey and Lebanon,\"said Habib Ellouz, a leading member of parliament for the ruling Islamist Ennahda party.\n\nHe was referring to the two main crossing points for jihadists into Syria.\n\n\"It is easy to get to Syria - just fly to Turkey or Lebanon and you will be over the border and into the action,\"he added. \n\nMr Ellouz says the authorities cannot prevent Tunisians from travelling.\n\n\"We did not revolt against a dictator to now deny people freedom of movement. Police state tactics do not work. The only way to counter radicalisation of those unemployed youths is dialogue and moderate preaching.\"\n\nThe government says it will leave no stone unturned to repatriate captured Tunisians. But the process is not easy.\n\nTunisia has cut diplomatic ties with Syria in protest at the Assad regime's heavy-handed response to the rebellion. This means that getting any information about captured Tunisians is difficult - and getting them extradited is even more so. \n\nBack at her apartment, waiting is the hardest thing for Aziza. \n\nThe charge her son faces in Damascus is serious: Belonging to al-Qaeda's network of fighters could carry the death penalty.\nTL;DR: Tunisia's government says that some 800 of its citizens are fighting alongside Islamist rebels in Syria, although some estimates put the figure much higher. As radicalised young Muslims increasingly join the conflict, what of the families - and the political dilemma - they leave behind?\n\nArticle: By Bethany DawsonBBC Ouch\n\nIt said a shortage of information about safe study, accommodation and support was\"concerning\"so close to term.\n\nThe government says universities should convey any plans\"clearly\"to students.\n\nBut some students fear they may have to shield in bedrooms and have called for more detail on safety measures.\n\nBeth Bale has been shielding due to Crohn's Disease and a hormone deficiency and says she is concerned about the safety of accommodation and the possibility of a second wave.\n\n\"What if I get back to university and then four weeks in I'm asked to shield again and I can no longer access my kitchen or leave my room? My little box room will be all I have to ensure that I'm safe.\"\n\n'Further risk to lives'\n\nIt is a fear echoed by many students among the 2.2 million people asked to shield by the UK government at the start of lockdown, which ended on 1 August.\n\nBut with just weeks before term begins, vulnerable students have said there has been little communication about what they can expect, in part, because universities themselves are grappling with an unprecedented situation.\n\nThe University of Surrey said it plans to\"contact all new students\"to see what support it can offer, and will try to meet specific accommodation requirements. But it said it doesn't actually have any plans in place yet.\n\nThe NUS said a\"lack of clarity\"from many universities about coronavirus measures was\"concerning\".\n\nSara Khan, who looks after student equality for the NUS, said:\"Clear support pathways must be outlined for students moving into accommodation safely and accessing mental health services physically or remotely.\n\n\"A failure to put these plans into action will pose further risk to the lives of students, particularly shielding students.\"\n\nThe lack of specific information is something that worries Jennifer Geminiani who has been shielding for five months due to having the blood disorder Thalassemia, which can lead to complications in the body's organs.\n\nShe is about to start a master's degree in terrorism and politics at the University of St Andrews.\n\nRather than risk living in university accommodation she has decided to pay more for private housing, which she says gives her\"security and certainty\".\n\n\"I'm hoping that the student body will receive regular Covid-19 tests so that people can go safely and without worry to university.\"\n\nShe said her university life was already impacted by coronavirus before the summer break.\n\n\"I worked twice as hard as I used too, because I couldn't see my lecturers. I think what impacted me most was also not being able to see my friends. I love their presence, their ideas and thoughts.\"\n\nLike Jennifer, Emma Beeden, a student at the University of Sussex, wants tangible safety measures put in place. She shielded following a kidney transplant. \n\n\"I am hoping the university as a whole will enforce mask-wearing as I know this is something that will make myself and others feel safer. I am sure the university has put lots of things in place, but it would be nice to know exactly what's going on.\"\n\nThe University of Sussex said its student support team would work with students who have long-term health conditions and those \"anxious about returning to campus\"to find\"reasonable adjustments\"for them.  \n\nBut for those students who are on work placements as part of their degree, the worry around safety is just as acute.\n\nLauren Bradfield has Beh\u00e7et's disease, which causes inflammation of the blood vessels and tissues.\n\nAs a second year student of paramedic sciences at the University of Surrey her hospital placement was cancelled at the start of lockdown to protect her health, but she is worried this will impact the completion of her degree.\n\n\"I am having to choose between my health and my career which is an awful decision to have to make. It feels almost impossible to plan going forward.\"\n\nWith just a few weeks to go before students leave the safety of their family homes there still remains a lot of uncertainty.\n\nThe Department for Education said universities are\"autonomous institutions and we expect them to make judgements based on the latest public health guidance and communicate these clearly to students.\"\n\nIt said this includes carrying out risk assessments and it had\"already seen a host of innovative measures being adopted, such as limiting travel times and student number rotas,\"although it did not say where these had been implemented.\n\nWhile students anxiously await information that will ensure their safety, what has become clear is that post-lockdown learning is about far more than fine-tuning online lectures, it has also become a key lesson in health management.\nTL;DR: A lack of clarity from universities about how they will protect students who had to shield during lockdown \"will pose further risk\" to lives, the National Union of Students has warned.\n\nArticle: By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News\n\nFact often mirrors fiction in the world of spies.\n\nBefore Thursday, if you had wanted to see British spy chiefs appear before parliamentarians and the cameras, your only opportunity would have been in the last James Bond film, Skyfall.\n\nDame Judi Dench, playing M, had just lectured the assembled audience about why spies were still needed in the modern world when the villain of the tale burst into the room with guns blazing.\n\nSecurity is going to be tight in Parliament but no-one is quite expecting such a dramatic afternoon. \n\nThe real-life hearing may be missing Dame Judi but it still will, in part, be about theatre and performance.\n\nDespite the presence of so many people who know so much, no-one should expect any secrets to be spilled.\n\nThat is not the intention of the hearing -

It is true I slapped her. But I didn't abuse her.\"When asked about his response to her claims - which included that the relationship was violent - he said:\"If she says that, that's up to her. It's not true I hit her.\"\n\nNicole Jacobs, England's domestic abuse commissioner, wrote to the newspaper to say she was\"deeply concerned\"about the story.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that the Sun has chosen to repeat and magnify the voice of someone who openly admits to violence against a partner,\"she said.\n\n'Irresponsible and dangerous'\n\nThe charity Women's Aid said the newspaper's front page had a\"negative impact\", and added it was in conversation with the Sun about reflecting the voices of survivors of domestic abuse.\n\n\"Headlines matter,\"it added.\n\nSome 20 anti-domestic abuse campaigners - including the chief executive of Women's Aid - wrote an open letter calling on the paper to apologise.\n\n\"Responding to a woman disclosing her experiences of domestic abuse and sexual assault by giving a platform to her perpetrator to trivialise the abuse he subjected her to is irresponsible and dangerous,\"the letter said.\n\nPress regulator Ipso said it had received more than 500 complaints about the Sun article.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Sun said:\"It was certainly not our intention to'enable' or'glorify' domestic abuse, our intention was to expose a perpetrator's total lack of remorse. Our sympathies are always with the victims.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added that the tabloid had a\"long history of standing up for abused women\", and\"over the we have empowered countless victims to come forward and seek help\".\n\nPoliticians have also criticised the Sun's coverage. The Liberal Democrats called on the Sun to donate the revenue made from Friday's newspaper to Refuge - while Labour's shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, Jess Phillips, said\"doubt and disbelief\"benefited perpetrators of abuse.\n\nThe row about Rowling's comments on transgender issues began last weekend, after she responded to a headline on an online article discussing\"people who menstruate\"by writing in a tweet:\"I'm sure there used to be a word for those people.

I have been since before and when we made that change. \n\n\"I don't think we should overreact, but equally of course we should pay attention to outbreaks in call centres, pharmacies and pubs\"\n\nHe added:\"But there could come a time when we have to go backwards, no question, if we began to see clusters developing or community transmission at a higher level around the country.\"\n\nHe cited the Australian state of Victoria, which has declared a state of disaster and imposed strict new lockdown measures after a spike in cases.\n\nProf Leitch said health authorities were expecting small clusters around in-door hospitality and that no one thought it was going to be a\"smooth journey\", but that there was\"no risk-free route\"out of lockdown.\n\nFigures from the Scottish government on Sunday showed 31 new cases of coronavirus overall in Scotland in a 24-hour period.\n\nThat is the highest daily tally for more than eight weeks.\n\nDespite the rise in cases, there were no deaths reported in Scotland due to coronavirus over the same period.\nTL;DR: Scotland's national clinical director has said there has to be a \"reverse gear\" over easing lockdown after 27 Covid-19 cases were linked to a pub.\n\nArticle: Emergency services were called to a property in the Muirhouse area of the city at about 09:30 on Saturday morning.\n\nThe boy had serious injuries and died at the scene shortly afterwards.\n\nLucasz Czapla, 40, was also charged with driving over the alcohol limit, dangerous driving and failing to stop a vehicle.\n\nHe appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Monday where he made no plea and was remanded in custody.\n\nDet Ch Insp Lynn McFall said:\"I'd like to thank the local people in the Muirhouse community for their help during this inquiry.

Not force people to register to vote.\"\n\nJessica Blair, director of the Electoral Reform Society Cymru, welcomed the proposals as\"innovative ideas to modernise our democracy\". \n\n\"It is an opportunity for Wales to lead the way in creating a political system that works for everybody and it is particularly pertinent as we recognise the centenary of the first women getting the vote,\"she said.\n\nMs Blair said the society's Missing Voices project on election turnout\"revealed an appetite for doing things differently\". \n\n\"We believe these recommendations are the first step in making that happen,\"she said.\n\nChildren's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said she was\"very pleased to see votes at 16 moving a step closer\". \n\n\"The overwhelming message from young people who I've spoken to about this is that it's a very welcome step, although they want more information and education on political issues in school,\"she said.\nTL;DR: Ballot boxes in supermarkets and Sunday voting could be trialled by local councils as a way to boost election turnout, a Welsh minister has said.\n\nArticle: He unveiled a plaque to say thank you to workers on a visit to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham with the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nThe hospital trust is thought to have treated the most Covid-positive patients of any NHS trust in the UK.\n\nPrince Charles added:\"We are very lucky indeed to have you.\"\n\n\"There are masses of people who are unsung and unseen heroes and heroines but we owe them such an enormous debt of gratitude and so many of you particularly. \n\n\"The pressures are huge,\"he said.\n\nThe University Hospitals Birmingham Trust also runs Good Hope, Heartlands and Solihull hospitals in the West Midlands.\n\nIt is thought to have treated 12,500 Covid-positive patients, with 10,000 of those being discharged.\n\nNathan Samuels, a consultant nurse at the hospital, said Prince Charles spoke to him on the visit about his admiration for their efforts.\n\n\"He showed a great deal of empathy, which was really refreshing and he seemed very genuine,\"he said.\n\nThe royals, who got their first vaccine dose last week, also met, at a distance, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in their first joint official public event for two months.\n\nMr Hancock told staff in the vaccine programme:\"From the bottom of my heart, from everybody across Birmingham, across the country, we are really grateful and it is so wonderful, the spirit that there is in this programme.\"\n\nThe hospital trust has also recruited 1,000 patients for the vaccine trials.\n\nThey started a trial in February to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well as the current approach of using the same type of vaccine twice.\n\nConsultant Christopher Green, principal investigator for the trial, said he hoped their work would help people in their choice over having the jab.\n\n\"As we go through the trials, as we accumulate reliable data, hopefully that will help people come to a decision about whether to accept a vaccine in the future,\"he said.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The old suburb was cleared during post-war redevelopment.\n\nThe museum hope the pub will help tell the story of an expanding and changing Cardiff at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th Centuries.\n\nThe pub was bought by compulsory purchase order five years ago as part of redevelopments and last orders were called for the final time in May 2012.\nTL;DR: Plans have been submitted to rebuild one of Cardiff's oldest pubs at St Fagans National History Museum.\n\nArticle: He was defending the 11 new bills that make up the coalition's plans for its final year in power before an election.\n\nHighlights include pension reforms, new rights for fracking firms and limited power to recall misbehaving MPs.\n\nLabour sources said it was\"staggering\"that the NHS and immigration were not mentioned in the Queen's Speech.\n\nEd Miliband said the speech failed to match the scale of the challenges Britain faces. The Labour leader told MPs:\"We would have a Queen's Speech with legislation which would make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes again in Britain. \n\n\"A Queen's Speech which signals a new direction for Britain, not one which offers more of the same.\"\n\nMr Cameron said the government's\"long-term economic plan is working but there is much, much more to do,\"adding that it would\"take the rest of this Parliament and the next to finish the task of turning our country around\".\n\nHe accused Mr Miliband of having a\"rag bag, pick-and-mix selection of statist Seventies ideas\", describing them as a\"revival of Michael Foot's policies paid for by (Unite union leader) Len McCluskey's money\".\n\nAmong the measures announced were:\n\nThe Queen presided over the state opening of Parliament for the 63rd time, amid the traditional pomp and ceremony.\n\n\"My government's legislative programme will continue to deliver on its long-term plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society,\"she said in a speech written for her by ministers.\n\n\"To strengthen the economy and provide stability and security, my ministers will continue to reduce the country's deficit, helping to ensure that mortgage and interest rates remain low.\"\n\nThere was a moment of drama towards the end of the speech when one of the Queen's page boys, who carry her train as she arrives and leaves the chamber, appeared to faint.\n\n A loud thud could be heard in the House of Lords, as she spoke of the need to work towards a\"comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran\".\n\n The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, who were sat nearest to the boy, showed concern as help was called to assist him and he was carried out of the chamber. \n\nMPs are debating the planned legislation in the Commons. \n\nIn a joint statement released alongside the speech, Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg took steps to reject the idea that the months leading up to next May's general election would be dominated by Conservative and Lib Dem wrangling.\n\nThe PM and deputy PM said the coalition was\"still taking bold steps\"to\"take Britain forward to a brighter future\". \n\n\"We may be two parties, with two different philosophies but we understand one thing,\"they added. \n\n\"Countries rise when their people rise. So this Queen's Speech is unashamedly pro-work, pro-business and pro-aspiration.\"\n\nSpeculation ahead of the speech that it could include a fresh crackdown on immigration, in the wake of UKIP's success in the European and local elections, proved groundless.\n\nBut it did include a renewed commitment to the Help to Buy scheme, following criticism from the European Commission and others that it is fuelling an unsustainable housing boom. The Speech also repeated David Cameron's commitment to promote reform of the European Union\"including a stronger role for member states and national parliaments\".\n\nPlans to support the development of shale gas by the\"fracking\"process are among the most controversial measures included in the Speech.\n\nEnough to kill off Labour's'zombie government' claim?\n\nAnalysis by Iain Watson\n\nJust about every Labour MP who has graced a broadcast studio has denounced the coalition as a\"zombie government\". The dictionary describes such a creature as\"mute and listless\"with only\"the semblance of life\". Zombies, that is, not MPs. The evidence? Well, there are fewer bills being proposed since\u2026 er, the last year of the last Labour government, under Gordon Brown. Fans of the horror genre will be aware that zombies may well be listless - but they are not benign, and can often harm living beings. What will really be causing Labour nightmares won't be any lack of new bills by a\"zombie\"government. It will be whether, with signs of an economic recovery, the government - and primarily the Conservatives - will remain more trusted to hold the nation's purse strings by the time of the general election.  \n\nGreenpeace activists, who say the Infrastructure Bill will clear the way for fracking firms to drill under people's land and property without their permission, staged a protest at David Cameron's Oxfordshire home.\n\nThe activists erected security fencing around the prime minister's cottage in the Cotswold hamlet of Dean and put up a sign saying:\"We apologise for any inconvenience we may cause while we frack under your home\".\n\nThe state opening of Parliament, one of the highlights of the Westminster calendar, used to take place in the autumn but was moved to the early summer by the coalition government. This year saw the Queen travel to the event in her new Diamond Jubilee carriage.\n\nWheel\n\nStone\n\nWood\n\nCrown\n\nCarriage technology\n\nWheel\n\n\n\nThe wheels - cast in aircraft aluminium - feature the name of coach designer and builder Australian Jim Frecklington.  It was originally intended to reach the Queen in time for her 80th birthday, but various delays meant it took 10 years to complete. It has been bought by the Royal Collection Trust for an undisclosed sum and will go on display at the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace.\n\nStone of Destiny\n\n\n\nA piece of the Stone of Destiny, used for centuries in the coronation of monarchs, is set into a panel below the seats. The seats themselves are upholstered in pastel gold-coloured silk brocade. Other decorations include a bolt from a Spitfire, a musket ball from the battle of Waterloo and a fragment of a 617 Squadron Dambuster. The doors are inlaid with diamonds and sapphires.\n\nWood\n\n\n\nThe interior walls and doors of the carriage are inlaid with small varnished wooden squares from a range of historic sources, such as Henry VIII\u2019s warship Mary Rose, Westminster Abbey, the Tower of London and the apple tree, which inspired Sir Isaac Newton to form his theory of gravity. The handrails are made from Royal Yacht Britannia timber. \n\nCrown\n\n\n\nThe golden crown on the roof was carved from wood from Lord Nelson\u2019s flagship, HMS Victory. In total, about 400 books of gold leaf were used to decorate the vehicle.\n\nCarriage technology\n\n\n\nThe carriage is fitted with gold-plated hydraulics, to ensure a smooth ride. Inside, it also has a heater, electric windows and a 360-degree camera, to give a monarch's view of the procession.\n\nPlans in the speech to introduce a power of recall for misbehaving MPs sparked controversy. The idea was promised in the 2010 coalition agreement but was thought to have been dropped after rows between senior Conservative and Lib Dem ministers.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, a recall will only be triggered if MPs are given jail sentences of less than 12 months or if the House of Commons resolves that they have engaged in\"serious wrongdoing\". Voters would then have to collect the signatures of 10% of constituents to force a by-election.\n\nConservative backbencher Zac Goldsmith, who has been campaigning for tougher recall powers, said the proposed bill was\"worse than meaningless\"because a committee of MPs would still have the final say. \n\nHe said it would be\"a waste of Parliament's time\"unless it can be amended.\n\nJames Landale on historical significance of the occasion\n\n\"As you watch the state opening of parliament, remember it is one of the strongest ceremonial demonstrations of our liberty that we have. Democracy is not just the freedom to vote out a government we dislike; it is also the freedom not to be ruled by an autocratic monarch chosen by God. It is what our ancestors fought over in the civil war. And it is a right that we are reminded of every year.\"James Landale on how the Queen's Speech show us who isn't boss.\n\nLiberal Democrat president Tim Farron said that the Queen's Speech was\"very substantial\", telling the BBC's World at One:\"I suspect the pensions proposals will be around for a generation or more and will be remembered. It's about making sure they are fairer, cheaper, more secure, more reliable and potentially better for people.\"\n\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas accused the government of ignoring public opinion on the proposed fracking law and said ministers were\"steamrolling through legislation that will deny people any say in what happens to the very ground beneath their homes\". \n\nPlaid Cymru's leader at Westminster, Elfyn Llwyd, also expressed concern about the fracking plans, and added:\"This was an uninspired Queen's Speech delivered by a government that has well and truly run out of steam.\"\n\nThe SNP said the final Queen's Speech before Scotland votes on independence contained nothing to win over Scottish voters.\n\nUKIP's head of policy, MEP for the East of England Tim Aker, said the Queen's Speech contained no policies on issues the general public care about.\n\n\"The decision to only offer recall voting on a signed-off-by-Parliament-basis reflects a political class that does not know, does not trust and certainly does not represent its people. As far as I can tell, the contents of the Queen's Speech shows just why that democratic gulf is widening and UKIP are growing so rapidly in the polls,\"he added.\n\nIn addition to the 11 new bills there are six other ones - including one authorising the building of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands - being carried over from the last session. \n\nThere are also three draft bills, setting out legislation to improve compensation for people whose property has been damaged in riots, protect charities from abuse and improve the governance of national parks in England.\nTL;DR: David Cameron has hailed the Queen's Speech as \"a packed programme of a busy and radical government\" amid claims the coalition has run out of steam.\n\nArticle: By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent\n\nUniversities Minister Jo Johnson said he wanted\"tough action\"against the spread of plagiarism and the commercial industry it has spawned.\n\nThe Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) said hundreds of\"essay mills\"were charging up to \u00a36,750 for writing a PhD dissertation.\n\nMr Johnson said it could\"undermine\"the reputation of degrees from the UK.\n\n\"Essay mills are a major challenge for universities and colleges,\"said the QAA's Ian Kimber. \n\n\"Because, unlike other forms of cheating, the practice is notoriously difficult to detect.\"\n\nTougher penalties\n\nLast summer the QAA, which monitors standards in higher education, published a report into the scale of such commercial plagiarism.\n\nIt found essay services with charges - depending on length, complexity and speed of turnaround - from \u00a315 to thousands of pounds.\n\nMany claimed to produce customised work that was\"100% plagiarism free\".\n\nThe watchdog said it was difficult to estimate how widely such services were being used.\n\nThere were about 17,000 cases a year of\"academic offences\", it said, but there was no breakdown of how many of these involved students who had used essay writing services.\n\nEssay-writing websites often carry disclaimers suggesting the essays being sold should be used only as examples and not passed off as students' own work.\n\nThe universities minister wants a more co-ordinated response to the problem.\n\nMr Johnson is asking the standards watchdog to take action against essay mills advertising their services to students.\n\nHe also wants stronger guidance for students, including\"tough new penalties for those who make use of essay mills websites\".\n\n\"This form of cheating is unacceptable, and every university should have strong policies and sanctions in place to detect and deal with it,\"said Mr Johnson. \n\n\"Essay mill websites threaten to undermine the high quality reputation of a UK degree, so it is vital that the sector works together to address this in a consistent and robust way.\"\n\nDame Julia Goodfellow, president of Universities UK, said:\"Universities have severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own. \n\n\"Such academic misconduct is a breach of an institution's disciplinary regulations and can result in students, in serious cases, being expelled from the university.\"\n\nThis has been a longstanding problem - and a decade ago Google announced that it would stop running adverts from essay writing services, but such businesses can still be found through online searches.\nTL;DR: The universities watchdog is being asked to pursue websites advertising essay-writing services for students.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent\n\nThe revelation that this notoriously wet peak should have times of near-zero humidity comes from the analysis of a newly recovered, unique data-set.\n\nWeather observations were made around the clock by a group of men who lived atop Ben Nevis from 1883 to 1904. \n\nTheir records have now been digitised for modern science by volunteers. \n\nThe rescue effort has provided new insights, not just on the nature of the meteorology at the summit of this 1,345m-high Scottish Munro but of conditions in general across the British Isles in the late 19th Century. \n\n\"These men on Ben Nevis were really puzzled why, for a couple of days, the air would be as dry as it could be, when most of the time they would be living inside a cloud and 100% humidity!\"said Prof Ed Hawkins from Reading University.\n\n\"Today, we recognise that dry air can sometimes descend from the stratosphere to near the surface in high pressure systems. So, while it was a mystery for them, we can now go back and reanalyse their data to see these events unfold and explain them.\"\n\nThe famous\"Weathermen of Ben Nevis\"would take measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity on the hour, every hour. Quite a challenge in the worst of winters.  \n\nTheir activity was an early attempt to understand how conditions varied with altitude. This, remember, was a time long before the widespread use of radiosondes (weather balloons) and satellites.\n\nAnd in that sense the men's dedication paid dividends, even if they didn't always fully comprehend what their instruments were observing. \n\nStephen Burt, also from Reading, said such ultra low-humidity events would have been totally unrecognisable to anyone used to taking measurements closer to sea-level.\n\n\"There is only a single reliably documented instance of a humidity below 10%, far less approaching zero, at any lowland site in the British Isles,\"he told BBC News. \n\n\"At RAF Honington in Suffolk, the humidity fell to 8% at 1400 GMT on 30 June 1976, during that summer's intense heatwave. In contrast, the Ben Nevis Observatory recorded values of 10% or less on 368 hours in 21 years 1883-1904, an average of 17 hours every year.\"\n\nAn account of the Ben Nevis humidity records is reported this week by the Reading team in the International Journal of Climatology.\n\nCitizen scientists have managed to digitise nearly all of the weathermen's observations, which were kept in bound volumes after their operation was closed down.\n\nProfessional researchers are using some of this information to reconstruct major events, such as the destructive 1903\"Ulysses storm\", so-called because it was mentioned in James Joyce's classic novel.\n\nRescuing old weather data is therefore a hugely productive endeavour as it helps put modern events in context.\n\nJust last week, which was British Science Week, there was a big push for volunteers to help convert the Met Office's\"Daily Weather Reports\"from 1861 to 1865.\n\nThese were started by Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy shortly after he founded the national weather agency. The observations, which were taken at a small selection of stations in the UK and parts of Western Europe, are in handwritten tables. They need to be put into a form that computers can use.\n\nBy the end of Science Week, some 1,200 volunteers had completed about 300,000 tasks. Citizen scientists are needed to crack on with the 1866-1867 data this week.\n\nProf Hawkins said:\"As an example of why we are doing this: there was a severe flooding event near Leeds in November 1866 which this rescued data will help us better understand. That event was only beaten by the remarkable events of December 2015 which occurred in a very different concrete landscape.\"\n\nFor Stephen Burt, the rescue work is a way of paying tribute to the pioneering spirit of the early meteorologists.\n\n\"My greatest value in revisiting the Ben Nevis observations? Seeing the records made on the summit, in often incredibly hazardous and inclement circumstances, made available to modern science at last,\"he told BBC News.\n\n\"State-of-the-art instruments, dedicated observers, very high-quality published records and now 3,500+ crowd-sourced volunteers have given us the ultimate mountain weather record, one that will prove to be of immense benefit to all sorts of applications in the coming years.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: Ben Nevis - the highest mountain in Britain - occasionally experiences periods at its summit when the air is bone dry.\n\nArticle: By Willie JohnstonBBC Scotland\n\nHe runs a beef and sheep business near Dumfries.  He is also vice president of the Scottish NFU and understands more than most how much the industry is underpinned by European farm payments.  \n\n\"I can't think there will be many farms that have a profit without the support from the EU,\"he admitted. \"It is a big, big part of our income... as the market isn't rewarding us for what we are doing.\" \n\nIn the last Common Agricultural Policy re-negotiation for the period 2014 to 2020 more than \u00a34.5bn was earmarked for Scotland.  With 500 million consumers, the European market accounts for 73% of the UK's agri-food exports, including 40% of Scottish lamb.  \n\nOn the face of it, voting to leave that market would appear to be like turkeys voting for Christmas.\n\nStranraer dairy farmer Gary Mitchell, fed up of EU regulation and red tape, did exactly that.\n\n\"I grew up in a generation where we have been totally focussed on claiming subsidy on everything we do,\"he said. \"We have to ask why are we doing it; running at a loss and hoping somebody's going to send a cheque from Europe to make up the deficit.\"\n\nMr Mitchell said it was time for change and Brexit was the opportunity.  \n\n\"The whole European subsidy structure hasn't been working for the UK,\"he said.\n\n\"We are seeing incomes decline and production decline and we need to reverse that.  That's what excites me about Brexit.  We now have the power coming back into our own hands to make decisions that suit our rural economies.\"\n\nThere is no clear vision as to what the future will look like or how we will get there, but might the UK look overseas to see how things might be done differently?  New Zealand, for example. \n\nFaced with a budget crisis in the 1980s, the Kiwi government scrapped farm subsidies altogether.  The industry survived and, eventually, thrived although Dr William Rolleston, president of the Federated Farmers of New Zealand, conceded it wasn't easy.\n\n\"People had made a lot of investment decisions based on what they thought they were going to receive in income,\"he said.\n\n\"A number of farmers found it particularly hard and didn't survive the transition if they had maybe bought farms and borrowed heavily.\"\n\nDr Rolleson said farms, in general, got a bit bigger and farmers' outlook as well.  The agricultural economy diversified and farmers were able to make decisions based on market realities and not what subsidies locked them into.\n\n'Totally disadvantaged'\n\nHe said there was no prospect of turning back the clock. \n\n\"If you ask around the farming community in New Zealand, I don't think anyone would say we should go back to the days of the subsidies,\"he said.\n\n\"We see production subsidies a bit like social welfare;  you get trapped into a particular system and it's just so hard to get out.\"\n\nGetting out of the EU WILL be a catalyst for change in the UK, but is the New Zealand model the answer?  Not according to Mr McCornick who pinpointed two reasons for the continuation of support payments in some form, particularly in Scotland.\n\n\"If we are trying to sell into a European market which is our nearest neighbour, farmers there will be still be receiving support,\"he said.\n\n\"We're going to be needing a similar kind of support or we're going to be so totally disadvantaged it will hardly be worth getting up in the morning.\"\n\n\"Also, the nature of the land in Scotland is challenging,\"he added. \"Only 15% is prime arable land; 85% isn't.  If you look across the border to England it's virtually the flip of that; 85% is better land.  \n\n\"This (EU) support, it supports communities and it supports the food industry... an important part of the Scottish rural economy and we have to have the basis to make that work.\"\n\nThe NFU are buying time to try to work out what does happen next.  They've been told that most, if not all, of the funding that would have come from Europe from now until 2020 will be paid from UK or Scottish government coffers if Brexit is achieved before then.  \n\nBrexiteer farmer Mr Mitchell said that breathing space must be used well.  \n\n'Blank page'\n\nHe voiced optimism that a way could be found to reduce farming's reliance on subsidies.  He wants the UK to be more self-sufficient in food and reduce its dependence on imports.\n\nBut he said farmers could still be competitive in a world export market eager to buy quality Scottish-label produce with the weaker pound already helping that. \n\nDespite not wanting Brexit, Mr McCornick said it can, and must, be made to work.\n\n\"I wouldn't say it's a blank page, but we certainly do need to consider what market we are going to be supplying and how we get access to that market,\"he said.\n\n\"We've got to get all that pinned down and then we will see how things evolve and I think we can get something more bespoke to suit Scottish agriculture.\n\n\"We're outwith the EU and we have to deal with that.\"\nTL;DR: Andrew McCornick is typical of many Scottish family farmers.\n\nArticle: The current account figure from the Office for National Statistics measures the difference between imports and exports of trade and investment.\n\nThe deficit narrowed from \u00a324bn, or 5.2% of national income, in the first quarter of 2015, to \u00a316.8bn, or 3.6% of GDP, in the second.\n\nThe ONS also announced a number of revisions to economic growth.\n\nIt revised upwards the growth figures for years between 2011 and 2013, which meant that the economy is now 5.9% above its pre-recession peak, compared with previous estimates of 5.2%.\n\nIt also means that the economy passed its pre-recession level in the second quarter of 2013, which was a quarter earlier than previously thought.\n\n\"Upward revisions to GDP in earlier years mean that growth has averaged just over 2% in the six years since the economy started growing again in mid-2009,\"said Andrew Sentance at PwC.\n\n\"This is respectable growth in the new normal post-crisis world and puts the UK among the leading major western economies -

in the wake of 9/11 and 7/7 - they asked ministers for more powers.\n\nEach time there has been a difficult debate about the balance between those powers and personal liberties.\n\nThis coming bill - which is aimed at disrupting extremist activity - will face the same questions.\n\nAgainst that background, a\"Counter-terrorism Awareness Week\"has something of a\"Dig for Victory\"spirit about it as the government and security chiefs seek public support ahead of potentially controversial legislation.\n\nBut PR tactics aside, the appeal is very squarely focused on the brutal fact that the police don't believe they can do this job alone.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband pledged that his party would co-operate with the government but added that it would seek to scrutinise Mrs May's proposals. \n\nLib Dem leader Nick Clegg praised the identification of IP address users as\"sensible\"but said that the home secretary\"wants to go a lot further\"by reviving what he called the\"disproportionate\"measures of\"the snoopers' charter\". \n\nHuman rights group Liberty condemned Mrs May's programme as a\"chilling recipe for injustice and resentment, closing down the open society she seeks to promote\".\n\nThe Counter-terrorism and Security Bill will be introduced to Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThe speech coincides with the start of a week-long police initiative -

And, frankly, the Conservative game plan seems extremely straightforward. \n\nTo illustrate that, here is a chart: each block represents a Tory-facing Labour seat (in red) or a Labour-facing Tory seat (in blue). And each stack of blocks tells you how many seats each party gains if they improve their polling, in 2 percentage points increments.\n\nSo, for example, the red stack left of the centre line is nine high. If the Tories were to uniformly poll 2 percentage points higher on election day than they did in 2015 relative to Labour, they would take nine seats. Conversely, a two-point improvement for Labour relative to the Tories would yield 12 seats. \n\nOf course, at the moment, the Conservatives are well ahead of where they were at the last general election, while Labour are doing much the same. Political scientist Dr Chris Hanretty from the University of East Anglia estimates the likely result is for the Conservatives to take seats, roughly as follows.\n\nThat dark blue zone is the area where, according to Dr Hanretty's maths, about 70 seats are now likely to go Conservative, having been Labour seats in 2015. Those seats - and seats like them - are the front line in this election. \n\nThe Theresa May game plan\n\nWe can overlay that graph with black blocks that show the sort of places where Theresa May has visited. \n\nWhat does this mean? Well, Mrs May is spending the bulk of her time in front line seats. She made one visit to Maidenhead, her own seat, which is the block to the far right. But it is very clear where she thinks the fight is - and it is roughly where Dr Hanretty thinks it is.\n\nThere is, though, a subtler game being played. We do not talk much about the importance to campaigns of getting on local TV and radio bulletins, which have huge audiences and credibility. But parties obsess over it. More people tune into BBC One's regional news bulletins at 6:30pm than the national news at 6pm. \n\nYou could divide the country into BBC radio or TV regions to illustrate this. But here, for example, are the number of days in which Mrs May has made a visit to each ITV region or sub-region. \n\nThat emphasis on the West Midlands and Yorkshire is telling: 28 of the seats that Dr Hanretty currently expects to flip are in those two areas. \n\nThis way of thinking may also clarify things for some activists who were puzzled as to why Theresa May went campaigning in rural Aberdeenshire. It put her into STV North, which covers a few target seats currently held by the SNP. And note, she only has one region yet to reach.\n\nMr Corbyn's visits, though, are harder to make sense of. Reproducing the same charts, you can see few of his visits have been into the seats that polling currently implies will change hands. On this chart, the black blocks represent his campaign trips. Of the battleground seats, Mr Corbyn has been to three.\n\nMr Corbyn is holding events in safe Labour seats and in Tory seats which, the polls suggest, are very unlikely to be won.  But he is not doing much in the zone in between, where seats are most likely to change hands. Why?\n\nExplaining the Labour strategy\n\nThe simplest answer is that Mr Corbyn's team simply think the polls are wrong. They think the Tory seats he's going to are going to go red - and the Tories are wasting their time fighting in seats that will stay with Labour. We will see. A less simple answer is that his campaign has chosen not to take him to the front line. Several Labour MPs in those seats have made it clear that they think his presence will not help them persuade swing voters. \n\nThis pattern has been noticed by some of his critics who wonder if this is about life after 8 June. Mr Corbyn, some Labour insiders say, is visiting safe seats where Labour activists are over-represented to bolster his place in the next Labour leadership race. Two Labour MPs suggested to me he is trying to maximise the popular Labour vote to help bolster his argument for staying on in the event of a defeat.\n\nBroadcasting, though, is a factor to consider in all this.

The Communist North has slipped into totalitarianism and poverty.\n\nArticle: Breivik, whose attacks shocked Norway, harboured radical right-wing views and had railed against what he saw as a Marxist Islamic takeover of Europe. \n\nWhile Breivik openly expressed his views online, there was little to indicate that the young man - described by friends as quiet, friendly and ordinary - would go on to kill dozens of people, many in cold blood.\n\nThe turning point seems to have come in his late 20s, when his paranoia grew about the\"Islamisation of western Europe\". After his arrest, he made no apology for the attacks, which he has described as\"atrocious, but necessary\"to defeat immigration.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to whether he was insane at the time of the killings. Two psychiatric analyses reached contradicting conclusions. \n\nAn initial court-ordered assessment concluded he was a paranoid schizophrenic, but a second report in early April ruled that he was not psychotic. \n\nThe issue will be at the centre of his trial, due to start on 16 April, and will determine whether he should be sent to a psychiatric ward or jail.\n\n'Policy of hatred'\n\nIt is perhaps Breivik's diary - part of his dense, wordy manifesto - that gives the most insight into his thought processes.  \n\nIn it, he describes how in early May 2011, he had prepared and stored his equipment for the attack. He talks of his paranoia at the number of police vehicles he sees near his home, wondering where he would hide, were they to pay him a visit.  \n\n\"It's one of the scariest documents I've ever read,\"forensic clinical psychologist Ian Stephen told the BBC.\n\n\"It's written by a man who is absolutely meticulous in his development of his philosophy and he has researched everything, obviously shut away for a long period of time reading, researching, digging into the internet, reading books,\"said the psychologist.\n\n\"[He] formulated this absolute policy of hatred of anything that is non-Nordic in a sense, and looking at planning how to take over the world [in a] rather insane, over-complicated deluded manner.\"\n\nA 12-minute anti-Muslim video called Knights Templar 2083, in which images of Breivik appear, was also discovered online.\n\nHe appears to have created entries on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, though the accounts were set up on 17 July, only five days before the attacks in Oslo and on the island of Utoeya, where a summer youth camp of the governing Labour Party was taking place.\n\nOn the Facebook page attributed to him, he described himself as a Christian and a conservative. The Facebook page is no longer available but it also listed interests such as bodybuilding and freemasonry.\n\nA Twitter account attributed to the suspect also emerged but it had only one post - a quote from philosopher John Stuart Mill:\"One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who have only interests.\"\n\nBreivik was also a member of a Swedish neo-Nazi internet forum called Nordisk, according to Expo, a Swedish group monitoring far-right activity. \n\n'Price of treason'\n\nAccording to court officials, he said he had been trying to\"save Norway and western Europe from cultural Marxism and a Muslim takeover.\"\n\n\"The accused explained that the Labour Party has failed the country and the people and the price of their treason is what they had to pay,\"said the judge in the case, Kim Heger.\n\nHe has admitted to carrying out the twin attacks, but has not pleaded guilty to charges of terrorism. \n\nHis 1,500-page manifesto - authored by\"Andrew Berwick\", the Anglicised version of his name - gives a detailed account of the author's\"preparation phases\", apparently for an\"armed struggle\"which he says seems\"futile at this point but... is the only way forward\".\n\nThe manifesto, called 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, minutely elaborates the author's belief that a process of\"Islamisation\"is under way.\n\nDuring this preparation, the author details how he sets up front companies to allow the purchase of fertiliser, which can be used in bomb-making, and the steps he takes to obtain powerful guns - including joining a firearms club in 2005 to increase his chances to obtain a Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol six years later.\n\nHe also claims to have bought three bottles of 1979 vintage French wine, and decides to open one with his family at Christmas as his\"martyrdom operation draws ever closer\".\n\nBreivik was previously a member of the right-wing Progress Party (FrP), the second largest party in Norway's parliament. He was also a member of the FrP youth wing from 1997 to 2006/2007. He deleted his membership in 2007.\n\n'Ordinary boy'\n\nBreivik was born on 13 February 1979 in Oslo. His mother had become pregnant in London where his father, a diplomat, had been posted. Jens Breivik - long estranged from his son - has expressed shock at the crime.\n\n\"I view this atrocity with absolute horror,\"he was quoted as saying by London's Daily Telegraph newspaper from his home in south-west France.\n\nHe divorced Anders' mother, a nurse, when their child was one year old, moved to Paris and married again. From then on, he had limited contact with the boy.\n\nTheir relationship broke down when Anders was a teenager, and the father and son have not spoken since then. \n\nBreivik said on his Facebook page that he was a student at Oslo Handelsgymnasium, a high school that specialises in business studies, Norwegian media reported. He also claimed to have educated himself beyond that, but not through any formal educational establishment.\n\nA school friend told Norwegian TV he did not recognise him as the boy he knew.\n\n\"One

as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after being accused of a similar sex attack.\n\nCharges were eventually dropped and Mr Strauss-Kahn subsequently reached a settlement out of court with the maid, Nafissatou Diallo.\n\nDepardieu, whose character is named George Devereaux in the film, acknowledged Welcome to New York was based on\"a subject everybody knew about from the media\".\n\nNot like him\n\n\"The image of this man was that he was brilliant,\"the 65-year-old said on Saturday.\"He could have been president.\"\n\nHowever, the actor said he did not base his performance on Mr Strauss-Kahn himself and that\"there was no identification to speak of\".\n\n\"The fun of it was having him in the back of my mind all the time,\"he said.\"The whole point was absolutely not to be like him or look like him.\"\n\nBritish actress Jacqueline Bisset plays Simone, the wife of Depardieu's banker, a character who bears similarities to Strauss-Kahn's estranged wife Anne Sinclair.\n\n\"I felt this story was a universal story,\"said the 69-year-old, who reportedly replaced French star Isabelle Adjani early in production.\n\n\"I had so much to work with as a woman and I had tremendous empathy for Gerard's character.\"\n\nImpulses and passions\n\nAccording to Depardieu, his character has a\"sickness\"that brings out the\"monster\"inside him.\n\n\"I never questioned the morality of my character,\"he went on.\"This man was not like me at all, but I do understand impulses and passions.\"\n\nWelcome to New York begins with a series of graphic sex scenes in which Depardieu's character is shown consorting with prostitutes in hotel suites in Washington DC and New York.\n\nHe is later seen being arrested, detained and subjected to a strip search, little of which is left to the imagination.\n\nFlashbacks shown subsequently show Devereaux seducing a young law student in Paris and sexually assaulting a resisting female journalist.\n\nFerrara, the US director best known for 1992's The Bad Lieutenant, defended the graphic nature of such scenes, saying it was\"not a choice\"on his part.\n\nHeightened poetry \n\n\"These are the places, these are the events,\"he said.\"We're not questioning the events.\n\n\"How violent is it? That's a question for him [Mr Strauss-Kahn], not for me.\"\n\nThe film, he went on, was\"a cross between documentary and a kind of heightened poetry\"that gave the viewer a\"fly on the wall\"perspective.\n\nDepardieu himself said he had\"hated\"the scenes in which he is violent towards women and that the part had been more\"tiring\"than Cyrano de Bergerac - the role for which he was Oscar nominated in 1991.\n\nWelcome to New York was not selected by festival organisers to be part of this year's official line-up.\n\nUproarious portrayal\n\nInstead of releasing the film theatrically in France, its producers have made it available via video on demand.

It's the other costs and whether they are sustainable over a long period of time.\"\n\nOpenings\n\nOei Hong Djien, a 73-year-old Indonesian tobacco tycoon, bought his first painting in 1965 and set up a museum 15 years ago almost by accident when he bought a house adjacent to his home as a place to store his collection of Indonesian art.\n\nHis OHD Museum in Magelang, Java has since expanded, with a new building that opened earlier this year that displays some of his collection of 2,000 artworks.\n\n\"Indonesia has the fourth greatest population in the world and we have a lot of great artists,\"he says.\n\n\"But we don't have a national museum and the government is not showing signs of going in that direction so us private collectors have to take over.\"\n\nIn China, Wang Wei is one of a growing number of wealthy collectors opening their own exhibition space.\n\nThe Shanghai-based Long Museum will showcase the collection of contemporary and revolutionary Chinese art she built with her billionaire husband.\n\nMs Wang expects the museum, named after the Chinese word for dragon, to open later this year but is hazy on many of the details including the management team, budget and admission fees.\n\nMuseums falter\n\nOthers are in the pipeline, but success is by no means guaranteed.\n\nXinhua, China's state news agency, reported in March that Shanghai has 16 private museums, most of which have faltered.\n\nThe Shihua Art Museum, which displayed a collection of ancient ceramic teapots, was forced to close this year after three years in operation. Zhao Yueting, the owner, had invested two million yuan after a developer promised five years' free rent. The landlord later changed his mind.\n\n\"I have been collecting ancient Chinese ceramics for nearly two decades, and some of them could be called national treasures,\"Mr Zhao told Xinhua.\"I hoped more people could enjoy the beauty of these ancient works of art.\"\n\nIn China where commercial and cultural interests often overlap, museums are prized by property developers eager to give their shopping malls and residential developments a high-brow gloss.\n\nOften they are little more than galleries, where the art on the walls is for sale. \n\n\"A museum needs a level of intellectuality. It is then it can offer a good service to the community,\"says Wang Huangsheng, a Chinese critic and curator and a former director of the Guangdong Museum of Art.\n\nCultural dynasties\n\nLars Nittve, a founding director of the Tate Modern in London, says the flurry of museum building in Asia is reminiscent of periods in Western history when affluent patrons of the arts built museums that are today feted worldwide.\n\n\"There was a need to understand society and culture and how it developed,\"says Mr Nittve, who is now in charge of a publicly- funded project to develop a contemporary art museum in Hong Kong.\n\nIn late 19th century Britain, sugar merchant Henry Tate helped construct a building to house his collection of Victorian art that he donated to the country, a move that ultimately lead to the network of museums that bear his name.\n\nAnd in the US, powerful business families like the Rockefellers, Gettys and Guggenheims cemented their position as cultural dynasties by funding museums.\n\nThe burgeoning of private museums in Asia also appears to be having a positive effect on governments, at least in China, where a large number of public museums are under construction and some provinces and cities offer incentives and tax breaks for those taking the private route.\n\nPassing on\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for the private museums owners and directors attending the Hong Kong forum was what would happen to the museums and the artwork once their deep-pocketed founders were gone.\n\n\"In China we have a short history with respect to the museum system, this means we are still short of management and other skills to carry on the museums to the next generation,\"says Mr Wang.\n\nFor Li Bing, the owner of Beijing He Jing Yuan Art Museum, this is a  big challenge. He said his daughter is not interested in learning about art and museums.\n\n\"Her enthusiasm is not like mine,\"he says.\"I need to find someone who can inherit the management.\"\n\nMr Oei will hand the running of his museum in Indonesia to his daughter-in-law and is confident that his sons, also successful businessmen, won't as he puts it\"sell the artwork for luxury cars\". \n\nTo sustain it over the long term, however, he says public funding is needed.\n\nOf course, even with the best of intentions many of the institutions being set up today won't last long, but, if a handful are able to replicate the success of the Tate or the Guggenheim, Asia's cultural landscape will be all the richer.\nTL;DR: Among the new shiny shopping malls and upscale residential high rises that are the most visible hallmarks of Asia's economic boom, museums are springing up.\n\nArticle: It happened at 10:00 GMT on Birchfields Road in Longsight. \n\nGreater Manchester Fire & Rescue Service said the driver suffered only minor injuries when the 70ft (20m) tree crashed on to his windscreen.\n\nIn Barton Square, Trafford Park, a man suffered spinal injuries after being reportedly struck by falling roofing. \n\nHe was taken to Salford Royal Hospital, three other people suffered minor injuries. \n\nElsewhere, a lorry overturned on the M60 Barton Bridge near the Trafford Centre. \n\nTwo lanes were closed on the clockwise side between junctions 10 and 11.

deep, narrow valleys in the sea floor which can plunge down to almost 6.8 miles (11km).\n\nYet researchers believe there is great potential for discovering antibiotics in these extreme conditions.\n\nLife in these incredibly hostile environments is effectively cut off and has evolved differently in each trench.\n\nThe international team will use fishing vessels to drop sampling equipment on a reel of cables to the trench bed to collect sediment. \n\nScientists will then attempt to grow unique bacteria and fungi from the sediment that can be extracted and refined to discover new antibiotics.\n\nStarting in the autumn with the Atacama Trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean - about 100 miles (161km) off the coast of Chile and Peru - the EU-funded research will also search deep trenches off New Zealand as well waters off Antarctica.\n\nArctic waters off Norway will also be explored.\n\n'Pre-antibiotic era'\n\nThe inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics - and an over-reliance on the drugs - has led to a rapid increase in resistant bugs and medical experts fear effective antibiotics might soon run out completely.\n\nIn January, Chief Medical Officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, compared the threat to global warming and said going for a routine operation could become deadly due to the risk of untreatable infection.\n\nProject leader Marcel Jaspars, professor of chemistry at the University of Aberdeen, said:\"If nothing's done to combat this problem, we're going to be back to a'pre-antibiotic era' in around 10 or 20 years, where bugs and infections that are currently quite simple to treat could be fatal.\"\n\nHe said there had not been a\"completely new\"antibiotic registered since 2003 -\"partially because of a lack of interest by drugs companies as antibiotics are not particularly profitable\".\n\n\"The average person uses an antibiotic for only a few weeks and the drug itself only has around a five to 10-year lifespan, so the firms don't see much return on their investment.\"\n\nHe said he expected scientists to be working on samples in the laboratory within 18 months and added that, if new treatments were discovered, they could be available within a decade.\n\nProject co-ordinator Dr Camila Esguerra, from the University of Leuven in Belgium, said:\"We'll be testing many unique chemical compounds from these marine samples that have literally never seen the light of day. \n\n\"We're quite hopeful that we'll find a number of exciting new drug leads.\"\nTL;DR: Researchers are embarking on an \u00a38m project to discover new antibiotics at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nArticle: Mr Andrews wants Llanrumney High School to close this summer instead of August 2014.\n\nPupils are due to leave the school in September anyway and move to neighbouring Rumney High School.\n\nCardiff council plans to establish a new school for the east of the city next year.\n\nHowever, Mr Andrews said Cardiff council's timetable to officially close Llanrumney in August 2014 was\"too drawn out\".\n\nHe said:\"I will shortly be commencing a four week consultation period with a view to directing the authority to close Llanrumney High School effective of August 2013, allowing pupils to be fully integrated into Rumney High School from September.\"\n\nThe number of pupils at the school is falling and the standard of education it offers is\"unsatisfactory\", he said.\n\nLlanrumney was placed in special measures by inspectors in October last year.\n\nThe move by Mr Andrews follows concern about education standards in many parts of Wales.\n\nThis week schools inspectorate Estyn said education services in Merthyr Tydfil and Monmouthshire should be taken into special measures.\n\nThey are latest councils deemed to be failing pupils, following Anglesey, Blaenau Gwent and Pembrokeshire.\n\nA council spokesperson said:\"Cardiff council has today received notification that the Welsh Minister for Education Leighton Andrews has used his powers to begin a consultation regarding the closure of Llanrumney High School. \n\n\"We have already been in discussion with the minister's office and will of course engage fully in his consultation which is due to commence on 27 February.\"\nTL;DR: Education Minister Leighton Andrews is considering forcing Cardiff council to close a secondary school a year earlier than originally planned.\n\nArticle: The Mumbai Mirror reported that a stewardess accidentally turned it off while the two pilots took a break.\n\nAir India denied this but said cabin crew did\"overstay\"in the cockpit and that the autopilot was briefly disconnected\"due to distraction\".\n\nThe cabin crew and the pilot had been suspended pending an inquiry, it added.\n\nThe Mumbai Mirror reported on Friday that the incident took place on an Airbus 321 flying from Bangkok to Delhi on 12 April.\n\nCiting an unnamed source in Air India, it said the two pilots had taken a 40-minute break from the cockpit and left two stewardesses in their seats to operate the plane in their absence.\n\nOne of the stewardesses accidentally turned off the auto-pilot, forcing the pilots to rush back to their seats, the report said.\n\n'Summoned'\n\nHowever, in an email to the BBC, an Air India spokesman said:\"It is categorically stated that at no point of time the cockpit was left unattended by the cockpit crew.\n\n\"Based on a report that two cabin crew members were in the cockpit for a prolonged period on the flight, the airline management... summoned the cockpit and cabin crew for an enquiry.\n\n\"As the enquiry confirmed the overstay of the cabin crew in the cockpit, administrative action was taken against them and the pilot.

There is a real climate of fear in Sri Lanka, with those brave enough to speak out against the government often having to suffer badly for it.\"\n\nIt said that human rights violations must end before Colombo is allowed to go ahead with hosting the meeting. \n\nThe Sri Lankan High Commission in London rejected the group's allegations, saying that a rehabilitation process is under way after years of conflict. \n\nSri Lanka's army defeated Tamil rebels after a brutal 26-year war in 2009.  The entire conflict left at least 100,000 people dead.\n\nBoth sides were accused of human rights abuses throughout the conflict, with much focus on what happened in its final stages, when thousands of civilians were trapped in a thin strip of land in the north of Sri Lanka as fighting raged around them.\n\nEstimates of civilian deaths in the final months range widely from 9,000 to 75,000.\n\nLast month the UN's Human Rights Council passed a resolution highly critical of Sri Lanka's record.\n\nThe resolution encouraged Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and credible investigation into alleged war crimes.\nTL;DR: Amnesty International has accused Sri Lanka of intensifying a crackdown on dissent and urged the Commonwealth not to hold its summit there unless the human rights situation improves.\n\nArticle: By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website in Chicago\n\nThe disease is so hard to treat that survival rates have barely changed for decades.\n\nBut data, presented at the world's biggest cancer conference, showed long-term survival could be increased from 16% to 29%.\n\nThe findings have been described as a\"major win\",\"incredibly exciting\"and as offering new hope to patients.\n\nPancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly cancers, with patients often given just months to live after diagnosis. \n\nIt is aggressive, resists treatment and, because pancreatic tumours cause nondescript symptoms, is often found only after it has spread throughout the body.\n\nIn the UK alone, 9,400 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 8,800 die from the disease each year. \n\nDouble team\n\nThe trial on 732 patients - in hospitals in the UK, Sweden, France and Germany - compared the standard chemotherapy drug gemcitabine against a combination of gemcitabine and capecitabine.\n\nThe results, released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference, showed that average survival times increased from 25 to 28 months.\n\nBut there was a far more dramatic impact on long-term survival with 29% of patients alive for at least five years with combination therapy compared with 16% normally. \n\nThere was no difference in side-effects.\n\nProf John Neoptolemos, from the University of Liverpool, who led the study, said:\"This important trial shows that this drug combination could give pancreatic patients valuable extra months and even years and so will become the new treatment for patients with this disease.\n\n\"The difference in short-term survival may seem modest but improvement in long-term survival is substantial for this cancer.\n\n\"This drug combination will become the new standard of care for patients with the disease.\"\n\nIt is not entirely clear why there is the difference in survival rates, but one idea surrounds the new drug being less toxic allowing patients to tolerate higher doses.\n\n'Exciting'\n\nAlex Ford, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK, said:\"These are incredibly exciting results from a major trial for those diagnosed with this dreadful disease. \n\n\"The outlook for pancreatic cancer has been grim. With few treatment options, survival rates have barely changed in 40 years in the UK. Currently just 5% of pancreatic cancer patients can expect to live for five years. \n\n\"At the same time, incidence is set to soar by a third to more than 12,000 people being diagnosed every year by 2030.\n\n\"The possibility of increasing survival for those who have undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer will give great hope to hundreds of patients and their families who may benefit. The importance of clinical trials to help transform the outlook for pancreatic cancer cannot be over-estimated.\n\n\"We now need to see these results quickly translate to a change in approach by clinicians so that patients start to benefit more widely straightaway.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the charity Cancer Research UK.\n\nIts chief clinician Prof Peter Johnson said:\"Pancreatic cancer remains a very difficult disease to find and treat. \n\n\"Despite this, we are making steady progress, through trials like this one, where the use of better chemotherapy after surgery was able to increase the number of people surviving the disease.\"\n\nAround 340,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year with the highest incidence in North America and Europe. \n\nDr Smitha Krishnamurthi, from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said:\"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most hard-to-treat cancers. \n\n\"It is a major win to find that adding a generic chemotherapy not only improves survival for these patients, but does so with little effect on patients' quality of life.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.\nTL;DR: A new combination of chemotherapy drugs should become the main therapy for pancreatic cancer, say UK researchers.\n\nArticle: By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent\n\nIt has accepted measures put forward by officials to prevent pollution in rivers, lakes and groundwater from agriculture.\n\nJust over a third of 450 rivers in Northern Ireland are classified as having a status of good or better.\n\nFarming and industry are often cited as significant causes of water quality issues. \n\nSeveral ideas originally suggested in the plan were dropped after opposition from farmers.\n\nThey included proposals requiring the covering of slurry stores and a ban on the use of certain fertilisers.\n\nThose will now be considered as part of separate plan to cut ammonia emissions linked to agriculture.\n\nOfficials must review Northern Ireland's so-called Nitrates Action Plan every four years. This is the fourth version.\n\nWhen it was put out to public consultation in March, the main farmers' union said\"bolting on\"measures to deal with ammonia emissions was\"nonsensical and counterproductive\".\n\nThe Ulster Farmers' Union said they would be better dealt with under the ammonia plan.\n\n'Pragmatic approach'\n\nThey also said the cost associated with covering new outdoor slurry stores by January next year, and existing ones by 2022, was\"unworkable\"and would add cost that would be detrimental to businesses.\n\nAs part of its approval, the EU has also signed off on a relaxation of the rules that allows some farmers to maintain cattle numbers if they fulfil certain criteria.\n\nThat derogation will run from now to 2022.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said the changes to the plan after public consultation represented a\"pragmatic and workable approach\".\n\nThe spokesperson said it struck a balance between the needs of the environment, the need to comply with its legal requirements and the need to support the agri-food industry.\n\nAnother of the changes will double the threshold for the size of cattle and pig farms that must use specialist slurry spreading equipment to cut emissions.\nTL;DR: The EU has given its re-approval for plans to protect water quality in Northern Ireland.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent\n\nUKSA is giving over \u00a31m to seven firms to help advance novel sensor technologies and the smart algorithms needed to interpret their data.\n\nFinding better ways to surveil objects moving overhead has become a high priority issue.\n\nWith more and more satellites being launched, there's growing concern about the potential for collisions.\n\nA big worry is the burgeoning population of redundant hardware and junk in orbit - some 900,000 objects larger than 1cm by some counts, and all of it capable of doing immense damage to, or even destroying, an operational spacecraft in a high-velocity encounter.\n\nThe projects being supported by UKSA come from a mix of start-ups and more established companies.\n\nThe overriding goal is to improve ways to spot, characterise and track objects. \n\nUltimately, this is information which could be fed into the automated traffic management systems of the future that will keep functioning satellites out of harm's way.     \n\nThe funded projects include:\n\n\"We've known for a long while that the space environment is getting more difficult, more cluttered,\"said Jacob Geer from UKSA.\"Space surveillance and tracking is one of the key things we can do to keep safe those satellites we rely on now, and to make sure certain orbits don't become inaccessible for future generations because there's too much debris in them.\n\n\"We had 26 proposals come to us and I think we've selected a good cross-section of ideas in the seven companies we're supporting,\"he told BBC News.\n\nWhile a lot of these projects are still at the lab stage, D-Orbit's work is dedicated to pushing the capability of some of its hardware already in space. \n\nThe company recently launched a vehicle to carry and deploy a clutch of small satellites. This vehicle uses cameras to photograph its surroundings and to map the stars for the purposes of navigation. \n\nD-Orbit has the idea of using the cameras' imagery to also identify passing junk.\n\n\"One of the challenges in using star trackers is filtering out objects that are not supposed to be there - obviously, because you're trying to compare what you can see against a star catalogue,\"explained D-Orbit's Simon Reid.\"And, of course, it's those extra objects which in principal are the things that are potentially debris.\"\n\nThe funding announcement also coincides with the signing of a new partnership agreement between the Ministry of Defence and UKSA to work together on space domain awareness. \n\nBoth have valuable assets and interests in orbit that need protecting. And for the UK taxpayer, this investment was recently deepened with the purchase out of bankruptcy of the OneWeb satellite broadband company. \n\nThe UK government is now the part owner of one of the biggest spacecraft networks in the sky. OneWeb has so far launched 74 satellites in its communications constellation, with plans to put up thousands more.\n\nBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma said:\"Millions of pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth present a significant threat to UK satellite systems which provide the vital services that we all take for granted - from mobile communications to weather forecasting. \n\n\"By developing new AI and sensor technology, the seven pioneering space projects we are backing today will significantly strengthen the UK's capabilities to monitor these hazardous space objects, helping to create new jobs and protect the services we rely on in our everyday lives.\"\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: New approaches to tracking satellites and debris in orbit are to get a boost from the UK Space Agency.\n\nArticle: The 29ft-high (8.8m) frame - which was to have been used in the construction of a concrete wall at Goval - toppled over last week.

The UN expressed concern at the plan on Tuesday, while Amnesty International called it a death blow to the right to seek asylum. \n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said the proposal to send migrants back would contravene international law.\n\nTalks between the EU and Turkey will continue ahead of an EU meeting next week.\n\nWhat's in the EU-Turkey proposal?\n\nThe EU heads said\"bold moves\"were needed, and made the following proposals:\n\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.\nTL;DR: Macedonia has said it will no longer let any migrants through its border with Greece, effectively blocking the Balkan route north.\n\nArticle: Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron Twitter\n\nOn Tuesday Democrat Jon Ossoff came close to beating Republican Karen Handel in a Georgia congressional district that has been historically conservative but trending left. In the words of the immortal Ricky Bobby of Talladega Nights, however,\"If you're not first, you're last\".\n\nThere have been four congressional special elections this year where Democrats and Republicans have gone head-to-head, and the Democrats have been\"not first\"in all of them. That prompted Donald Trump to take a Twitter victory lap on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Well, the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O!\"he wrote.\"All the Fake News, all the money spent = 0\".\n\nThe president's math is a bit off, of course. He's probably counting the Georgia primary, in which Mr Ossoff finished first, as a\"win\"and ignoring a California congressional election where no Republicans made it to the final round of balloting. \n\nNevertheless Georgia's result has to be considered a demoralising blow to Democrats nationwide, who may be wondering if they'll ever be able to break through against a president whose low approval ratings, in their view, should make him, and his entire party, toxic. \n\nHere's a closer look at what it all means - and where both parties go from here.\n\nRepublicans win key Georgia election\n\nThe importance of Georgia\n\nThe battle of Gettysburg was important not because the tiny Pennsylvania town had any strategic significance. It was the turning point of the US Civil War because that's where the two armies decided to fight.\n\nA similar dynamic was at play in Georgia over the past few months. Democrats and Republicans made the Atlanta-area congressional district a pivotal battleground because both sides committed unprecedented resources to the effort. Mr Ossoff raised tens of millions from donors across the US, and the Democratic Party added hundreds of thousands of dollars from its campaign coffers.\n\nRepublican outside political groups and deep-pocketed donors, like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, also poured money into the race.\n\nEven though the Georgia seat is just one of 435 that will be up for grabs again next November the race became pivotal because both sides acted like it was.\n\nWhat it means for the Democrats\n\nStrategic concerns. Cue the circular firing squad. Already Democrats are questioning whether Mr Ossoff ran too cautious a race. Although he was the darling of the Democratic base - drawing on the same passionate small-money donors as populist Bernie Sanders in his presidential bid last year - he ran as a moderate, emphasising fiscal responsibility,\"humility\"and modest reforms of the current healthcare system, rather than the more sweeping liberal policies advocated by many on the left. The loss here is already starting to rekindle some of the Clinton v Sanders acrimony from last year's Democratic primary.\n\nPelosi questioned. The long knives are also starting to come out for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who some Democrats view as an ill-suited leader for the party. Republicans repeatedly hit Mr Ossoff for his supposed ties to the San Francisco liberal who has become a bogeywoman for conservatives, and on Wednesday one Democratic congressional hopeful announced his candidacy with the promise to support someone other than Ms Pelosi if he's elected.\n\nDollars at risk. Mr Ossoff's disappointing finish despite his record fundraising haul could also discourage future Democratic donors, left wondering whether their contributions have been well-spent. The Democrats' $23m war chest would have gone a long way to help candidates across the nation in next November's mid-term elections. They better hope there's more where that came from.\n\nWarm bodies in demand. One of the keys to a successful mid-term election is putting as many seats in play as possible by recruiting capable, compelling candidates. Congressman Ossoff would have been a perfect poster boy to encourage other Democrats to take the plunge next year. If a 30-year-old former filmmaker can come from nowhere to win, why can't they? Now, however, it may be harder to get quality candidates to commit to the meatgrinder that is a modern US campaign.\n\nWhat it means for Republicans\n\nNon-toxic Trump. According to a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, Mr Trump's approval rating in Georgia's sixth congressional district stood at 35%. Despite the president's low popularity, Republicans turned out for their party's candidate in record numbers for a special election. While they may not love the president, they either continue to dislike Democrats more or see their cause as bigger than one man, even if that man is the supposed face of the party.\n\nAgenda back on track. If Ms Handel had lost on Tuesday Republicans would be running for their political lives. Members of Congress staring at close elections would likely bail on any legislation that could cost them votes, including efforts to enact relatively unpopular conservative healthcare reforms, which are entering their critical final stages, and the upcoming contentious fight over tax reform. \n\nRetirement parties delayed. One tell-tale sign that a party sees an electoral rout on the horizon is when its senior politicians start heading for the exits. The prospect of a cushy lobbying job or a life of honorary board memberships can seem preferable to defeat at the ballot box or the frustrations of minority-party status. If Mr Ossoff had prevailed, a lot of Republicans would have been facing some hard choices. Instead, there may be reason to stick it out. Although the closeness of the race means the Republican House majority is still at risk, the Georgia seat is one that would likely fall in a wave midterm election. \n\nA pleasant distraction. Mr Trump and the Republicans had been on the ropes of late, with a seemingly never-ending stream of stories about White House palace intrigue and unpleasant revelations from the ongoing investigations into possible Russian ties to the Trump campaign. Tuesday's win gives the party the opportunity to change the conversation, at least temporarily, and may give the media cause to reconsider whether all the eye-popping headlines and blockbuster scoops are really resonating outside the environs of the nation's capital.\n\nDemocratic silver linings\n\nThose on the left will note that the Georgia race, decided by just under 4%, marked a significant tightening over past few races, where incumbent Republican Tom Price often doubled his opponent's vote total. The Democrats there, it appears, are trending in the right direction\n\nIf the party faithful want some real encouragement, however, they should look to the congressional race in neighbouring South Carolina, which also took place on Tuesday.\n\nThe South Carolina seat, previously occupied by current White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, largely flew under the national radar, but the Republican margin of victory there turned out to be narrower than in Georgia. \n\nIn a midterm wave election that cuts against the incumbent party - which is what Democrats are hoping for next year - the challengers tend to benefit from motivated voters on their side and the apathy of their opponents. The bright spotlight and vast resources spent on Georgia prevented that from happening on Tuesday, but next November - when all 435 seats in the House are up for grabs - the races might end up looking a lot more like South Carolina's low-turnout affair. \n\nIf that's the case, there are plenty of places where political balance is a lot closer than South Carolina's, perhaps suggesting the seats could tip to the Democrats. \n\nTwo moral victories on Tuesday instead of one probably isn't much of a comfort to Democrats right now, but it's a place to start.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIt's going to be a long summer for Democrats, as the next chance for their party to post some - any - electoral wins won't come until November. At that point, the terrain becomes friendlier, as the big prizes will be governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey. \n\nWith higher expectations comes greater pressure, however. A loss in either of those races will turn Democratic discouragement into outright despair.\nTL;DR: A party can't build a governing majority with moral victories.\n\nArticle: Daisy Cooper, MP for St Albans, said the Batchwood centre could vaccinate about 14,000 people a week but had only received around 1,000 vaccines over the last few weeks.\n\nIt meant some people being called to have one could not book an appointment.\n\nThe government said vaccines were\"being distributed fairly\". \n\nThe GP practice-led vaccination centre at a former nightclub has delivered about 20,000 doses since the end of December and is currently immunising people in cohort six, those over 65 plus people between 16 and 65 with an underlying health condition.\n\nTwo weeks ago, health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock congratulated Club Batchwood for its\"fantastic efforts\"and for being one of the best-performing centres in Britain.\n\nLiberal Democrat MP, Ms Cooper, who is writing to the vaccines minister, said constituents had been asking why they could book an appointment in a centre 20 miles away, but not in their home town.\n\nShe said she wanted answers from the government about whether the issue was about supply or distribution.\n\n\"All I'm asking for is some transparency about when the vaccine is going to come and how much of it is there going to be, so people get a sense of when they are going to be able to get their jab and that helps people to plan,\"she said.\n\nDr Helen McAndrew, one of the joint clinical leads for the city's programme, said government media briefings about the roll out's success had raised\"patient expectation about the availability\".\n\nShe said appointments were not released until they knew there was supply but the shortage had\"rather limited the number of appointments we can deliver\".\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said:\"Vaccines are being distributed fairly across the UK to make sure the most vulnerable people in society are immunised first. Some parts of the country have made very significant progress and have gone slightly faster than the average.\n\n\"We're putting more supply into areas that have more to do and the rollout of vaccinations will continue to expand at pace as we work to offer a vaccine to all over-50s by mid-April.\"\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

I remember telling a friend,'I think my Dad's just died'.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, there was no treatment for a heart attack. If they survived, victims were confined to a hospital bed, given painkillers and told to take complete rest. \n\nIf they died in their 50s or 60s, like Robert's father, it was considered a fact of life.\n\nKnowledge of how the heart functions and how best to treat heart disease has improved dramatically over the past 50 years, says a new book written by the British Heart Foundation.\n\nIn 1961, there were 322,917 deaths from cardiovascular disease, accounting for nearly half of all deaths in the UK. Heart attacks and angina chest pain were common, but little understood.\n\nNearly 50 years later in 2009, UK deaths from CVD had fallen to 32%, a total of 180,626. Now the chances of having a heart attack are much less and surviving one is much more likely.\n\nThere is no mystery as to why. Smoking levels in the 1960s were high and consumption of foods loaded with saturated fats were the norm.\n\nIn half a century the average UK diet has improved and the number of smokers has declined sharply, although obesity rates continue to rise.\n\nBut it is advances in treating heart damage that have really altered the landscape of heart medicine.\n\nFifty years ago, heart attack victims would be lucky to be offered any treatment en route to hospital. Doctors could only cross their fingers that their patient would not go on to suffer a cardiac arrest.\n\nIf they did, their chances of survival were very low.\n\nIf they were lucky enough to be close to an operating theatre then a quick-thinking surgeon could open up their chest and massage the heart by hand to get it beating again.\n\nIt was only in the mid-1960s that the revolutionary procedure of administering regular compressions to the chest by leaning on the breastbone, not reaching inside the chest, was used to generate a heartbeat. \n\nThis simple procedure is now a basic part of first aid training.\n\nDefibrillators, a machine used to give the heart an electric shock, were in use in the 1960s, but they were extremely cumbersome.\n\nProfessor Brian Pentecost, a junior doctor at this time who later became medical director of the BHF in the 1990s, recalls his hospital's defibrillator:\"It was an enormous thing known as the Red Devil, about the size of a refrigerator. It had to be wheeled through the hospital, bells ringing.\"\n\nThe first mobile defibrillators used by ambulance crews to treat people in their homes weighed over 11 stones and had to be powered by two car batteries.\n\n\"By the seventies you could get a defibrillator the size of a small suitcase. We could fit them in all ambulances so it was as good as being in hospital,\"says Prof Pentecost.\n\n\"They made a major contribution to saving lives.\"\n\nOnce in hospital, heart patients were scattered inefficiently throughout the general wards.\n\nProfessor Desmond Julian, medical director of the BHF from 1987 to 1993, who started working in cardiology in the 1950s, saw that something had to change.\n\nHe set up the UK's first coronary care unit in Edinburgh in the 1960s in an effort to get heart patients admitted quickly, keep them monitored continuously and keep the right equipment and staff on standby.\n\nHis example was soon followed throughout the world.\n\nOnce experts agreed in the 1970s that blood clots in blood vessels were the cause of heart attacks - and not the other way round - medicine could begin to find the drugs to tackle the problem and develop techniques to improve blood flow to the heart.\n\nSo much so that when Robert had a heart attack in 2005, aged 43, his blocked up arteries were gently opened using tightly folded balloons passed into the right location via a catheter, a procedure called an angioplasty.\n\nFollowing the procedure, Robert was told to go home and stay active - not put his feet up.\n\nHe now swims three times a week and does at least two to three hours of salsa dancing and walking.\n\n\"I was lucky really. I only had minor damage to my heart. Like many people, I didn't know I'd had a heart attack.\n\n\"I went to my GP feeling awful, like I had flu. Even walking up stairs was hard work. \n\n\"He checked my pulse, gave me a blood test and an ECG then sent me home. Later I got a call telling me I had to go to hospital.\"\n\nProfessor Pentecost says there has been a complete change of emphasis when dealing with patients like Robert.\n\n\"Fifty years ago too many people were condemned to a life of inactivity. The treatment of angina has changed people's ability to enjoy life.\n\n\"Before, people were in bed so long they ended up with deep vein thrombosis and then got clots on the lungs.\"\n\nTaking drugs to control heart disease is now a standard and effective approach. \n\nOver one and a half million people currently living in the UK have had a heart attack. Over two million people have angina or heart failure.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation predicts that these numbers will increase as the population continues to age, making new approaches to treating heart damage very important.\n\nRobert takes daily doses of statins, beta blockers and aspirins for his heart and will do so for the rest of his life. These drugs give him, and countless thousands of others, a good quality of life - something his father was never lucky enough to enjoy.\n\n'50 Years at the Heart of Health, 1961-2011' is  published by the British Heart Foundation.

I feel that was my way of getting into the system.\"\n\nAll five of the English born, black or mixed-race players selected by England to tour South Africa this summer were at least partly educated in private schools.\n\nHarlequins prop Kyle Sinckler went to state schools until the age of 16, but moved to the fee-paying Epsom College shortly after the London club signed the tight-head to their academy. \n\nSinckler went on to make his full England debut in 2016 and has since won 13 caps for his country.\n\n\"You can't just hand out hundreds of scholarships all the time,\"Christian argues.\"There will only ever be a handful who can benefit from that.\n\n\"To get kids into private school you obviously need money, which not everybody has.

It serves approximately 1.5m people across the Red Rose county.\n\nChief Constable Steve Finnigan was honoured with a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in June 2010.\n\nHe heads up a force which is rated as one of the best performing in England and Wales. \n\nThe force has five other chief officers: Deputy Chief Constable Chris Weigh; three assistant chief constables - Mark Bates, Peter White and Andy Rhodes; and Director of Resources Ian Cosh.\n\nThe constabulary's headquarters is based in Hutton, Preston. \n\nThe force cites neighbourhood policing, diversity, quality, protecting people and value for money as its key issues.\n\nThe constabulary said partner organisations and working with the local community was critical to its success, particularly the Lancashire Neighbourhood Watch network which the force describes as a\"key partner\".  \n\nThe force is known for its mounted police division which celebrated its centenary year this year. It has 18 horses, all named after Lancashire towns. \n\nThe Lancashire Police Authority (LPA) has a stated aim to\"secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for their area\". \n\nThe LPA, which is made up of a panel of 17 members, will be wound up after the election.\n\nFunding\n\nThe force gets a total of \u00a3105.7m grant from central government for the year. \n\nFollowing the government's budget cuts to police in England and Wales following the spending review, the Lancashire force has had to make savings of \u00a342.7m.\n\nIt has already made cuts of \u00a333m and accounted for savings of \u00a340m, meaning the force has \u00a32.7m to lose before 31 March 2015.\n\nThere were 3,659 police officer posts when the spending review was announced, and there will be 537 fewer police officer posts by the 2015 deadline.  \n\nThis year's council tax precept - the amount of money which each household pays towards the area's policing - is \u00a3149.93 for a Band D property, which amounts to a 3% rise following last year's freeze. It is higher than neighbouring force Greater Manchester (\u00a3144.33) but just below Merseyside (\u00a3150.62).\n\nCrime and performance\n\nThere has been a drop in robberies, racially-motivated crimes and burglaries compared with the previous year. \n\nHowever, figures comparing April 2011 with March 2012 showed a rise of nearly 6% in the number of people being injured through violence. \n\nMr Finnigan praised the organisation's\"dedication\"and\"commitment\"amid challenges caused by budget cuts.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nLancashire Constabulary\n\nLancashire Police Authority\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioner\n\nElectoral Commission\n\nPCC: Home Office\nTL;DR: On 15 November 37 police and crime commissioners will be elected in England along with four in Wales.\n\nArticle: By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website\n\nThe infection, which causes symptoms including mild fever, conjunctivitis and headache, has already been found in 21 countries in the Caribbean, North and South America. \n\nIt has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains and some countries have advised women not to get pregnant.\n\nNo treatment or vaccine is available.\n\nThe virus was first detected in 1947 in monkeys in Africa.

Benjamin Myers QC, told the jury at Preston Crown Court:\"We don't call Mr Duckenfield to give evidence.\"\n\nThe 74-year-old is on trial alongside Graham Mackrell, 69, the former club secretary at Sheffield Wednesday, who is accused of a safety offence.\n\nBoth men deny the charges. \n\nThe trial follows a crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace during the 1989 Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final.\n\n'Open the gates'\n\nBenjamin Myers QC called statements from Bernard Murray, who was the retired chief superintendent's deputy on the day and has since died.\n\nIn a statement made on 2 May 1989, Mr Murray said the plan for policing the match was the same one adopted in 1988 when the same teams met at the same venue.\n\nAt that game the match commander was Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, but he had been moved just weeks before the 1989 game and replaced by Mr Duckenfield.\n\nA reduction by 10% in the numbers of officers on duty at the game was agreed during a series of pre-match meetings attended by senior ranks.\n\nAt a meeting with Mr Mole, a request to switch ends of the ground, so Liverpool fans were given the Kop end, was rejected.\n\nOn the day of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield gave all those on duty a briefing before they went to the control room ahead of the game.\n\nBy 14:30, Mr Murray's statement said there was a\"large crowd\"outside the Leppings Lane turnstile but he\"remarked\"to his boss that they still had time to\"get them in\".\n\nThey agreed kick-off would only be delayed if there was an\"identifiable problem\"such as congestion on the motorway approach to the city or bad weather.\n\nMr Murray's statement said officers became\"exasperated\"at the poor communications as the radios were not working properly, and at 14:45 the first request came in to\"open the gates\"to relieve crush pressure at the turnstiles.\n\nAs more requests came in to open the gates, Mr Murray's statement continued:\"I turned around to Chief Supt Duckenfield and said,'Mr Duckenfield, are you going to open the gates?'\n\n\"He replied,'Open the gates.\"'\n\nThe jury was then told of Mr Murray's evidence to the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster.\n\nAt that time he was asked where he thought all the fans being let in were going to go.\n\nHe replied:\"I never considered where they were all going to go.\"\n\nMr Murray told the inquiry he never checked the readily available turnstile numbers, to see how many fans still had to enter the Leppings Lane terrace, and he did not appreciate they would go down the tunnel leading directly to the central pens.\n\nThe defence case for Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield concluded, one hour and 14 minutes after it began.\n\n'Entirely

for Mr Mackrell on a charge of contravening the stadium's safety certificate due to\"insufficient evidence\".\n\nThe 69-year-old remains on trial charged with failing to discharge a duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act.\n\nThe jury heard eight character references for Mr Mackrell, including statements from Roy Hattersley, the Sheffield-born former Labour MP and former manager of Sheffield Wednesday, Howard Wilkinson, who worked with Mr Mackrell between 1983 and 1988.\n\nHis statement read:\"In relation to administrative matters, Graham's work was always of a high standard.\n\n\"He worked hard, was self-motivated and brought a professional quality to his role.\n\n\"I found him to be entirely dependable, highly regarded by the board of directors.\n\n\"In all respects I found Graham to be competent, proficient and trustworthy.\"\n\nUnder the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day

Reduced immigration today means reduced emigration in a year or two's time, which could see net migration rise again.\"\n\nThe figures come on the same day the Chief Inspector of Borders John Vine warned that thousands of overseas students may have been allowed to stay in Britain illegally because UK Border Agency staff failed to check out tip-offs about them - a backlog of 153,000 had built up at one point, he said.\nTL;DR: Net migration levels to the UK have fallen significantly in the past year, official estimates have indicated.\n\nArticle: The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which manages five homes connected to the world-renowned playwright, said it is only his home that will reopen on 1 August, thanks to a \u00a3900,000 grant.\n\nThe remainder will stay shut until 2021, while the trust hopes to access cash from the government's \u00a31.57bn arts support package.\n\nA restructuring process of 240 employees is currently under way.\n\n\"We are a charity and we need to look at the best way to use our limited resources,\"Rachael O'Connor Boyd, director of visitor experience and business development, said.\n\n\"But we're also conscious of what we bring and the stories that we tell and the birthplace is an iconic place for the nation and a very important place for Stratford.\"\n\nThe trust, which closed as the lockdown was brought in, expected to bring in \u00a310m this year.

Much of this change was down to a move away from coal as an energy source. \n\n\"An emerging discussion pre-2020 was whether global fossil CO2 emissions were showing signs of peaking,\"said Glen Peters, research director at CICERO.\n\n\"Covid-19 has changed this narrative to one that involves avoiding a rebound in emissions and asking if emissions have already peaked,\"he said.\n\nAll the researchers involved in this project agree that a rebound of emissions in 2021 is almost certain. \n\nTo minimise the uptick in carbon, the scientists are urging a\"green\"rather than a\"brown\"response, meaning recovery funding should be spent on sustainable projects and not on fossil fuels. \n\nThey argue that efforts should also be made to boost walking and cycling in cities and to rapidly deploy electric vehicles.\n\nWhile 2020's fall of over two billion tonnes of CO2 is welcome, the scientists say that meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement will need cuts of up to two billion tonnes every year for the next decade. \n\n\"Although global emissions were not as high as last year, they still amounted to about 39 billion tonnes of CO2, and inevitably led to a further increase in CO2 in the atmosphere,\"said lead researcher Prof Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter, UK.\n\n\"The atmospheric CO2 level, and consequently the world's climate, will only stabilise when global CO2 emissions are near zero.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Earth System Science Data.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nTL;DR: The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic has driven the biggest annual fall in CO2 emissions since World War Two, say researchers.\n\nArticle: Large shops and supermarkets must remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from view by December this year. Smaller shops must comply by April 2015. \n\nHealth Minister Lesley Griffiths said the ban would protect children from the harm caused by smoking.\n\nAnti-smoking group Ash said it was a\"significant step\".\n\nRetailers will be able to display one price list at the point of sale and an illustrated price list will also be available to customers on request.\n\nThe list will not be left out on display.\n\n'Death'\n\nMs Griffiths said:\"Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of illness, disability and premature death in Wales and accounts for more than 5,600 deaths every year. \n\n\"Evidence shows the display of tobacco products in shops can promote smoking by young people and undermine the resolve of adult smokers who are trying to quit.\"\n\nThe Welsh government's aim is to reduce adult smoking rates to 16% by 2020. \n\nAsh chief executive Elen de Lacy said:\"Research after point of sale displays had been banned in Ireland showed that compliance was high among retailers, young people became less confident that they would be able to purchase cigarettes from shops, and were less able to recall brands, with a drop from 80% to 22% after it was implemented.\"\nTL;DR: Cigarettes will be banned from display in stores in Wales, it has been announced.\n\nArticle: January 1967 \n\nNorth Korean artillery targets a South Korean vessel, the Dangpo, patrolling in the Yellow Sea with 70 sailors on board.
