Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining a two-meter distance, and household members can go out together. Shielding support will continue for those who need it, including food and medicine deliveries. The changes apply to England, while advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet been updated. The move has sparked concerns from scientists who fear that the relaxation of lockdown rules may increase the spread of the virus, particularly with infection rates remaining high. Despite this, the UK's Deputy Chief Medical Officer has urged the public to be \"sensible and proportionate\" with their new freedoms. Thousands of people with MS, who were previously shielded, have expressed concerns about the sudden change in advice, calling for more information on the scientific evidence behind the decision.  The changes aim to fine-tune the shielding advice based on what is now known about the virus, with some scientists suggesting that the list of those at high risk may be reviewed in the future. \n\n(Note: I made some minor adjustments to ensure that the summary is not too long and maintain its fluency.)

They believe the animals can be more reliable than snowmobiles, which can break down.\n\nSummary:\nRussia's Interior Ministry is exploring the use of reindeer as a transportation option for police in the Yamalo-Nenets region of northwest Siberia. The region's difficult terrain makes it challenging for snowmobiles to operate reliably, and police sometimes struggle to locate suspects or transport people back to the police station. The idea of using reindeer is based on the fact that they can move independently and are less likely to break down, unlike snowmobiles. This concept is not new, as Russia's Defence Ministry already has a program that utilizes donkeys and mules in mountain brigades. The use of reindeer as a police transport option is being considered, with legislation in place to support it. \n\nNote: The original article provides more context and background information, but the summary aims to condense the main points into a concise and readable form while maintaining accuracy and coherence.

Seven national academies have urged the government to protect research funding in Brexit negotiations. UK researchers are already experiencing difficulties in securing EU funding, with some applications being rejected due to concerns over UK involvement. Small businesses, such as Archer Technicoat, which develops coatings for rocket thrusters, have seen their EU funding dry up since the referendum. Experts warn that the UK's reputation as a hub for research and innovation is at risk, with some researchers feeling \"frozen out\" of large-scale projects. If the UK is no longer seen as a viable partner for research, it may lose out on big discoveries and collaborations, ultimately harming its future prosperity.

The messages, which included Mackay calling the boy \"cute\", have been published by the Scottish Sun. Mackay apologized, saying he had \"behaved foolishly\", and took full responsibility for his actions. He also apologized to the boy and his family. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suspended Mackay from the SNP, and police are assessing the situation. The boy's family has called for Mackay to be removed from his position. Mackay's resignation came as a surprise, given his potential to become the next First Minister. He had been a key member of the Scottish cabinet and was known for his work on finance and the economy. The incident has raised concerns about Mackay's behavior, with some accusing him of \"grooming\" the boy.

The college, which earned A$57m in government funding for enrolling over 3,600 students in 2014-2015, is alleged to have targeted vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal communities and people with disabilities. Sales agents went door-to-door, offering free laptops as an incentive to sign up for online courses. Students were not informed about the course or the college, and were not made aware of their liability for up to A$25,000 in debt repayments under the VET FEE-HELP scheme. The ACCC and NSW Fair Trading have filed a claim in federal court, seeking repayment of the government funding and an end to the college's alleged deceptive practices. The watchdog has criticized the college for its \"unconscionable\" conduct, emphasizing the importance of transparency in higher education. \n\n(Note: This summary is concise and captures the main points of the article while maintaining coherence and readability.

Whenever something comes up in forensics he's the man to explain it best; we're lucky to have him there.\n\n\"And then for the attacks I can explain it better.\n\n\"We always got along, but I don't think John appreciated much of what I did.\"\n\nDet Sgt Atkin has\"no problem\"meeting the hackers he's arrested because the whole point of the police Cyber Futures programme is to\"try and develop people\".\n\n\"What you can see here is that by working with Cameron and his family, and providing the support and knowledge we have, we're able to deliver and put him in a place where his future is set, rather than where he could have been.\n\n\"Cameron's a good kid so he's doing really well; the future's bright for him.

With a projected annual cost of \u00a32.3m, the facility aims to reduce harm for users and communities, and prevent drug-related infections.

The proposal for the safe injecting facility was agreed by the city's Health and Social Care Partnership and has been described as \"ambitious and innovative\" by Scottish ministers. The facility's designers aim to cut public injecting, reduce harm for users and communities, and prevent increases in drug-related infections.

The society aims to enhance the area, possibly creating an open-air auditorium, and believes it could become a significant tourist attraction. A petition has been initiated to halt the sale, urging the council to develop the property into a tourist venue, citing its underutilization and potential revenue generation for Lincoln. The council will consider the petition if it reaches 900 signatures before September 5th. The sale follows a previous attempt two years ago, which was rejected due to a lack of synergy between the bidder and the council's vision. The Sir Joseph Banks Society is working with several organizations to explore possible uses for The Lawn. A council spokesman stated that a relevant senior officer will give evidence at a Policy Scrutiny Committee meeting if the petition reaches 450 signatures. The council's decision to sell The Lawn is aimed at saving money, but the potential buyers see it as an opportunity to transform the area and make it more profitable.

Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.  However, younger trees (10-30 years old) are at greater risk and can succumb to the disease in just a few years.\n\nDrs Straw and Williams described BCD as a\"much more serious threat\"because the\"rate at which the disease has spread through the horse chestnut populations has shown no sign of slowing down in recent years, and it is still too early to say how many trees will be killed eventually and how many might survive\".\n\nContrary to the opinion that trees with foliage damage caused by leaf miners would be more susceptible to BCD and help accelerate its spread, Dr Straw said the decade-long study did not support such a view.\n\n\"Trees that have heavily damage foliage by the leaf miner do not get the (bleeding canker) disease more often and they do not suffer from it any more severely so we cannot see that the impact of the leaf miner is causing sufficient stress in the trees to make them more susceptible to the disease,\"he explained. \n\n\"The two organisms seem to be operating independently.\"\n\nDr Straw said Forest Research scientists had been concerned by attempts to treat horse chestnut trees with insecticides in order to curb the spread of leaf miners.\n\n\"This was based on the argument that by controlling the moth you would help stop the trees from becoming infected with bleeding canker disease,\"he added. \n\n\"What we have shown is that there is no point doing that.

Originating from a single female crayfish with a genetic mutation in the 1990s, they can now be found in multiple countries, including Japan, Madagascar, and the US.

Researchers have noted that environmental influences may shape the crayfish's coloration, but their ability to adapt and multiply remains a concern. The study's findings have implications for understanding cancer tumor development and resistance to drug treatments.
