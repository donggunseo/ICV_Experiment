The Fallago Rig wind farm has already created jobs and invested in the local economy, with estimates suggesting it meets the energy needs of up to 86,000 homes. The decision to reject the expansion plan follows a lengthy campaign against the project by local residents and environmental groups.

Despite China's warnings against pursuing independence, Tsai has emphasized the need for \"mutually acceptable\" interactions with Beijing and vowed not to \"harm the stability of cross-strait relations.\" Her party's pro-independence stance has been met with Chinese media criticism, but analysts suggest that her rhetoric has hardened since her election victory. Tsai has set up a task force to oversee the transfer of power, Taiwan's third democratic transition. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has congratulated Tsai on her win, describing Taiwan as an \"old friend.\" Meanwhile, Chinese state media has urged Taiwan to abandon its \"hallucination\" of independence, suggesting that Tsai's victory was more a result of the incumbent leader's performance rather than her own platform.

Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed.\n\nIn England, those shielding will be advised that they can go outside once a day, with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance. \n\nIn Wales, outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited. \n\nThose shielding should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes.\n\nAround 2.5 million UK people were advised to stay at home as lockdown began, because they were identified as being at particularly high risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms.\n\nMost were notified by their GP.\n\nThe list of people who should be shielding includes solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma.\n\nSome people shielding to be allowed outdoors\n\nNot all elderly people were asked to shield.\n\nSome were later removed from the shielding list if they no longer met the requirements.\n\nOne of the scientists advising the government, Professor Peter Openshaw, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that we are learning more about the virus:\"I think we're going to be able to fine-tune the advice now and actually reassure some people we feared might be susceptible, that in fact they're not as vulnerable as we thought.\"\n\nShielding has become'more challenging'\n\nLynne Loomes, a primary school teacher from Gloucestershire, is one of those who has had to stay inside having been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year.\n\nShe told BBC Breakfast that the easing of lockdown measures has made shielding more challenging - especially since she has had to tell her children they cannot go out for socially-distanced meet ups with friends.\n\n\"I'm having to say'no, you can't, because that increases the risk for me',\"she said.\n\n\"In terms of day-to-day we've tried to get up as normal.

However, her conviction was overturned, and she was due to face a second trial. Instead, she was sentenced to nine years and four months for manslaughter, which she will serve time for due to the time already served. Challen expressed gratitude to her family for their support during her imprisonment and acknowledged her husband's emotional abuse. Her conviction was overturned after a psychiatric report concluded she suffered from an \"adjustment disorder\" due to her husband's controlling behavior, including serial infidelity. Challen's sons have stated their support for their mother, noting that she does not deserve further punishment. The case highlights the issue of coercive control, a pattern of behavior that can lead to harm, punishment, or fear. Challen's case was influenced by the introduction of coercive control as a criminal offense in England and Wales in 2015. The family has finally found some closure after nine years of suffering.<|eot_id|>",

            "prediction": "Scientists in the UK say they are losing out on funding and collaboration opportunities since the Brexit vote.\n\nSummary:\nThe Brexit vote has led to concerns among UK researchers that they are being \"frozen out\" of European research projects and grants. Since the vote, UK applicants for grants have reportedly lost out, with some collaborators expressing concerns that a UK institution's involvement in a project would harm its chances. Small businesses and researchers have also seen their European funding stop or dry up, with many saying they are having to scale back operations and lay off staff. The UK's reputation as a place for doing research is also under threat, with some fearing that the country's image is already \"tarnished.\" Experts warn that the future prosperity of the UK is at stake, and seven national academies have called on the government to ensure research is protected in Brexit negotiations.  Key figures in the field, including the President of the Royal Society, have spoken out about the risks of Brexit to the UK's research sector.  British universities receive \u00a3850m in research grants each year from the European Union. \n\nNote: The TL;DR provided in the original article is used to create a concise summary, but it is not a direct summary of the article.

            "prediction": "A security breach of the adult dating site Adult Friend Finder has exposed the details of 412 million users, making it one of the largest data leaks ever.\n\nNow, here's a summary following the provided guidelines:\n\nA significant security breach has been reported at Adult Friend Finder (AFF), a dating site operated by Friend Finder Networks. The incident, which covers 20 years of sign-ins, including deleted accounts, may have exposed 412 million user records. The site's operator has initiated an investigation, but its parent company owns other explicit webcam sites whose logins are also believed to have been stolen. Leaked Source, a firm that provides data breach notifications, has reported the breach, citing it as the largest data leak they have seen. Security experts have confirmed the breach, but its scale is still being assessed, with some questioning the accuracy of the 412 million figure. The breach includes information from 5,650 government addresses and 78,301 US military addresses, highlighting the potential risks associated with sensitive data being compromised. The site's operator has not confirmed whether there was a breach, but has taken steps to investigate and secure the situation. The breach is being compared to the 2016 Yahoo data breach, which exposed data about 500 million users. Security experts warn that users who have used their work email addresses to create accounts may face difficulties as a result of the breach. The incident highlights the importance of securing sensitive data and the potential consequences of not doing so. The parent company of AFF owns other explicit sites, whose logins may also have been compromised in the breach. The investigation is ongoing, and users are advised to remain vigilant and check if their email addresses have been compromised. The breach is a significant concern, given the sensitive nature of the information compromised and the potential risks associated with it. The full extent of the breach is still being assessed, but it is clear that it is a major incident that has significant implications for users. The company's parent, which owns other explicit webcam sites, may also be vulnerable to similar breaches in the future. The breach is a wake-up call for users and companies to prioritize data security and take proactive measures to protect sensitive information. The investigation is ongoing, and users are advised to remain cautious and monitor their accounts for any suspicious activity. The breach highlights the importance of protecting sensitive data and the potential risks associated with not doing so.

A not guilty plea was entered for him.\n\nHowever, the presiding judge later adjourned the hearing indefinitely due to disclosure errors by prosecutors.\n\nThe judge, Alphons Orie, said judges were still analysing the\"scope and full impact\"of the errors.\n\nProsecuting counsel Peter McCloskey said that the crimes at Srebrenica had never been in dispute so the prosecution's focus would be on individual criminal responsibility.\n\nHe said that the Bosnian Serb Army was not an\"army out of control\"and that Gen Mladic had been on the ground and in command.\n\n\"We have radio intercepts of VRS [Bosnian Serb] soldiers and officers discussing murders. We have video of two of the actual executions themselves. So let me be perfectly clear,  the crime will not be the main focus of this prosecution. This case will be primarily about one issue. The individual criminal responsibility of Ratko Mladic,\"he said.\n\nThe court watched video of local people panicking in a UN compound outside Srebrenica on 11 July 1995 as Bosnian Serb forces approached, followed by scenes of Gen Mladic triumphantly entering the town.\n\nSpeaking directly into the camera he says:\"We give this town to the Serb nation as a gift. The time has come to take revenge on the Muslims.\"\n\nGen Mladic has presented an alibi for a crucial period of three days that followed.

They argue that the party's reluctance to call for an increase in corporation tax hits big businesses rather than hard-pressed families.

They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them. What they're doing is still illegal.\n\nThe route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.\n\nWhen he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked.\n\n\"I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them.\"\n\nHe started making\"mods\"to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet.\n\n\"I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency,\"Cameron said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nFor Jack, now 23, it was his\"laziness\"that led him into the world of computing.\n\n\"I was 12. We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it. \n\n\"I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra. It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things.\n\n\"I was trying to cut corners any way I could. Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well. \n\n\"I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute. After a while the school had had enough of me.\n\n\"I got my five GCSEs in Year 10 and then the school expelled me.\"\n\nJust four years after his arrest, Jack is now working at an advanced level, carrying out processes like penetration testing - trying to break into clients' servers to find weaknesses.\n\nHe and Cameron, now 19, also defend against incoming attacks - an area where their hacking experience comes in handy.\n\nOne of the more surreal moments in Cameron's first year at Bluescreen was going on the same course as the police officer who had arrested him in 2014.\n\nDet Sgt John Atkin from the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit was attending a Bluescreen security course as part of his own professional development.\n\nCameron said:\"It's unbelievable - what are the chances of that?\n\n\"I never would've thought when he was arresting me as a 14-year-old kid, that we'd one day be on the same course.\n\n\"There's an element of learning from each other now.

Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster.\"\n\nThere's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.\n\nThree monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.\n\nThe clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like\"Black Mamba\"or\"Green Starfish\"- usually a colour and an animal.\n\nThe business has just won part of a \u00a3500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.\n\nAs apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about \u00a3650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nBut for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.\n\nNow they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.\n\nIt's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with.\n\n\"It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve,\"said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore.\n\n\"We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that.\n\n\"It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle.\"\n\nBluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go.\n\n\"It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications,\"said Mr Cashmore.\n\n\"It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying.\"\nTL;DR:",

What they're doing is still illegal.\n\nThe route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.\n\nWhen he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked.\n\n\"I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them.\"\n\nHe started making\"mods\"to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet.\n\n\"I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency,\"Cameron said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nFor Jack, now 23, it was his\"laziness\"that led him into the world of computing.\n\n\"I was 12. We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it. \n\n\"I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra. It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things.\n\n\"I was trying to cut corners any way I could. Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well. \n\n\"I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute. After a while the school had had enough of me.\n\n\"I got my five GCSEs in Year 10 and then the school expelled me.\"\n\nJust four years after his arrest, Jack is now working at an advanced level, carrying out processes like penetration testing - trying to break into clients' servers to find weaknesses.\n\nHe and Cameron, now 19, also defend against incoming attacks - an area where their hacking experience comes in handy.\n\nOne of the more surreal moments in Cameron's first year at Bluescreen was going on the same course as the police officer who had arrested him in 2014.\n\nDet Sgt John Atkin from the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit was attending a Bluescreen security course as part of his own professional development.\n\nCameron said:\"It's unbelievable - what are the chances of that?\n\n\"I never would've thought when he was arresting me as a 14-year-old kid, that we'd one day be on the same course.\n\n\"There's an element of learning from each other now. Whenever something comes up in forensics he's the man to explain it best; we're lucky to have him there.\n\n\"And then for the attacks I can explain it better.\n\n\"We always got along, but I don't think John appreciated much of what I did.\"\n\nDet Sgt Atkin has\"no problem\"meeting the hackers he's arrested because the whole point of the police Cyber Futures programme is to\"try and develop people\".\n\n\"What you can see here is that by working with Cameron and his family, and providing the support and knowledge we have, we're able to deliver and put him in a place where his future is set, rather than where he could have been.\n\n\"Cameron's a good kid so he's doing really well; the future's bright for him. Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster.\"\n\nThere's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.\n\nThree monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.\n\nThe clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like\"Black Mamba\"or\"Green Starfish\"- usually a colour and an animal.\n\nThe business has just won part of a \u00a3500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.\n\nAs apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about \u00a3650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nBut for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.\n\nNow they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.\n\nIt's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with.\n\n\"It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve,\"said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore.\n\n\"We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that.\n\n\"It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle.\"\n\nBluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go.\n\n\"It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications,\"said Mr Cashmore.\n\n\"It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying.\"",

These individuals, known as \"grey hat hackers,\" have committed crimes for reasons other than personal gain or cyber-terrorism, and are now working to prevent similar attacks on others. The company has a direct link with the police to identify individuals who are capable of reform and provides them with training and support. Former hackers like Jack and Cameron, who were arrested for their crimes, are now working at Bluescreen, carrying out penetration testing and defending against incoming attacks. The company has received a grant to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs and is adapting to accommodate employees with autism. Bluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people and provide them with a second chance, and its employees are achieving industry-recognised qualifications.\n\nNote: The summary is significantly shorter than the original text, retaining only essential details, and is written in a neutral and objective tone.

The new brand aims to cater to digitally savvy customers, offering online-only services with no exit fees and 100% renewable energy sources. Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, is expected to provide more details about the new brand in July, following a 5,000-job cut announcement due to its own financial struggles, including a \u00a3849m loss in the last calendar year. The energy supply market has undergone significant changes, with the \"Big Six\" dominance breaking down, and new players like Ovo and Shell-backed First Utility making inroads. Centrica's new CEO, Chris O'Shea, has vowed to modernize the company's outdated employee contracts, which date back over 35 years.

Despite a general decrease in metal thefts, councils are being targeted, particularly those with stretched finances. The worst-hit councils were Torfaen and Caerphilly, with costs of \u00a3247,176 and \u00a3132,431 respectively. Police efforts to combat the problem are underway, including Operation Tornado, which requires scrap operators to verify sellers' identities and addresses. Additionally, councils are taking action, such as using SmartWater to mark items and replacing metal bins with plastic ones, which has resulted in a 50% reduction in metal theft in some areas. Overall, the problem remains a major concern for police and councils in Wales.

They paralyse muscles and can lead to death by asphyxiation.\n\nWhat measures has the US taken?\n\nSanctions are being imposed on seven senior Russian officials and 14 entities involved in chemical and biological production, administration officials said.\n\n\"Russia's attempt to kill Mr Navalny follows an alarming pattern of chemical weapons use by Russia,\"one official said.\n\nNovichok was used in a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury against a Russian exiled double-agent and his daughter.\n\nUnder the sanctions, the assets of the officials in the US are frozen.\n\nThose targeted include Alexander Bortnikov, who heads the FSB, Russia's main intelligence agency, as well as deputy Defence Ministers Alexei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov.\n\nThe sanctions are the first imposed on Russia by the administration of President Joe Biden.

It is a sharp turn away from the approach of the former president, Donald Trump, who was reluctant to confront the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \n\nUS officials said they were seeking neither an escalation nor a reset with Russia. The goal is to have a\"predictable and stable\"relationship that leaves space for co-operation on areas such as nuclear proliferation - but also to be clear that there are costs for behaviour that crosses boundaries\"respected by responsible nations\". \n\nThe US is also seeking to work with European allies. The officials said the US was catching up with measures the EU had taken earlier and mirroring others it was taking now.  \n\nFurther sanctions could be levied in three other areas under review. These include allegations that Russia interfered in the 2020 presidential election, carried out a cyber-hack of US government networks, and paid bounties to Taliban linked militants for killing US soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nHow has Moscow reacted?\n\nThe Russian government responded even before the US and EU moves were confirmed.\n\nEarly on Tuesday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated his claim that the West was\"hiding the facts that could help to understand what had happened\"to Navalny and was unfairly punishing Russia.\n\n\"We have repeatedly expressed our position in regards to illegitimate unilateral sanctions that... are used by the colleagues from the United States and those who take an example from them, the European Union,\"he said.\n\nHis government would respond in kind to any sanctions, he added.\n\nWho is Alexei Navalny?\n\nAn anti-corruption campaigner, he has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to Mr Putin's rule.\n\nThe 44-year-old blogger has millions of followers on social media. He managed to get some of his supporters elected to councils in Siberia in 2020.\n\nNavalny was poisoned and fell into a coma during a flight to Siberia last August. He was airlifted to Germany, where he recovered. In January he decided to return to Russia and was arrested on arrival.\n\nA court last month found that Navalny had violated the terms of an earlier sentence for embezzlement by not turning up to the probation office while he was being treated in Germany.\n\nHis suspended sentence was turned into an actual prison term of two-and-a-half years. Last week he was sent from detention in Moscow to a penal colony to serve out the sentence.\n\nNavalny and his supporters say all charges against him are politically motivated.

Russia responded with tit-for-tat sanctions. \n\nAll change\n\nThis is the first step by the Biden administration to respond to what it calls Russia's\"malign\"activity. It is a sharp turn away from the approach of the former president, Donald Trump, who was reluctant to confront the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. \n\nUS officials said they were seeking neither an escalation nor a reset with Russia. The goal is to have a\"predictable and stable\"relationship that leaves space for co-operation on areas such as nuclear proliferation - but also to be clear that there are costs for behaviour that crosses boundaries\"respected by responsible nations\". \n\nThe US is also seeking to work with European allies. The officials said the US was catching up with measures the EU had taken earlier and mirroring others it was taking now.  \n\nFurther sanctions could be levied in three other areas under review. These include allegations that Russia interfered in the 2020 presidential election, carried out a cyber-hack of US government networks, and paid bounties to Taliban linked militants for killing US soldiers in Afghanistan.\n\nHow has Moscow reacted?\n\nThe Russian government responded even before the US and EU moves were confirmed.\n\nEarly on Tuesday Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated his claim that the West was\"hiding the facts that could help to understand what had happened\"to Navalny and was unfairly punishing Russia.\n\n\"We have repeatedly expressed our position in regards to illegitimate unilateral sanctions that... are used by the colleagues from the United States and those who take an example from them, the European Union,\"he said.\n\nHis government would respond in kind to any sanctions, he added.\n\nWho is Alexei Navalny?\n\nAn anti-corruption campaigner, he has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to Mr Putin's rule.\n\nThe 44-year-old blogger has millions of followers on social media. He managed to get some of his supporters elected to councils in Siberia in 2020.\n\nNavalny was poisoned and fell into a coma during a flight to Siberia last August. He was airlifted to Germany, where he recovered. In January he decided to return to Russia and was arrested on arrival.\n\nA court last month found that Navalny had violated the terms of an earlier sentence for embezzlement by not turning up to the probation office while he was being treated in Germany.\n\nHis suspended sentence was turned into an actual prison term of two-and-a-half years. Last week he was sent from detention in Moscow to a penal colony to serve out the sentence.\n\nNavalny and his supporters say all charges against him are politically motivated. President Biden and EU leaders have called for his immediate release.",

The move, coordinated with similar actions by the European Union, includes freezing assets and imposing travel bans on the targeted individuals. The sanctions follow an EU announcement of penalties on four Russian officials. Moscow denies involvement in the attack and has vowed to retaliate against any US sanctions, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov calling the measures \"illegitimate.\" The US and EU actions are seen as a response to Russia's \"malign\" activity, with President Joe Biden taking a tougher stance against President Vladimir Putin than his predecessor Donald Trump. Navalny, a vocal critic of Putin, was poisoned last August and has since been sentenced to prison on what he and his supporters claim are politically motivated charges. The US and EU have called for his immediate release. The sanctions are the first imposed on Russia by the Biden administration, and further measures are being considered in response to Russia's alleged interference in the 2020 US presidential election, cyber-hacks, and payment of bounties to Taliban-linked militants. \n\nNote: I've maintained the same language and tone as the original article, ensuring factual accuracy and coherence.

A recent and rather more scientific study, carried in an American hospital, came to very different conclusions.\n\nFind out more\n\nTrust Me I'm A Doctor is on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 20 January - catch up on BBC iPlayer\n\nIn this study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, they swabbed the faces of 408 hospital staff with and without facial hair.\n\nThey had good reasons for doing so. We know that hospital-acquired infections are a major cause of disease and death in hospitals, with many patients acquiring an infection they didn't have when they went in. Hands, white coats, ties and equipment have all been blamed, but what about beards?\n\nWell, the researchers were surprised to find that it was the clean-shaven staff, and not the beardies, who were more likely to be carrying something unpleasant on their faces. \n\nThe beardless group were more than three times as likely to be harbouring a species known as methicillin-resistant staph aureus on their freshly shaven cheeks. MRSA is a particularly common and troublesome source of hospital-acquired infections because it is resistant to so many of our current antibiotics.\n\nSo what's going on? The researchers suggested that shaving might cause micro-abrasions in the skin\"which may support bacterial colonisation and proliferation\".\n\nPerhaps. But there was another more plausible explanation staring them in the face. That beards fight infection.\n\nUnlikely? Well, driven by curiosity we recently swabbed the beards of a random assortment of men and sent them off to Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist based at University College London, to see what, if anything, he could grow.\n\nAdam managed to grow over 100 different bacteria from our beards, including one that is more commonly found in the small intestine. But, as he quickly explains, that doesn't mean it came from faeces. Such findings are normal and nothing to worry about.\n\nA brief history of beards\n\nFar more interesting, in a few of the petri dishes he noticed that something was clearly killing the other bacteria. The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe.\n\nWe see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics.\n\nPenicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon.\n\nPurifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics.\n\nAs he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years.\n\nAs well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel.\n\nSurprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR:",

The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe.\n\nWe see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics.\n\nPenicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. \n\nSo could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin?\n\n\"Yes,\"says Adam extremely cautiously.\"Possibly.\"\n\nAdam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon.\n\nPurifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics.\n\nAs he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years.\n\nAs well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel.\n\nSurprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.",
            "prediction": "Scientists have discovered that the bacteria living in men's beards can produce antibiotics that kill off other bacteria, raising hopes for new treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections.\n---\n\nHere's a possible summary:\n\nScientists from the BBC's \"Trust Me I'm a Doctor\" series have made a groundbreaking discovery about the bacteria living in men's beards. In a study, researchers found that beards contain over 100 different types of bacteria, including some that produce antibiotics. Notably, they discovered a species of bacteria called Staphylococcus epidermidis that can kill off other bacteria, including some that are resistant to antibiotics. This finding has significant implications for the development of new antibiotics, as antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year and are projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. The researchers are excited about the potential of these findings and are exploring ways to harness the power of these natural antibiotics to combat infections. The discovery highlights the importance of beards in fighting infection and challenges the common perception that they are a source of germs.  Word count: 152.  Style: Formal and neutral.

Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy.

The measures have been met with criticism from both those who are homeless and local authorities. Homeless individuals argue that the fines are unfair and that they cannot afford to pay them, while a Conservative councillor suggests that the scheme has failed to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent beggars. A campaign group has also called for the powers to be reviewed, citing concerns that the measures do not effectively address the issue of homelessness. Currently, 12 fines have been handed out, but none have been paid. One person is being prosecuted for non-payment.

Zeyh) over a 10-year period recorded no adverse effects in terms of tree growth or crown density.\n\n\"Those individual A. hippocastanum that suffered the highest rates of damage might have been expected to show some decrease in growth and canopy condition over time but even in these trees, there was no detectable response,\"they explained.\n\nThey added that red horse chestnut trees were\"rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested [white-flowered horse chestnut trees]\".\n\nHowever, it was not the case when it came to bleeding canker disease, which seemed to spread more rapidly through the A. carnea population.\n\nThey said data showed that the disease was responsible for the death or removal of 27% of the UK's red-flowered horse chestnut trees and 11% of the nation's white-flowered horse chestnuts.\n\nBleeding canker disease (BCD) has been recorded in the UK for decades, but recently there has been a surge in the number of cases being recorded throughout many European countries, including the UK.\n\n'Serious threat'\n\nExperts have identified that most of the new cases were being caused by a bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi, which has previously only been known to infect Indian horse chestnuts.\n\nThey say early symptoms tend to be limited to bleeding lesions of dark, sticky liquid from patches of bark on infected trees' stems or branches.\n\nForestry Commission plant health scientists say that if the disease is severe and the areas of bark which are killed are extensive, large trees can undoubtedly be killed.  However, younger trees (10-30 years old) are at greater risk and can succumb to the disease in just a few years.\n\nDrs Straw and Williams described BCD as a\"much more serious threat\"because the\"rate at which the disease has spread through the horse chestnut populations has shown no sign of slowing down in recent years, and it is still too early to say how many trees will be killed eventually and how many might survive\".\n\nContrary to the opinion that trees with foliage damage caused by leaf miners would be more susceptible to BCD and help accelerate its spread, Dr Straw said the decade-long study did not support such a view.\n\n\"Trees that have heavily damage foliage by the leaf miner do not get the (bleeding canker) disease more often and they do not suffer from it any more severely so we cannot see that the impact of the leaf miner is causing sufficient stress in the trees to make them more susceptible to the disease,\"he explained. \n\n\"The two organisms seem to be operating independently.\"\n\nDr Straw said Forest Research scientists had been concerned by attempts to treat horse chestnut trees with insecticides in order to curb the spread of leaf miners.\n\n\"This was based on the argument that by controlling the moth you would help stop the trees from becoming infected with bleeding canker disease,\"he added. \n\n\"What we have shown is that there is no point doing that.

            "prediction": "A study by Forest Research found that horse chestnut trees attacked by a leaf miner moth are not more susceptible to a deadly disease known as bleeding canker.\n\nHere is the rewritten summary:\n\nA study published in the Agriculture and Forestry Entomology journal has investigated the impact of the horse chestnut leaf miner on horse chestnut trees in the UK. The study, conducted by Forest Research, aimed to determine whether the leaf miner's damage to the trees leaves them susceptible to bleeding canker disease. The findings suggest that the leaf miner's damage has no significant effect on the trees' growth or resistance to disease. In fact, the study found that trees heavily damaged by the leaf miner do not suffer from bleeding canker disease more frequently or severely than undamaged trees. The researchers conclude that the two pathogens operate independently, and controlling the leaf miner population will not help prevent the spread of bleeding canker disease. The study's findings emphasize the need for tree management strategies to focus on the threat posed by bleeding canker disease. The researchers will continue to monitor the trees in the study area to gain further insights into the spread of the disease and any potential natural resistance in individual trees. \n\nNote: I've maintained the same language and tone as the original article, ensuring the summary is concise, coherent, and free from personal opinions or biases.

These ten-legged crustaceans descended from a single female with a genetic mutation that allows them to reproduce without males. Found in the wild in Japan, Madagascar, and various European countries, they are also sold as pets in North America, despite warnings. The study warns that these invasive species pose a threat to native species, particularly in Madagascar, where they are being introduced as a source of protein. The marbled crayfish's ability to multiply exponentially in a short period makes them a concern for ecosystems worldwide. Sales of the species have been banned in the European Union and in some US states, but their populations in the wild continue to grow. Researchers are studying the crayfish's adaptability to better understand how cancer tumours develop resistance to treatments.

The US has reaffirmed its commitment to defending Japan and South Korea, with US Defence Secretary James Mattis stating that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an \"effective and overwhelming\" response.

They will want to get even, perhaps more than that. \n\nProxy forces\n\nDespite arms embargoes, Iran has developed a modern arsenal of rockets and missiles. But if it wanted to use them against US forces as part of a reprisal, Iran would risk making matters worse.\n\nAn act of war to answer that of the US - for example attacking US ships in the Gulf - would risk provoking a devastating response. Iran's oil refineries are on the coast and would be easy targets for the vast firepower the US has in and around the Gulf.\n\nWhen Iran retaliates, it is likely to follow Soleimani's own indirect tactics: so-called asymmetric warfare, spurning an attack through the front door for one through a side window. \n\nSoleimani cultivated a range of well-armed militias, which give Iran options short of a head-to-head confrontation with the Americans which it would only lose.  \n\nThe Americans will now be looking at their most vulnerable deployments in the Middle East.

Soleimani, a key figure in Iran's military, was seen as a formidable enemy of the US. His killing has triggered vows of vengeance from Iran, which could lead to a series of bloody events. While neither side seems keen on war, Iran's proxy forces and its arsenal of rockets and missiles pose a threat to US forces. The US decision to kill Soleimani may be seen as a calculated risk, assuming Iran's weakened regime will not offer a serious strategic threat. However, this assumption may prove dangerous and wrong, given the potential for miscalculation. A crisis has been created, with Iran planning its response to Soleimani's death. \n\nPlease ensure your summary maintains the required tone, coherence, and factual accuracy. \n\n(Note: If you need any further clarification or have any questions, feel free to ask!)<|eot_id|>",
