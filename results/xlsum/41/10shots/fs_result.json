They will also be able to hire and dismiss the chief constable and set the force's budget.\n\nThe commissioners will be paid and are supposed to empower local people into having a say on how crime is tackled in their area.\n\nNominations for candidates in Norfolk have now officially closed.\n\nBBC News has taken a look at each of the police forces ahead of the elections.\n\nNorfolk Police\n\nNorfolk Constabulary monitors crime in the predominately rural county, which is the fifth largest in England and has a population of 858,000. \n\nPolice also have to deal with an influx of holidaymakers during the summer to its coastal resorts and the Norfolk Broads, which has its own specialist Broads Beat.\n\nThe constabulary's main priorities for 2012 to 2015 are to reduce re-offending, priority crimes and anti-social behaviour, improve levels of service satisfaction and sustain financial stability.\n\nNorfolk Police is led by Chief Constable Phil Gormley, with Simon Bailey, who looks after performance and standards, second in charge. \n\nDepartments in the force monitor community safety, criminal justice and royalty protection, with the Queen's Sandringham Estate based in the west of the county.\n\nNorfolk and neighbouring Suffolk Police also collaborate on many tasks, including major investigations and campaigns.\n\nFunding\n\nNorfolk Police's budget for 2012 was set at \u00a3145m by Norfolk Police Authority. \n\nThe constabulary, which has about 1,500 officers, has been put under pressure to save \u00a325m between 2011 and 2014 and it aims to reduce officer posts by between 150 and 250 over the period. \n\nInstead of opting to take a government grant, the authority increased the council tax precept towards the police in February to 3%, which saw about a 0.4% rise in the public's tax bill. \n\nIt said the move was to protect as many services as it could throughout the budget cuts. \n\nThe force hopes to save at least \u00a39.8m by merging its support services, including human resources, media and communications and estates and facilities, with Suffolk Police.\n\nCrime and performance\n\nDespite the range of crimes the force has to deal with, Home Office figures show Norfolk is the safest county in England, with a rate of 50 crimes per 1,000 residents. \n\nThis compares to the country's average of 66 per 1,000. \n\nAccording to January statistics, Norfolk Police is also detecting more crimes than ever, with the force having the sixth highest detection rate in England.\n\nDeputy Ch Con Simon Bailey said:\"For the majority of crime categories, Norfolk has seen reductions. Where there have been increases, we have looked at why this may be the case and the analysis proves helpful in understanding the bigger picture.\n\n\"There are some categories of crime that people are reluctant to report. These are often related to domestic violence and we are actively working to encourage people to report these crimes so we can better understand them and, ultimately, take measures to break the cycle.\"\nTL;DR: On 15 November, 37 police and crime commissioners will be elected in England along with four in Wales.\n\nArticle: By Tom SymondsHome Affairs correspondent\n\nThe fighters face each other, ready. One rushes forward into a clash of jaws. The ground is already flecked with blood.\n\nThe lighter one is winning, locked onto its opponent. The black one has lost the ability to fight back.  Now, it simply fights for survival.\n\nEventually it attempts to walk, but collapses, legs giving way, head hitting the ground.  \n\nThe fight is over. It dies the next day.\n\nDogs don't do this naturally, experts say.  \n\nThey are trained, by men who smile, encourage and place bets, as their animals tear themselves apart.   \n\nThis is the disturbing world of organised dogfighting.\n\nIn 2016 the BBC was briefed exclusively on dogfighting by the British charity, the League Against Cruel Sports (LACS.)\n\nFormer police officers had identified key players in an international scene.  \n\n\"There is still a significant amount going on,\"says the League's head of investigations Martin Simms. In the last year the organisation has received nearly 100 calls about dogfighting to a confidential hotline it runs.\n\nThe charity had evidence that men were breeding, training, buying, selling and betting on fighting dogs - or as they are known in the business,\"game dogs\".  \n\nThe LACS investigation, codenamed Operation Bloodline, was aided by the internet. \n\nAnimal fighting is an ancient pastime, which, like most subcultures, has now found its place online.\n\nGrand champions\n\nFor\"dog men\"- and it is almost always men - reputation is the currency that matters.  \n\nSo the merits of particular dogs and breeders are now discussed on Facebook, on specialist closed forums, and - between those involved - on messaging apps.\n\nSometimes they operate in plain sight, using terminology the average reader might not understand. A dog could be described as a Grand Champion (Gr Ch), a five-times winner or a champion (Ch) with three wins. \n\nThey are not talking about Crufts.\n\nFormer police detective, Mark Randell, runs Hidden-In-Sight, a private investigations agency specialising in wildlife crime. He led the LACS investigation until 2017.\n\n\"'Ch' is used in kennel club circles but in a different context,\"he said.\"'Ch' next to a large muscled dog with a chain and facial injuries will always be dogfighting.\"\n\nRandell has identified around 70 British people linked with dogfighting.  \n\nBut the LACS investigators had worked covertly to gather the evidence.  \n\nPublishing it would blow their covers. So in 2017 we began our own investigation into the international dogfighting scene, and we picked a promising target.\n\nIvaylo Nikolov is 37, an intelligent, friendly, English-speaking Bulgarian from the Danube city of Ruse in the north of the country.  \n\nIvo, as we came to know him, is associated with a company that buys, sells and transports dogs around the world.\n\nThe Balkans has become the centre of Europe's dogfighting business.\n\nIvo liked to document his work on Facebook. The League Against Cruel Sports gathered posts suggesting he has travelled to around 29 countries, including the UK, with his dogs.\n\nBut among the messages, status posts and check-ins were interesting clues.  \n\nOne picture suggested the animals he transports are not just family pets\n\nA dog had ripped apart the bars of its travel cage, causing bloody damage in the process.  \n\nIn other places he occasionally slipped up and used dogfighting terminology.   \n\nIt was time to find out more about him.  \n\nWe asked an Italian animal welfare investigator Sylvia (not her real name) to start sending Ivo WhatsApp messages. \n\nShe told him she had relatives in a hunting lodge interested in buying a certain type of dog. \n\nOne of them was Nik. Older, with an impressive beard, he looked the part.  \n\nNik was from the countryside of Northern Italy, and spoke no English. Sylvia would translate for him in English. \n\nNeither Sylvia nor Nik were experts in match dogs, but behind the scenes a former police officer with decades of experience investigating dogfighting, was also working for the BBC, advising them about the right language to use.  \n\nSylvia sent Ivo a picture of a fake handwritten note from the hunters, a shopping list of dogs they were interested in (with an actual shopping list for food added at the bottom as if she had been short of paper.)  \n\nThe dogs specified included some for hunting, but also pitbulls, the breed of choice for dog fighting. \n\nThe American Pitbull Terrier is almost the only type prepared to fight for long periods. It is banned under Britain's controversial Dangerous Dogs Act.  \n\n'A very good dog'\n\nIvo took the bait. The deal started to develop. The hunting dogs were forgotten as the weeks went on.  \n\nEventually Ivo offered Sylvia and Nik a\"very good dog\".\n\n\"Reliable and ready for match,\"he wrote in one message. Nik, he said, could\"bet good money on him\".\n\nThe price would be 3,000 euros (approximately \u00a32,698) plus costs. The dog would be supplied by Ivo's contact, a kennel in Moldova, a day's drive from Bulgaria.  \n\nBy this point we'd learnt a lot about Ivo and his dogs. The international salesman had been keen to demonstrate his credentials.\n\nHis WhatsApp messages kept Sylvia and Nik up-to-date on the dogfighting scene.\n\nHe sent a video of a match - apparently showing the dogs mentioned in his messages fighting in an undisclosed Eastern European location.   \n\nSylvia received a match report.\"One win, in one hour and 17 minutes\", read a message. Fights sometimes stretch to two hours.\n\n\"Please keep the video very private,\"he added.  \n\nTwo weeks later he was planning a trip to the Caribbean where he was expecting to see seven dogfights.  \n\nBut eventually he sent a fight video including a dog he was offering for sale.  \n\nThe video is difficult to watch.  \n\nBy the end the dogs are covered with blood.  The watching men hold\"break sticks\"- used to pull apart the animals - in hands which are also red with blood.  \n\nThe confrontation is what is known as a\"roll\"- an informal match sometimes used to prove a dog's willingness to fight. \n\n'True pure love'\n\nIvo offered to take our undercover investigators to rolls.\n\n\"We will have fun in our field,\"he said.\n\nHe appeared to have a genuine love for dogs but also for dogfighting. By now, he believed our investigators shared his feelings.\n\nHe said:\"It's always very great joy for me when I meet people with such a great desire, and I'm not talking about sales, money or anything else. I'm only talking about the true pure love for the game.\"\n\nYet it was partly about money. Ivo was so impressed with the dog he was selling, he wanted to bet on it\"when he's ready to match\".\n\nWhat we didn't have was his home address or that of the kennels to which he was connected.  \n\nHe had been careful not to give away this vital information.\n\nSo we began planning to lure him to a meeting. Everything he had suggested was illegal in Bulgaria.\n\nMeanwhile, information from the League Against Cruel Sports led us to valuable sources of intelligence about dogfighting online.\n\nThey included specialist websites where owners record the pedigrees of their dogs and sometimes the results of their matches.  \n\nThey do not use their real identities, instead hiding behind nicknames or the names of their kennels.\n\nWales link\n\nIn 2014 someone using the name The Gameyard posted a picture of a pitbull named Iceboy.  \n\nSo who was Iceboy, and most importantly, who was The Gameyard? \n\nThe clue was in the background of the picture, which we identified from the shapes of distant hills and nearby buildings, as Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, near the Brecon Beacons.  \n\nIn fact it was possible to pinpoint the exact location at which the picture was taken - a patch of grass within walking distance of the home of dogfighter Kerry Evans.  \n\nHe was convicted in 2014 of keeping or training Pit Bull Terriers but not, at that point, sent to prison.\n\nDogfighting in the UK is a crime which attracts maximum sentences of just six months, handed down by a magistrate rather than being heard in a crown court. \n\nCampaigners say that must change.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at Evans - or rather his dogs - so we started to examine the animal's\"bloodline\".\n\nThe bloodline is a crucial concept in dogfighting. Dogs which perform well in fights are highly valued. Those with tenacity are described as displaying\"gameness\".  \n\nThose who shy away are dismissed as\"curs\". \n\nA game dog will pass its abilities to its offspring through breeding. And the bloodlines of top dogs are highly valued.\n\nSome become legendary. \n\nOne, called Chinaman, was notorious for continuing a fight despite critical injuries. Its bloodline and its name have been passed to countless animals around the world.  \n\nOn the pedigree websites Iceboy's father, or sire, was listed as\"Aspen\", a dog bred by\"Tomy Kennels\".\n\nAnd who is Tomy Kennels?  \n\nBack to our Bulgarian dealer, Ivaylo Nikolov, or as his Facebook profile describes him, Ivaylo Tomy Flyman Nikolov. \n\nTomy Kennels is directly linked to Ivo. \n\nWe have evidence that he provided dogs to Kerry Evans in the UK, possibly to breed from.\n\nA Facebook post showed one of his dogs, named Aspen and listed as a champion, was brought to the UK in 2016.  It may have been used to breed a number of British fighting dogs.\n\nBy now, our undercover investigators, Sylvia and Nik, were making good progress.   \n\nThey had arranged to meet Ivo in Bucharest, en route from his home across the Danube in Bulgaria to the kennels in Moldova where the fighting dog we had ordered would be picked up.\n\nThe BBC was not about to put 3,000 euros into the pocket of a dogfighter, so the meeting, in a burger restaurant, had to be handled carefully.\n\nCaptured by our hidden cameras, Ivo arrived, having battled through rush-hour traffic.  The final details of the deal, thrashed out on WhatsApp, were agreed face-to-face.\n\nMoldovan papers \n\nIvo's Moldovan dog breeder contact was giving them the pick of the litter, he said.\n\n\"He gets the best ones and he either goes to match or he calls me and he says'these are the two or three ones which are the best ones.  If you have a good client I may sell, nothing else.'\"\n\nSylvia asked how we would get the dog through customs checks. Transporting a dog for use in fighting is illegal.\n\nIvo said his contact in Moldova\"is actually a state vet in his region\"and can issue\"any document we want\".\n\nBut he said,\"when you travel with Moldovan papers you have too much checks so I have made Bulgarian documents, also blood tests and export certificates.\"\n\nOften the exact breed of the dogs are'fudged' to make it harder for customs officials to detect whether they fall foul of laws such as Britain's Dangerous Dogs Act.  \n\nDog microchips can also be inserted by anyone with the right device.\n\nIt was time to confront Ivaylo Nikolov as he left the restaurant.\n\nApparently stunned at being exposed, he refused to make any comment.\n\n\"I don't know you, I don't want to talk to you,\"he said.\n\nPursued by a BBC camera crew he attempted to get away.  He walked straight past his car parked nearby, perhaps concerned its licence plate might be captured on camera.  \n\nIn fact we had already identified the plate, which briefly appeared in a video he had previously sent to our undercover investigators.\n\nNikolov refused to answer any of our questions. But a couple of days later, the Facebook account which he had told our investigators was crucial to what he did, was taken down.  YouTube links he had sent, also disappeared.\n\nHe hasn't responded to our further attempts to contact him.\n\nA love of dogs\n\nDogfighting is illegal in most of the world's developed countries.  \n\nUK law bans not only fighting, but also owning fighting dogs, training them to fight, trading animals and even filming fights without good reason.\n\nThe RSPCA's head of investigations, Mike Butcher, is the country's only expert witness in dogfighting able to give evidence in court.  \n\nHe is fascinated by the dogfighting criminals he has encountered on raids with the police.\n\nThey have\"an obsessive love\"for dogs, he says.\n\n\"We've been to houses before where we've said we're taking your money, your drugs, your gun. They say'yeah right but you're not having my dog though'. I've seen them attack four or five coppers, or burst into tears.\"\n\nYet organised dogfights inevitably result in animal deaths and serious injuries.  \n\nThe referee usually has no power to stop the fight.  Only a fatality or an owner withdrawing their dog brings the cruelty to an end.\n\nThe League Against Cruel Sports believes dogfighting is not being properly tackled.  \n\nIt wants a national register of owners who are banned from owning dogs, a review of the Dangerous Dogs Act and tougher sentences.\n\nIts research raises concerns not just about high-level organised fights, but also the use of dogs by street gangs, either to settle scores through ad-hoc matches or for protection.\n\nDogfighters are also more likely to be involved in other types of serious crime. \n\nAnd there is evidence of a low-level group of\"wannabe\"dogfighters obsessed with the culture of\"strong\"dogs.\n\nThese are dogs who may not take part in matches, but are trained to be aggressive, risking injury to other animals and people.\n\nDuring our investigation we obtained footage of dogs being kicked or lifted into the air by their jaws, to improve the strength of their bite.\n\nOne chilling video from a Northern Ireland dogfighting case showed men shaking a cat out of a tree, so that it could be ripped apart by a dog on the ground.  \n\nThe charity's further investigations have produced a wider list of possible suspects. \n\nAs a result, recently the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals raided a house in Dumfries, seizing three dogs.\n\nAn animal cruelty investigation has been launched. \n\nAs for Ivo, after we confronted him, his social media profiles were taken offline and, sadly, the dog he offered us remains in the world of dogfighting.\nTL;DR: A BBC investigation into the dark world of organised dogfighting discovered an illegal trade of fighting dogs stretching from Eastern Europe to Wales.\n\nArticle: He now lives primarily in the UK according to filings for his companies, which include his family office.\n\nSir James had faced criticism after he announced that he would relocate his firm's global head office to Singapore in 2019.\n\nThis week he was also involved in a controversy over texting Prime Minister Boris Johnson about tax issues.\n\nA Dyson spokesman declined to comment on Sir James' residence and tax status but did say:\"The structure of the group and the business rationale underpinning it are unaltered.\"\n\n\"Singapore is, and remains, the global headquarters of Dyson, our leadership team is based here and it is the centre of our sales, engineering and manufacturing operations,\"he said. \n\nA prominent supporter of Brexit with an estimated fortune of more than $20bn, Sir James was criticised after the announcement in 2019 that Dyson was moving its headquarters to Singapore from Malmesbury in Wiltshire.\n\nAt the time, the company said just two senior executives would be relocated and no jobs would be lost in the UK as a result of the move.\n\nSir James has this week been at the centre of a political row in Britain after it was revealed that he texted Boris Johnson in March last year to get assurance that his staff would not face a change in their tax situation if they came to the UK to help make ventilators in response to Covid-19.\n\nThe texts - seen by the BBC - show Mr Johnson saying he could\"fix\"tax issues relating to Dyson staff who came to the UK to work on the pandemic.\n\nBut the prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Johnson had abided by the ministerial code, governing conduct in office, and had\"informed officials in a timely manner\"after his contact with Sir James.\n\nLabour has called for a\"thorough investigation\"into Mr Johnson's contacts with Sir James.\n\nWhen Sir James announced Dyson would move its global headquarters, he was accused of hypocrisy, after arguing in the run-up to the Brexit referendum that the UK would gain more from leaving the EU than it would lose.\n\nHowever, in a recent interview with the BBC, he said:\"We're a British company - I've put a lot into this country.\n\n\"I can't make things here and bring over all the components from the Far East here, assemble them here and then send them back to the Far East. That just doesn't work.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Dyson announced plans to create 200 new jobs at its research facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington, Wiltshire.\n\nThe plans are part of a \u00a32.75bn global investment plan into emerging technologies and products.\n\nSir James said the end of the UK's transition period with the EU had enabled Dyson to hire the engineering talent it was lacking in the UK.\n\nFreedom of movement between the UK and EU has ended and the government has introduced a points-based immigration system which it says\"treats all applicants equally, regardless of where they come from\".\n\nHowever, some argue that UK companies who want to hire from outside the EU are in no better position than before Brexit, while attempts to hire EU workers now face significant costs and administration that did not exist before.\n\nThe text messages between Sir James Dyson and the PM show his concern about the Statutory Residence Test for his company's ability to help make ventilators.\n\nThis test is designed to ensure that those working abroad and not paying UK income tax, really do work abroad and have few ties to the UK. \n\nThey are quite complex, but broadly speaking if total or consecutive days are spent in the UK above some threshold, or if they are spent working, than the worker no longer qualifies for non residence. In the case of a Singapore-resident Briton that would mean earnings incurring a tax rate of up to 45% in the UK rather than up to 22% there. \n\nSir James is lobbying the PM, that if, as requested by Mr Johnson in mid-March, help is needed making ventilators, then this barrier to spending more time in the UK needs to be set aside. The Dyson owner clearly felt it was a material barrier to his ability to help.\n\nIn the end, the project did not proceed. JCB did make housings for Dyson's prototypes. But it proved too challenging for a new design to get rigorous medical safety approvals. The project to supply the UK was paused on 24 April. Manufacturers turned to mass manufacture of an existing design.\n\nBut the government did change the law, with Section 190 of the Finance Bill disregarding working days between March and June 2020 from residence calculations, for those working on treatment, prevention and medical products to deal with the pandemic.\n\nIt is unclear how many workers benefitted from this provision, at Dyson or elsewhere. Indeed, it might not become clear, even to tax authorities, until that financial year's returns are filed next January.\nTL;DR: High-profile businessman Sir James Dyson has moved his residency back to the UK from Singapore.\n\nArticle: The boys will be eligible from the start of the new school year, 11 years after girls were first vaccinated.\n\nThe jab protects against human papilloma virus, which causes many oral, throat and anal cancers.\n\nOne man, Jamie Rae, says he went\"to hell and back\"during his treatment for throat cancer caused by the virus.\n\n\"All the things you enjoy are gone. I couldn't speak or eat for months afterwards, and I was just skeletal by the end of it,\"he says.\n\n'I was left with no saliva to eat'\n\nJamie, from Falkirk, had never heard of HPV when he found a small, disc-shaped lump growing in his neck.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in 2010, aged 44, he had a tonsillectomy and then six weeks of chemotherapy and six of radiotherapy.\n\nHe needed therapy to retrain his muscles so he could talk again - and he was left with very little saliva, making eating and even drinking water a real challenge.\n\nAll that took its toll, Jamie says.\n\n\"I became very depressed and it was two years before I started to feel normal again.\"\n\nAt that point he set up a foundation to raise awareness of the virus that had caused him so much pain.\n\nHow do boys get the vaccine?\n\nBoys aged 12 and 13 in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, along with boys aged 11 and 12 in high schools in Scotland, will be offered the vaccine in secondary schools from the start of the next school term.\n\nBecause health policy is devolved in the UK, timings and arrangements will vary slightly across the different nations.\n\nGirls aged 12 to 13 have been offered the HPV vaccine since 2008 in the UK.\n\nTwo doses are needed to be fully protected. Protection lasts for at least 10 years, although probably much longer.\n\nWhy are boys now getting the jab?\n\nBecause the programme to vaccinate teenage girls, and reduce cervical cancers, has proved very successful.\n\nThere has been a reduction in HPV infections, genital warts and pre-cancerous growths in teenage girls and young women since the vaccine was introduced.\n\nOther groups, like teenage boys, have seen benefits too because the virus is not being passed on to them.\n\nTo protect boys even more, and reduce cancers of the anus, penis and head and neck in the future, health experts say they should be offered the HPV vaccine too.\n\nWhy is it needed at that age?\n\nThe HPV vaccine works best if boys and girls get it before they become sexually active.\n\nHigh-risk HPV infections can be spread by any skin-to-skin contact, and are usually found on the fingers, hands, mouth and genitals.\n\nThis means the virus can be spread during any kind of sexual activity, including touching.\n\nWhat about older boys?\n\nBoys who are 14 to 18 will not be able to get a free, catch-up vaccine in the UK - but they can buy it for around \u00a3150 per dose.\n\nHealth officials say that boys are already benefitting from protection from the girls' HPV vaccination programme and this has reduced the spread of the virus.\n\nGirls can continue to have a catch-up jab up to the age of 25.\n\n'Why I paid for my son to have HPV jab'\n\nPat Heery, who works at the BBC, was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue, caused by HPV, in December. He experienced a very gruelling six months, having to have nine teeth removed even before treatment started. \n\n\"As a father of two boys who will both miss the free vaccinations, I was determined from the outset to give them every chance to not have to go through what I had to endure. \n\n\"Chemists and travel vaccination centres will vaccinate boys via a course of three injections costing around \u00a3500. \n\n\"As soon as my treatment was over, my 17-year-old son had his first dose of the vaccine, Gardasil. \n\n\"It is not cheap and I am lucky enough to be able to afford it.  \n\n\"But the thought of having to watch my sons suffer the side effects of 30 rounds of radiotherapy means I see it as money well spent.\"\n\nWhat about gay men?\n\nMen who have sex with men do not benefit in the same way from the girls' programme, so may be left unprotected from HPV.\n\nThat is why gay men up to the age of 45 can have a free HPV vaccine if they visit a sexual health clinic or their GP in the UK.\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\nDr David Elliman, immunisation expert for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he welcomed the introduction of the vaccination programme for boys.\n\n\"In time, this will lead to a significant reduction in cancers of the anus, penis and head and neck,\"he said.\n\n\"The latter is currently increasing in incidence, but this trend will be turned around as the vaccination programme takes effect in the future.\"\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, of Public Health England, said the programme could\"make HPV-related diseases a thing of the past\".\n\nPHE estimates that 85,000 cancers will be prevented in women, including 64,000 cases of cervical cancer, and 29,000 in men in the UK by 2058, thanks to the vaccine.\n\n\"I encourage all parents of eligible boys and girls to make sure they take up the offer for this potentially life-saving vaccine,\"Dr Ramsay said.\n\n\"It's important not to delay vaccination, as the vaccine may be less effective as adolescents get older.\"\n\nThe Royal College of GPs said:\"The potential of this vaccine to save lives and prevent the complications of cancer is huge, and since it has been available on the NHS for girls, it has had excellent take-up, with impressive results - it's important this success is replicated with boys.\"\n\nRobert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said the move was a\"huge leap forward\".\nTL;DR: Health officials say the HPV vaccine for 12 to 13-year-old boys, starting after the summer, will prevent 29,000 cancers in UK men in the next 40 years.\n\nArticle: By Justin ParkinsonBBC News Magazine\n\nAs airship R100 crossed the Atlantic on its maiden voyage, the captain stuck his arm out of the window. In his rubber-gloved hand was a round piece of glass.\n\nEvery three hours during the trip from England to Canada, Squadron Leader Ralph Sleigh Booth, or another member of the 44-man crew, repeated the action, for five minutes at a time. \n\nA couple of thousand feet below, a passenger on a steam ship heading in the same direction, Lester Dillon Weston, watched with great interest through a telescope pushed through his porthole. Booth was carrying out an experiment aimed at ensuring the human race could continue to feed itself. The piece of glass was a Petri dish designed to pick up spores released by a fungus known as wheat rust, which had destroyed large areas of crops in North America.\n\nCambridge University scientist Dillon Weston - a man with a passion for aviation - was keen to find out whether spores could cross the Atlantic. He decided to use airships, still at the experimental stage as passenger craft, to aid his research. \n\n\"It wasn't just Dillon Weston who benefited from this,\"says Ruth Horry, a researcher at Cambridge University's history and philosophy of science department.\"People were suffering a sort of airship fatigue in Britain. The government had spent lots of money on developing them and nothing seemed to be coming out of it.\n\n\"So the fact they could be used to aid scientific endeavour was very useful for publicity. That's why the captain took part in the experiment. It was excellent PR.\"\n\nAirships, quiet but huge, had not always been popular with Britons. Germany had used them to drop bombs on Britain during World War One. After one was shot down over Cuffley, Hertfordshire, in 1916, the pilot responsible, William Leefe Robinson, was awarded \u00a33,500 and a Victoria Cross.\n\nIn contrast, after the war, the government became involved in efforts to turn airships into luxurious passenger craft, able to compete with ocean liners and linking the British Empire more quickly. It was envisaged that they could get from England to Australia in 10 days, India in six and Canada in three. Cruising speeds were lower than those for aeroplanes but during this era using the latter was expensive and involved many stop-offs.\n\n\"The public was pretty much in favour of airships,\"says airship historian Dan Grossman.\"I don't think people were tired of them by 1930 but maybe that there was a sense that the British effort could move on a bit quicker.\"\n\nOther countries' programmes had resulted in tales of bravery which enthralled the public. In 1926, the airship Norge became the first aircraft to reach the North Pole, on an expedition organized by Norwegian Roald Amundsen and American Lincoln Ellsworth. Germany's LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin had made a five-stage flight around the world in 1929, amid huge press coverage - unsurprising as media mogul William Randolph Hearst was the tour's major backer.\n\nAirship disasters\n\nThe 720ft-long R100, built by Vickers at Howden, East Yorkshire, set off from Cardington, Bedfordshire, in July 1930. Its inflated volume was more than five million cubic feet and its construction involved 58,200ft of tubing and five million rivets.\n\nIts opulent design included a double staircase leading down to the dining room, flanked by panoramic windows, and a two-tier promenade deck. It could carry 100 passengers, sleeping in bunk beds, and had a nautical theme, with the use of portholes as windows. The official brochure described the R100 as like a\"small hotel\"and\"intermediate in comfort between a Pullman coach and ocean liner\".\n\nCosting about \u00a3450,000 to build and run, the maiden voyage coincided with Dillon Weston's trip to Canada for a year-long study of the effects of fungi on crops. \n\nDillon Weston persuaded those in charge of Sqn Ldr Booth's mission to assist his experiment. As a former member of the Cambridge University Air Squadron, he had previously badgered friends to fly around Cambridgeshire in planes to test his Vaseline-coated collection dishes. His involvement in the R100 voyage was timely for the government, as it gave it an added note of practicality.\n\n\"Devastating yet invisible plant diseases were an important enemy to conquer and new aviation technologies were vital in winning the war against them,\"says Horry.\"Newspaper coverage of the time showed that the scientist who chased invisible diseases captured both tiny spores and the imagination of the public.'Disease germs two miles up - flying scientists chase them,' declared one newspaper.\"\n\n\"No plane would have been able to carry the equipment needed for any scientific expedition across the Atlantic at that stage, so the airship was vital,\"says Grossman.\n\nDillon Weston watched some of the flight from below, but the 64mph cruising speed of the R100 was far greater than that of the Ausonia, on which he sailed. The R100 took just over three days to travel from Bedfordshire to Montreal, where 100,000 people came to see it. The Toronto Star newspaper christened it a\"wonder airship\"and the Manchester Evening News called it a\"beautiful sight, the sun glinting brilliantly\"on its hull.\n\nThe R100 was nicknamed the\"capitalist airship\"because a private firm had built it, while its sister ship, the R101, became known as the\"socialist airship\", having been constructed by the Air Ministry, although both were to transport only wealthy travellers. The R101, despite the proximity of millions of cubic feet of hydrogen, had a smoking room on the lower deck. The floor and ceiling were made of light asbestos.\n\nWhen he arrived in Canada, Dillon Weston collected the Petri dishes to analyse, for what he thought was the start of a series of experiments. But this was not what happened.\n\nOn 5 October 1930, the R101 crashed near Beauvais, northern France, en route to Karachi. The hydrogen ignited, killing 48 of the 55 passengers and crew. Among them were aviation minister Lord Thomson of Cardington, who had pushed for the government to promote airship building, and his valet.\n\nGrossman feels Thomson was partly to blame for demanding the R101's launch before sufficient testing. Having arranged an official dinner at the planned stop-off point in Ismalia, Egypt, Thomson decided against refuelling there, to avoid eating amid noxious smells. This meant overfilling the balloon, Grossman argues, meaning more rubbing on girders and hydrogen leakages. Thomson also reportedly brought a 129lb carpet and two cases of champagne, weighing 52lbs, on board.\n\nThe crash was a PR disaster, with pictures of the site splashed across newspapers and survivors appearing fully bandaged in photographs. \n\nThe British Airships Scheme was abandoned with what the historian Nick le Neve Walmsley has called\"extraordinary haste\", with the R100 being scrapped. Manned airships programmes largely ended after the German Hindenburg crashed at Lakehurst, New Jersey, in May 1937, with the loss of 35 of those on board.\n\nDillon Weston, who died in 1952, used a Bunsen burner to create glass models of the spores he analysed, which can be seen at the Whipple Museum of the History of Science in Cambridge. He never wrote his full report, not considering the evidence gained from the R100 conclusive on the movements of wheat rust spores. But Horry has used flight papers, telegrams, family letters and newspaper reports to re-trace his journey.\n\nAlthough Dillon Weston's experiment was never repeated, Horry believes its\"piggy-backing\"spirit continues in Nasa's gathering of peripheral scientific data on its missions.\"It sounds brave to stick an arm out of an airship window,\"she says.\"But really, like going into space, the brave thing was flying the airship in the first place.\"\n\nMore from the Magazine\n\nThe longest aircraft in the world has been unveiled at an airfield in Cardington, England, from where the great airships of the 1920s flew. \n\nThe world's longest aircraft in the making (February 2014)\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: Britain was seen to lag behind other countries during the global airship-building race of the 1920s and 1930s.

According to The Financial Times, the company committed more than $6bn (\u00a34.96bn) in total for original films and TV shows, including several hundred million for The Morning Show.\n\nThe Aniston series is the latest in a whole host of TV shows to take an audience behind the camera - which raises the question of why viewers find them so fascinating.\n\n(Several films have also recently tackled the subject, like 2011's Morning Glory with Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton, and Late Night starring Emma Thompson, released earlier this year.)\n\n\"We all consume TV news, but it's quite hard to actually see behind it because it has to look so professional,\"says BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty.\"But the characters you find behind the scenes are so interesting.\"\n\nOne criticism that has been levelled at dramas and sitcoms set behind the camera is that they are just navel-gazing - the media obsessed with itself yet again.\n\n\"There's always that risk,\"Munchetty says,\"But I think if you're really into politics you'll watch The Thick of It and The West Wing, and similarly if you love TV or news, you'd enjoy something like this as well. \n\n\"Look how many medical programmes there are, or shows about lawyers or the police - we're fascinated by certain industries whether we work in them or not.\"\n\nCritics have often praised these shows - albeit more so for their scripts and characterisation than their settings.\n\n\"Studio 60, like 30 Rock, is better when it's not about network television, but about the people who happen to work inside it,\"wrote Alessandra Stanley in The New York Times in 2006, the year both shows hit the airwaves.\"And at their best, the two shows are unequalled by anything else on network television.\"\n\nLooking ahead to Aniston's new show, Munchetty is confident the writers won't be short of material.\n\n\"Lots of stuff happens behind the scenes that is amusing,\"she says.\"Guests and presenters sneaking in, slurps of tea being hurriedly swallowed when it's supposed to be be our turn to talk.\n\n\"Correspondents trying to tell the story when members of the public are interfering with their job - making noise, pulling funny faces and so on.\"\n\nThe BBC Breakfast presenters themselves even have a tough time holding things together - regularly falling into fits of giggles, much to the delight of viewers.\n\nTV shows about TV shows\n\n\"Sometimes the audience catches our slip-ups and likes to get a bit of insight - the ability to roll with the mistakes makes the job easier,\"Munchetty says.\n\n\"In fact, one of the things I learned was if you make a mistake, you laugh it off, because we're all human, and it can often seem like people reading the news are one step removed from everyone else.\"\n\nThe questions presenters get asked every day by members of the public are perhaps proof of how interested viewers are in the process of putting TV shows together.\n\n\"'What time do you wake up? Who's your favourite person to work with? What time do you go to bed?' People love to know the most difficult guests and things like that,\"Munchetty laughs.\n\nBut presenting a TV news programme is a lot harder than it looks, she adds.\n\n\"This new series would need to show that it understands how much work is needed to be able to appear breezy and relaxed first thing in the morning,\"says Munchetty. \n\n\"If you know your stuff you can be very relaxed. You're never allowed to moan about being tired - everyone there is so there's no point talking about it.\"\n\nMunchetty jokes there would be a fair few storylines to be written about\"guests who turn it on for the camera but off camera are as cold as ice\".\n\nOne trap that shows based in newsrooms can easily fall into is presenting a sanitised version of a job that isn't as glamorous as it looks.\n\nThe Guardian's Brian Moylan was among the critics who felt HBO's The Newsroom was a little preachy and idealistic.\"The problem with Sorkin's fatally flawed mission is that it could never exist in the real world,\"he wrote. \n\nMunchetty herself points out that one of the many pitfalls a show like this could fall into would be for it to\"become farcical\". \n\n\"Don't forget we are journalists and have to cover serious stories every day,\"she says.\n\n\"We are one of the first sources of news for families and must make sure we are accurate, accessible and timely. We have to finely balance the need to be serious and fun - not always easy as we are led by the news of the day.\n\n\"As breakfast presenters, we're part of people's lives. We are there while the audience is getting on with their day, while they have their routine, and so you have to be really aware that people feel they know you.\"\n\nAsked whether she might watch Aniston's new show, she jokes:\"Yes - as long as is not on too late in the evening!\"\n\nAn earlier version of this article appeared in August 2017, when The Morning Show was first commissioned. \n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He met the future Mrs Lyon when she joined his team as a project co-ordinator. After three or four months, they got together at an office function.\n\n\"I always liked her and she made it known that she liked me as well,\"he said.\"It went from there.\"\n\nAt the time, he was 41 and she was 14 years younger. They initially kept the relationship secret, but eventually made it known that they were an item.\n\n\"You don't believe it's an issue for other people, but it transpires that it is, and you don't see why, because it doesn't impact your work,\"he says.\n\n\"You spend a lot of time with people at work, so you get to know them quite well.\"\n\nAfter the couple had been seeing each other for about three months, he was called in and, as he puts it:\"Then the hammer dropped.\"\n\nHe lost his job, but she kept hers.\"She was pretty upset, but there's not much you can do. You've just got to keep going.\"\n\nMr Lyon says there was no clear workplace code in place about dating colleagues. He describes the decision as\"very arbitrary\"and says it represents\"a very archaic view of the world\".\n\n\"Should managers be banned from dating subordinates? Not if it is consensual,\"he says.\n\n\"You can't choose where you find love, so why penalise both parties by firing one of them?\"\n\nHuman passions\n\nAccording to various studies, between a quarter and a third of all long-term relationships start at work.\n\nBut of course, not all liaisons between co-workers are long-term. Some are flings, affairs, one-night stands - whatever you want to call them.\n\nAnd a number of high-profile cases serve as a reminder of just how tricky life can get when human passions collide with corporate culture:\n\nAt the same time, the sexual harassment allegations against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein have made HR departments wary of any sexual activity between staff, especially in the US.\n\nHowever, Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says only a minority of employers have specific stand-alone policies on relationships at work.\n\n\"Most employers tend to take a different approach,\"he says.\"They will have policies on dignity and respect at work and preventing bullying and sexual harassment, setting out clear policies for dealing with complaints about inappropriate behaviour.\"\n\nMr Willmott points out that under the Human Rights Act in the UK, employees have a right to privacy and a family life, so firms need to strike a balance.\n\n\"If you have a very prescriptive approach, it can suggest that you don't trust your employees to act as adults in the workplace,\"he says.\n\nAmorous advances\n\nOf course, there is the potential for conflicts of interest if staff are not careful.\n\n\"If one of the parties in the relationship is responsible for the other's appraisals, pay reviews, promotion opportunities and even work allocation, then there is danger of favouritism and from team members, perceived bias,\"says Rebecca Thornley-Gibson, partner at City of London law firm DMH Stallard.  \n\n\"There may also be issues where the more junior employee feels as though they cannot say no to amorous advances, and this creates a real risk of later sexual harassment claims against the manager and employer.\"\n\nStopping relationships is not likely to be practical for employers, she says, but having policies to minimise any fallout from the relationship should be considered. \n\n\"This will involve having in place and communicating workplace policies on conduct at work, equality and diversity policies with a clear zero-tolerance towards sexual harassment, and also requiring employees to declare relationships that are likely to result in a potential conflict.\"\nTL;DR: Australian businessman Gary Lyon still thinks it was \"bizarre\" that he lost his senior management job for dating a junior colleague.\n\nArticle: It may be a hard life battling the raw cold and the long watches, but Trevor has never regretted the life of a skipper.\n\nNever that is until last week when he and his brothers were forced to tie-up right in the middle of the main whitefish season.\n\nThe reason is cod quota and the fact that the local fleet has now used up its meagre allocation for the year.\n\nUnable to land any more cod, Trevor is forced to stay in port.\n\nHis boat, the Silver Sea, now lies alongside the wall and Trevor says it's now the end of the line for what remains of a once proud white fish fleet.\n\nJust over a decade ago Northern Ireland had a fleet of 40 boats fishing for cod, haddock and whiting.\n\nConstant quota reductions and restrictions on days at sea has decimated the fleet which numbered just four boats at the beginning of this year.\n\nNo future\n\nAnd now comes what could be the final crisis moment.\n\nThe annual cod quota is now exhausted and that means the remainder of the fleet now seems to have no future.\n\nIn the past some white fish boats have turned to the prawn fishery, but Trevor McKee says that's not an option for the Silver Sea which can burn as much as 1,200 pounds of fuel a day.\n\nNeither would moving to somewhere like the North Sea be viable as that would involve leasing quota at prohibitive rates.\n\nTrevor had hoped his seven-year-old son might one day join him at sea but that now seems unlikely.\n\nHe says his only hope is that he can convince the marine scientists and fishery administrators to grant him a special scientific quota to allow him to prove that cod are actually plentiful in the Irish sea.\n\nLike many fishermen he passionately believes the scientists are failing to measure the true strength of the cod population in the Irish sea.\n\nFor now though the Silver Sea lies tied up against the harbour wall while Trevor and his brothers fear this is the end

She died in July, aged 26.\n\nWriting in her diary, she said:\"If you feel weird, go to your doctor!\"\n\n\"I was so naive when it came to healthcare, so carefree I never felt the need to see the doctor, [and was] silly for letting my mind think nothing serious could actually happen to me,\"she added.\n\n\"I finally smelt the coffee. \n\n\"No matter how little or small your problem, you make sure you get your arse down there and keep going if they send you packing.  \n\n\"Let's get educated, help our young as well as old and keep beating cancer.\"\n\n'Back and forth to GP'\n\nHer mother Ram Waltho-Brar said her\"determined\"daughter, an apprentice hairdresser and photographer, often joked that she never got ill.\n\n\"She was very fun-loving, outgoing, she was always cracking jokes and had a great sense of humour,\"she said of Neepy, who was 22 when she first experienced pain in her foot in March 2017.\n\nThe family said the doctor suggested it was down to to her being on her feet all day at the salon, but the pain increased, and spread to her leg and back.\n\n\"She went back and forth to the doctor for 10 months, and she was told she had sciatica,\"said Ms Waltho-Brar.\n\n\"She was given some exercises and was taking stronger painkillers. \n\n\"She knew in the back of her mind it wasn't right.\"\n\nSymptoms to look out for\n\nSource: Teenage Cancer Trust \n\nIn April 2018, Neepy woke up in\"tremendous pain\"and went to accident and emergency, where she was given pain relief. \n\nBut Ms Waltho-Brar said it took a third visit for a different doctor to listen to their concerns and refer her for an MRI scan.\n\n\"We knew it wasn't going to be good news,\"she said.\n\n\"I said to Neepy'let's be strong. Whatever this is we will tackle this together. You're not on your own'.\n\n\"We were then told she had cancer, and that's when everything came crashing down.\"\n\nMs Waltho-Brar said she wanted young people and healthcare professionals to familiarise themselves better with the symptoms of cancer.\n\n\"If you know something is wrong, you have to demand to be seen, to kick down doors.\n\n\"I knew I had to do something - at first for my daughter's sake, and now for others - this cannot happen.\"\n\nNeepy was diagnosed with stage 4 Ewing Sarcoma of the pelvis, resulting in 26 rounds of chemotherapy starting in May 2018 and weeks of radiotherapy.\n\nShe had further treatment when a growth was detected in her lung in January 2019, and Neepy was advised the cancer was not shrinking and she should live her life to the fullest.\n\n\"She didn't even have the chance to freeze her eggs before treatment, there just wasn't the time and that was devastating,\"said Ms Walthro-Brar. \n\n\"The prognosis could have been different, if it had been detected at stage 1 they could've removed the tumour and she could've lived another 20 years.\"\n\n'Difference between life and death'\n\nDr Louise Soanes, director of services at Teenage Cancer Trust which supported Neepy, said:\"Cancer is thankfully rare in teenagers and young adults, accounting for just 1% of all cancer diagnoses. \n\n\"However, because cancer is less common in this age group, they often have to visit their doctor numerous times before they get a [correct] diagnosis. \n\n\"Symptoms of cancer can be wide-ranging - from persistent pain and lumps and bumps to unexplained bruising - and young people can see their doctor with one, or several signs.  \n\n\"Diagnosing cancer early can have a significant impact on a young person's life. It can be the difference between life and death.\"\n\nFind BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

You're not doing anything for yourself. It was depressing, draining and sad.\"\n\nCamila Cabello was the first to quit, allegedly on bad terms. The rest of the band struggled through one last album before announcing an\"indefinite hiatus\"last March.\n\nAll five members have since released solo material, with Jauregui's fierce-yet-vulnerable Expectations among the best of the bunch; showcasing the 22-year-old's husky voice against a simple guitar riff.\n\nBut she only managed to record it after a confusing and painful period in the musical wilderness.\n\n\"The industry clouds your soul,\"Jauregui tells the BBC.\"They make you feel like you have to be a certain way to be accepted, and I got lost in that.\n\n\"I had been pushed a psyche [mindset] of what successful music sounded like - so I had this backwards concept of what I thought was good for me, commercially.\"\n\nThe situation became so bad that the musician stopped writing, and even listening to, music.\n\n\"Then, as soon as the group dissolved and we started to go our separate ways, it cleared a lot of blockages from my heart,\"she says.  \n\n\"I started getting back into music that I actually liked.\"\n\nShe delved into the albums that inspired her as a teenager - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, Songs In A Minor by Alicia Keys - and began to figure out her own sound.\n\n\"Last year was super-challenging in the sense of ripping away all the things that weren't me any more and allowing myself to come through that. \n\n\"I was like,'Do you know what? I have to pull back. I like more organic sounding things, I like live instruments, I like writing lyrics that come straight from the heart.'\"\n\nOne of the first songs she wrote in that frame of mind was Expectations, which quickly established itself as the perfect debut single. \n\n\"I went on tour with Halsey - and that was one of the songs I had in my setlist. When I sang it for the first time in Sao Paolo, it was completely unreleased [but] by the end of the song they were singing the words back to me. \n\n\"English isn't their first language in Brazil, so I was floored by the response. That's why I chose it.\"\n\nMighty Aphrodite\n\nJauregui started 2019 by following Expectations up with More Than That - a sassy, assertive takedown of a wannabe lover.\n\n\"You gon' have to come stronger than this liquor/ Wanna take me home, better be more convincing / It'll take more than that to get to me,\"she sings over a slick trap beat.\n\nHammering home her messages of feminine power and self-worth, Jauregui recreates Botticelli's iconic 15th Century painting The Birth of Venus in the artwork.\n\nThe video, meanwhile, sees her playing Aphrodite, who comes to earth and visits a strip club (stick with us here) in a celebration of womanhood.\n\n\"It's about taking that kind of rap video imagery and empowering the women who do this work,\"she explains.\n\n\"They're stripping, but each woman's spirit is captured in a way that's revering her strength and her sensuality.\"\n\nHaving dreamt up the video concept and cast the models, Jauregui found herself in awe of their athleticism.\n\n\"It was amazing. The number of hours they were doing these tricks and twirling and carving the pole. You'd think they'd be all oiled up - but they have to be completely dry, with chalk on their hands, so they can do their work. \n\n\"I was grateful we could capture that and really highlight them. They're the centrepiece of the video for me.\"\n\nAnd did she pick up any tips? \n\n\"Any tips?!\"she laughs heartily.\"Well, yeah, just by watching them. The way they used their bodies is so mesmerising.\"\n\nFighting'hate rhetoric'\n\nJauregui, who was born in Miami to Cuban parents, came out as bisexual in a powerful column for Billboard magazine in 2016, which she wrote as an angry response to Donald Trump's election victory. \n\n\"If I could tell every Trump supporter two things, it would be to travel and read a history book,\"she wrote.\"Realise that your white skin is the result of immigration from Europe, that the only true'Americans' are Native Americans. None of us belong here but all of us deserve the right to feel safe and live our lives in peace.\"\n\nTwo years into Trump's presidency, she's still exasperated (\"every day something ignorant comes out of his mouth\") but determined to turn her anger into something more positive.\n\n\"We're all becoming aware of how atrocious the hate rhetorics are, and how destructive they are to humanity but instead of just trashing what's going on - which I did for a while - I've shifted my focus into a more productive energy, of how can I convince people to get together and uplift each other.\"\n\nOutside of her music, she's leveraged her 10 million social media followers to campaign for gun reform and LGBT rights; and partnered with Amnesty International's Write For Rights campaign, encouraging people to contact government officials in support of female human rights activists who find themselves in danger.\n\nWas she warned against making political statements when she was in Fifth Harmony?\n\n\"Of course people advised me against it,\"she says. \n\n\"When you're working in any industry that has to do with making people like you, they're going to advise you against saying things that would turn anyone off. \n\n\"But I just happen to have a very powerful voice. I articulate myself well when I write and when I speak, so if God gave me that power, I have to use it.\"\n\nHer beliefs have permeated her music - most notably on Strangers, a tumultuous LGBT duet from Halsey's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom album - but Jauregui says her debut album will be more personal than political.\n\n\"That's just who I am. I'm a deeply emotional thinker, so a lot of my music is reflective of coming of age and finding yourself and clearing out the clutter in your heart.\n\n\"But I think that's ok. I want to be someone who is about love and acceptance, no matter where you come from, no matter how you look, no matter what your story is. \n\n\"I want you to feel loved and heard and seen, through my music and through my energy.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He died as a result of his stab wounds.\n\n'Great shock'\n\nHe was the twin of Abdullah, 18, and brother of Jaffar, 17, both from Brighton, who were said to have become radicalised and died fighting with Islamists in Syria in 2014.\n\nHis father, Abubaker, said his son had been stabbed in the back and thigh and the family, now in mourning, had suffered\"a great shock\".\n\nMr Deghayes' twin and his younger brother fought for an Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group in Syria, following in the footsteps of their older brother, Amer.\n\nIt is believed Amer is still alive in Syria, having left Sussex in 2013.\n\nMr Deghayes, who was jailed in 2017 for drug dealing, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital following the crash at 21:30 GMT on Saturday near St Joseph's Church, Elm Grove.\n\nPolice said there had been a disturbance in Wellington Road, Brighton, where it is believed Mr Deghayes was stabbed.\n\nMr Deghayes then got into the car, which was driven to Elm Grove before it collided with other vehicles.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nSussex Police\nTL;DR: A second man has been arrested in Brighton on suspicion of murdering the brother of two young men who died fighting for Islamists in Syria.\n\nArticle: By Alex TaylorBBC News\n\nThe career-spanning sets, complete with the surprise reformation of Destiny's Child to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary, saw #Beychella trend online in admiration for the past two weekends.\n\nEven a series of second week blunders, including an on-stage fall between Beyonce and her sister Solange, as well as the perils of a faulty stage fan, failed to tarnish the spectacle that stretched far beyond music.\n\n\"The word'iconic' only begins to scratch the surface of how black America felt when an unapologetic black woman, born and raised in the belly of the south, headlined one of the whitest music festivals in America,\"Kristi Henderson, a senior member at Colour of Change - America's largest online racial justice organisation.\n\nOver the fortnight the pop superstar paid homage to the landmark occasion by infusing her performance with black power symbolism. \n\nIn doing so, Henderson told BBC News that Beyonce\"echoed the resilience of a people who continue to be criminalised and persecuted for sitting, standing, walking, talking, laughing, thinking, riding in cars, breathing and for being black in America\".\n\nThe 36-year-old singer - a strong civil rights advocate and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement - collaborated with Olivier Rousteing, creative director of French fashion house Balmain, to produce the politically-charged costume designs.\n\nHere, we take a look at what the symbols meant and represent.\n\nQueen Nefertiti\n\nThe centrepiece outfit across both weeks was a headdress and full-body costume inspired by Queen Nefertiti. One of the most powerful women of ancient Egypt, Nefertiti is a historic symbol of black female empowerment and was influential during the reign of her husband Pharaoh Akhenaten in the 14th Century BC. \n\nAlthough thought to be one of many wives, Nefertiti held elevated status.   \n\nThe second weekend saw Beyonce embodying Nefertiti with a different - equally striking - headdress and cape combination.\n\nRenowned for her beauty (her name translates as\"the beautiful one has come\"), she was viewed as the link between human citizens and the deified Sun God Aten. Her power, status and independence made her an iconic figure.\n\nFredara Hadley, a visiting professor at Oberlin College, Ohio, says Nefertiti - along with Cleopatra and the Queen of Sheba - are historical figures who have\"come to represent a regal African past for black Americans\".\n\n\"Beyonce is on this really interesting journey of revisiting different eras of black womanhood - 19th/early 20th Century rural black women in Lemonade, black Madonna in her 2017 Grammy performance, and Nefertiti at Coachella,\"Hadley adds.\n\nThe first headdress worn by Beyonce, decorated with a black feather, reflects the bust of Nefertiti discovered in 1912, pictured above.\n\nSpeaking to Vogue, Rousteing said Jay Z's\"eyes went wide\"when he saw Beyonce in the accompanying goddess cape.\n\nBeyonce changed costumes five times during both performances, and saved the most overt political imagery for a vest top adorned with a shield made up of key black power symbols.\n\nRaised fist:\n\nThis referenced the silent protest against racial discrimination made by black American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico Olympics.\n\nThe pair, who won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200m, stood with their heads bowed and black-gloved hands raised as the American national anthem played.\n\nSmith said he had raised his right fist to represent black power in America, while Carlos raised his left fist to represent black unity. \n\nBlack Panther logo:\n\nIn the 1960s, the fist salute became a symbol of black power militant groups in the US like the Black Panther Party, which carried out armed citizens' patrols to monitor police behaviour in California in the 1960s.\n\nBeyonce referenced this militant group in her 2013 NFL Super Bowl performance. Dressed in black leather and black berets, the singers and dancers raised fists into the air during the show, mimicking the Black Panthers' salute.\n\nBlack bee:\n\nThe bee motif symbolised her fans, known as the Beyhive.\n\nEye of Horus:\n\nThis Egyptian symbol represents inner enlightenment and self-awareness. \n\nErik Steinskog, a professor in cultural studies at the University of Copenhagen, who made headlines last year by offering a degree in Beyonce, told the BBC this also points to Afrofuturism.\n\nThis paints ancient Egypt as an African high-culture\"different than, in opposition to, and, historically'before' Eurocentric Western thinking\", he says.\n\n\"She clearly highlights black culture and celebrates it - perhaps more in her first Coachella performance than in any other performance,\"he adds.\n\nThroughout the initial set, Beyonce and her backing dancers frequently wore sorority-style black and yellow clothing. \n\nThis served as a nod to historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) - institutions of higher education in the United States established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to serve the black community that was shut out by predominantly white institutions. \n\nThe colour scheme specifically referenced the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, established at Cornell University in 1906, as the first black inter-college fraternity - boasting Frederick Douglas, Martin Luther King and Jesse Owens as members.  \n\nBut Beyonce added her own twist, turning her Coachella set into an oath of allegiance to her own fictitious sorority called Beta Delta Kappa, the initials emblazoned on her cropped hoodie.\n\nThe yellow colour was ditched in the second weekend's performance for an equally eye-catching magenta colourway to close show.\n\nIn these clothes, Beyonce sang Lift Every Voice And Sing!, a hymn of black empowerment.\n\n\"While many in the mostly white crowd cheered for what they believed was an exclusive debut of Beyonce's'newest' record, it was, in fact, the negro national anthem,\"says Henderson.\n\nSo it was a\"freedom cry\"to black Americans who\"remain underrepresented, ridden with lynching, racial injustices, and violence\".\n\n\"I hope the world simultaneously pays it due respect to the rich black culture, faithful black elders and ancestors who live through Beyonce,\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

We also hope that once again parents of pre-schoolers over two get them vaccinated at their GP's surgery.\"\n\nThe PHA said all at-risk children should continue to receive the flu vaccine as they have done in previous years. \n\nSchool children will receive letters and consent forms over the next couple of months.\n\nThe extended flu vaccination programme is being phased in over several years and will eventually cover all children aged between two and 16 years.\nTL;DR: Children, aged two and over, and all primary school children will be offered the flu vaccination from Thursday.\n\nArticle: What is his connection with technology?\n\nHe sits on Facebook's board and runs several firms that fund start-ups. He helped set up Paypal and is seen as one of the smartest readers of tech trends in Silicon Valley. He has the clout Trump needed to get chief executives to show up. \n\nSo he was a coder from an early age?\n\nNot really. Official biographies do not talk about him being a precocious coder; instead he spent his time on maths and chess. He beat every other kid in California on a maths test given to high schoolers. Aged 12, he ranked seventh in the whole country in the under-13 category for chess players.\n\nHe does have some knowledge though, because in 2012 he taught an undergraduate course at Stanford about computer history and start-up advice.\n\nHow did he get into tech?\n\nIt took a while. He studied philosophy and law at Stanford University and then briefly worked as a  commodities lawyer. After that he traded derivatives at Credit Suisse for three years. In 1996, he quit and moved to California just as the net started its meteoric ascent.\n\nSeeing an opportunity, he scraped together $1m and looked for ideas to invest in. Confinity, which handled net-based payments, was one of the first. It gave rise to an offshoot called Paypal, sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn.\n\nSoon after, he made another good bet by making an angel investment of $500,000 in Facebook. \n\nWhy do some of the firms he has founded have strange names?\n\nBecause he is a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings. So far, he has set up six firms (Palantir, Valar Ventures, Mithril Capital, Lembas LLC, Rivendell LLC and Arda Capital) that take their names from Tolkien's creation.\n\nWhere does the link with politics come in?\n\nIt's always been there. He read Ayn Rand in high school and admired Ronald Reagan at the same time. At Stanford he founded a conservative newspaper and sought work with several Supreme Court justices. Also, while a derivatives trader, he was a speechwriter for a former US secretary of education. He quit his job as a lawyer and trader because neither fulfilled his urge to make a difference - both of which could be seen as political decisions.\n\nHe has used his money for explicitly political ends. In 2012-13, he gave $10m to wrestler Hulk Hogan to help sue media news site Gawker, which had made public a sex tape involving Mr Hogan. Gawker lost the legal battle and shut down as a result. Mr Thiel is believed to have given the cash because in 2007 Gawker outed him as being gay.\n\nWhat is his political stance?\n\nIt's complicated. He is apparently influenced by libertarian thinkers who favour smaller government and greater individual liberty. In a manifesto he published in 2009, he declared that freedom and democracy were incompatible. \n\nFor Mr Thiel, politics is too mired in the present to do any good. Instead, he wrote, only technology can make a difference in the world. He has backed up these words through the Thiel Foundation, which has given cash to tech firms working on breakthroughs such as extending life, living on the sea and making machines truly intelligent.\n\nHow did he hook up with Donald Trump?\n\nThat's even more complicated. There are some clues in the speech Mr Thiel gave to the Republican Convention earlier this year. In that, he said neither he nor Donald Trump were politicians but they were both\"builders\"and wanted to use those skills to rebuild a\"broken\"America.\n\nThat speech pointed out that a lot of the money made in America over the past few decades had gone to relatively few people. The majority had seen no benefits from that wealth. \n\nFew people were being honest about America's problems, said Mr Thiel.\n\nBut, as others have pointed out, while Mr Thiel may have put his finger on some of the issues facing America, it is not clear why he thought Donald Trump would be able to solve them. \n\nDoes his involvement with the Trump presidency end with this meeting?\n\nNo. Mr Thiel is believed to have become a key member of the Trump transition team. In addition, employees from Mr Thiel's venture capital fund and staff at some of the firms he founded have also been seconded to work with Mr Trump.\n\nIt is not clear what policy areas Mr Thiel and others will be advising on though it is likely to concern regulatory matters and industrial policy. As a man who has a\"talent for making big, contrarian bets\"it will be interesting to see how this one plays out.\nTL;DR: Bosses of big US technology firms met the president-elect at Trump Tower on Wednesday. Many of the chief execs were persuaded to attend by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who has become Mr Trump's go-to man when it comes to technology. But how did he go from tech investor to key Trump adviser?\n\nArticle: The Kymin Round House in Monmouth attracts 65,000 people a year to a site Lord Horatio Nelson visited in 1802 and which has a naval monument.\n\nBut because of losses suffered because of the coronavirus pandemic, its reopening has been paused.\n\nIt will be the first time since 1902 it has not had a custodian on site.\n\nMartin Kerrigan, who has lived with his wife, Sara Szwer, at the site for 17 years, said:\"The proposal is to make us redundant which would mean we would have to move out of the house on the site.\"\n\nHe said he was concerned about the Kymin's long-term future, adding:\"It is a real local landmark and an icon for the town of Monmouth.\"\n\nVisitors follow in the footsteps of Lord Horatio Nelson, who dined in the Round House in 1802, while the Naval Temple was built in 1801 as a monument.\n\nThere are currently 13 weddings, some postponed because of coronavirus, booked for next year, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nMonmouth councillor Richard Roden said residents in the town were\"shocked\"at the possibility of custodians being removed.\n\n\"They play an essential role in keeping the property and area safe for the community and visitors to one of Monmouth's top visitor attractions,\"he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Trust said the charity faced losses of \u00a3200m as a result of coronavirus and had to review every aspect of its work and\"as a result we propose to make savings in almost every area of activity\".\n\nAt the Kymin, she said the current proposal was to\"pause reopening and rethink the visitor offer\", adding:\"This means it is unlikely to reopen in the immediate future.\"\nTL;DR: Wales' first National Trust site is set to close \"for the immediate future\", with its custodians losing their jobs and home.\n\nArticle: Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust says more than 200 patients have tested positive for coronavirus - 16 are in a critical condition.\n\nThe\"dramatic increase\"in patients comes as Nottingham could be going into tier three lockdown. \n\nThe trust said\"a full ward of people\"with Covid were being admitted daily.\n\nAccording to the latest NHS England data, an average of 14 people a day were admitted to the Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital with Covid-19 in the week up to 20 October. \n\nAn average of seven people were on mechanical ventilation a day. \n\nChief executive Tracy Taylor said as a result of the increased Covid and\"normal winter emergency pressures\"meant some non-urgent surgeries would need to be postponed until at least 6 November. \n\nShe said:\"This is not a decision we have taken lightly but we need to ensure we have the beds and staff available to care for those in urgent need during this surge of Covid-19.\n\n\"This is a challenging situation but we are working with our colleagues across Nottinghamshire's Integrated Care System to do the best for our patients.\"\n\nOfficials in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire are in discussions about whether the areas will move into tier three restrictions.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a meeting between local leaders and a government minister concluded without a definite decision being made. \n\nMore talks are expected to be held later.\n\nIt follows news Nottingham's seven-day coronavirus infection rate had fallen again.\n\nThe latest figures show the seven-day infection rate in Nottingham is 561.4 per 100,000 people, the fifth highest in England.

If past practice is followed, this will have been a test. \n\nAssuming it has gone satisfactorily, the rover will then acquire a second drill sample for ingesting in the robot's on-board laboratories.\n\nCuriosity last used its drill in May last year in a small depression not far from its August 2012 landing site.\n\nThe samples pulled up from mudstones at the bottom of this shallow bowl contained evidence of an ancient lake.\n\nFrom the rock chemistry, scientists were able to determine the type of environment that existed in Gale Crater billions of years ago.\n\nThe researchers said the conditions would have allowed micro-organisms to flourish had they been present. \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: The US space agency's Curiosity Mars rover has drilled another hole on the Red Planet.\n\nArticle: David Strang said the evidence was clear that such sentences did not cut crime and called for a\"more creative approach\"to community-based options.\n\nSince 2010 the Scottish courts have operated a presumption against prison sentences of three months or less.\n\nThe Scottish government has yet to publish its response to a consultation on increasing that to 12 months.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Strang, who was formerly the chief constable of Lothian and Borders Police, said sending more people to jail to serve shorter sentences would result in reconviction rates spiralling as well as an increase in offending.\n\nHe said:\"The evidence is very clear that if you want to reduce crime then you don't send people to prison for a short time.\n\n\"People who are released from a short sentence of less than 12 months, over half of them are reconvicted within one year.\n\n\"So I would have thought that one purpose of the criminal justice system is to prevent future crimes, to reduce reoffending, and that if you send someone to prison then the damage that that does leads to them reoffending more than if you had given them an alternative.\"\n\nMr Strang called for a more creative approach to community-based alternatives to prison, including fines and payback orders, which he said were much cheaper and far more effective.\n\n'Punitive attitude'\n\nHe said that keeping a convict in prison for a year costs between \u00a330,000-40,000 in Scotland, whereas a community payback order costs less than \u00a310,000 a year.\n\nThe Scottish courts have a presumption against imposing prison sentences of three months or less unless it can be shown that no other alternative is appropriate.\n\nMr Strang said he understood that ministers were inclined to back plans to increase the period to 12 months.\n\nHe added:\"I think there is quite a punitive attitude in Scotland in that somehow people feel that unless someone is sent to prison then they haven't really been dealt with properly for their crime.\n\n\"It's really important to get the message over that that's not the case. We should only be imprisoning people who need to be for the sake of either the seriousness of the offence that they've committed or particularly to protect the public from harm.\"\n\n'Important role'\n\nScottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said:\"Short-term prison sentences can play an important role in our justice system, and it would be ludicrous to end them.\n\n\"We cannot fetter judges' discretion without full consideration of the consequences and wider policy context.\n\n\"There are many offences and circumstances where a custodial sentence of up to 12 months could be an appropriate punishment, and we need to allow judges the choice to hand down such sentences if they deem it necessary.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said the prison population remained\"unacceptably high\"and that it was setting out plans to invest in community sentences and electronic monitoring. \n\nHe added:\"We have consistently stated that the consultation responses on extending the presumption against short prison sentences would inform our decisions and it is only right that we take the time to consider these views. \n\n\"We'll continue to discuss how best to take this forward with the relevant stakeholders. \n\n\"There will, however, always be some crimes where a custodial sentence is absolutely justified.\"\nTL;DR: Scotland's chief inspector of prisons has called for an end to jail terms of less than 12 months.\n\nArticle: By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter \n\nThe report estimates that hepatitis infections and their complications led to 1.45m deaths in 2013 - despite the existence of vaccines and treatments.\n\nWorld Health Organization data shows there were 1.2m Aids-related deaths in 2014, while TB led to 1.5m deaths.\n\nThe WHO has put forward a global strategy to tackle hepatitis. \n\n'Startling findings'\n\nResearchers say these plans must be put into action urgently to tackle the crisis. \n\nViral hepatitis refers to five different forms of virus (known as A, B, C, D, E) - some can be spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and others (A and E) through contaminated food or water. \n\nMost deaths worldwide are due to B and C, which can cause serious liver damage and predispose people to liver cancer. But because people don't always feel the symptoms of the initial infection, they can be unaware of the long-term damage until it is too late. \n\nScientists from Imperial College London and the University of Washington examined data from 183 countries, collected between 1990 and 2013.\n\nThey found the the number of deaths linked to viral hepatitis rose by more than 60% over two decades - partly due to a growing population.\n\nDeaths from diseases such as TB and malaria have dropped.\n\nDr Graham Cooke of Imperial College London described the findings as startling. \n\nHe said:\"Although there are effective treatments and vaccines for viral hepatitis, there is very little money invested in getting these to patients - especially compared to malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB.\n\n\"We have tools at our disposal to treat this disease - we have vaccines to treat hepatitis A and B and we have new treatments for C. \n\n\"However the price of new medicines is beyond the reach of any country - rich or poor.\"\n\nThe study suggests the problem is biggest in East Asia. \n\nBut unlike many other diseases, deaths from viral hepatitis were higher in high and middle income countries than in lower income nations.\n\nThe WHO hepatitis strategy, which was put forward in May 2016,  includes targets to reduce new cases of hepatitis B and C by 30% by 2020, alongside a 10% reduction in mortality.\n\nThe WHO says countries and organisations will need to expand vaccination programmes, focus on preventing mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and increase access to treatment for hepatitis B and C, to help ensure these targets are met.\nTL;DR: Viral hepatitis is one of the leading killers across the globe, with a death toll that matches Aids or tuberculosis, research in the Lancet suggests.\n\nArticle: The airport operator said 8.6 million passengers used its six UK airports in the month.\n\nBAA said\"a substantial proportion\"of pre-Easter traffic fell in March whereas it fell in April last year.\n\nBAA operates Heathrow, Stansted, Southampton, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports.\n\nHowever, it plans to sell Edinburgh after the Competition Commission told it to sell one of its Scottish hubs.\n\nThe UK's busiest airport, Heathrow, saw 5.7 million passengers pass through its terminals in March, a rise of 6.9% on the year.\n\nThat meant that the London airport saw more than 70 million passengers over a 12-month period for the first time, which BAA called a\"major milestone\".\n\nAberdeen saw a 10.2% rise in passenger numbers, while Glasgow saw a 4.6% rise.\n\nHowever, numbers fell at Stansted (-4.7%), Southampton (-1.7%) and Edinburgh (-2.8%).\nTL;DR: The number of passengers travelling through BAA's airports in March rose by 4% on the previous year, thanks largely to Easter falling earlier in 2012.\n\nArticle: The jacking frame that surrounded the slender i360 seafront structure as it was constructed has been removed.\n\nThe 162m (531ft) tower is made up of 17 tubes stacked on top of each other.\n\nImages of the observation pod that will take people up to a height of 138m (453ft) have also been revealed by developers.\n\n'Engineering marvel'\n\nThe i360 has been designed by the team behind the London Eye.\n\nThe pod, which will carry up to 200 people, is currently being constructed near Lyon, France.\n\nDevelopers hope the tower will attract at least 700,000 visitors per year, making it the city's most popular paid-for attraction.\n\nChief executive of the Brighton i360, Eleanor Harris, said:\"It is incredible to see the tower standing without the jacking tower. \n\n\"Now you get a real sense of why the i360 is the slimmest tall tower ever built in the world; it is a real marvel of engineering.\"\nTL;DR: Brighton has been given its first clear glimpse of England's tallest viewing platform outside London.\n\nArticle: Footage shows members of the band, which became famous after performing a protest song in a church against President Vladimir Putin, being beaten.\n\nPolice questioned witnesses, but no-one was arrested.\n\nOn Monday, two band members were arrested on suspicion of theft at Sochi, but later released.\n\nThe footage shows Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, who both served prison sentences for their Moscow church performance, being attacked along with other band members.\n\nA Cossack appears to spray a substance in the face of one of the band members, who were wearing ski-masks.\n\nAn officer with a whip then proceeds to attack the band members along with a man with a camera.\n\nOther Cossacks then jump in, punching the band members and throwing them to the floor.\n\n'Political event'\n\nThe group has been fiercely critical of President Putin, who has been the main driving force behind the Sochi Games.\n\nOne band member said on Tuesday that the Sochi Games were a political event.\n\n\"Now there is an occupation of this territory, because the city is under total police and security control,\"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have arrived here on Sunday [and] we are being detained all the time. Even when we were driving our car and walking in the street. So they are looking for any reasons to arrest us.\"\n\nMs Tolokonnikova said they were detained for 10 hours by police on Monday after arriving\"to make a political claim about the Sochi Olympics\".  \n\nEarlier this month, six members of Pussy Riot signed an open letter insisting that Ms Alyokhina and Ms Tolokonnikova should no longer be described as members of the punk rock collective.\n\nThe remaining members of the group said the pair had forgotten about the\"aspirations and ideals of our group\"and were wrong to appear at an Amnesty International concert in New York.\nTL;DR: Russian protest group Pussy Riot have been beaten with horsewhips by Cossacks who are helping patrol Sochi during the Winter Olympics.\n\nArticle: Mr Crabb told MPs that he wants to publish\"a set of commitments\"on transferring further powers to Wales.\n\nHe said he hoped to free up more space in Welsh political discourse to debate issues that matter more to voters.\n\nOn Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said discussions about Wales' future powers should be completed by January.\n\nMr Jones was speaking in a debate in which all four parties in the assembly backed a joint motion calling for the Welsh and UK governments to agree by then much extra funding Wales needs.\n\nThe motion also urged UK ministers to devolve further tax-varying powers and to establish a new system intended to make it clearer what powers the assembly holds.\n\nAddressing the Welsh affairs committee at Westminster on Wednesday, Mr Crabb said he could not remember anyone\"on the doorstep\"raising the question of devolution with him.\n\nHe said he hoped the commitments on transferring further powers would demonstrate to Wales\"a cross-party consensus on a way forward for Welsh devolution\".\n\nIn October, Mr Crabb said he had agreed with Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats to develop plans demonstrating\"that we're serious about strengthening devolution and making it work for all the people\".\nTL;DR: Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has set a deadline of St David's Day next year - 1 March - to secure  agreement on the future shape of Welsh devolution.\n\nArticle: Wilbur Ross was accused of misleading senators after leaked documents showed his interests in a firm in which some shareholders have ties to the Kremlin.\n\nHe told the BBC that the US had not sanctioned the company, Sibur, so\"there's nothing wrong with that\".\n\nMr Ross also denied he had failed to disclose the information.\n\nEarlier, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal called the revelations of the Kremlin links\"inexcusable\".\n\nThey come as part of a huge leak of financial documents, dubbed the Paradise Papers, revealing how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens.\n\nWhat did Wilbur Ross do, according to the leaks?\n\nThe leaks show he has investments in shipping firm Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting oil and gas for Sibur. Two major Sibur shareholders have been sanctioned by the US:\n\nAnother key Sibur shareholder is President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, who holds a 3.9% stake in the firm. While he is not subject to sanctions, his father, Nikolai, is.\n\nMr Ross has not disputed the revelations, telling the BBC:\"There's nothing whatsoever improper about Navigator having a relationship with Sibur.\"\n\n\"If our government decided to sanction them, that would be a different story,\"he continued. \n\nHe said he had disclosed the business links to the office of government ethics, and denied misleading the confirmation hearing committee when he took office.\n\nHe said he had never met any of the figures concerned.\n\nThe US imposed some sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election.\n\nThe commerce department earlier said Mr Ross had\"been generally supportive of the administration's sanctions of Russian and other entities\".\n\nWhat's the problem then?\n\nPrior to being confirmed in office as commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross did not reveal to Congress the full details of his company holdings.\n\nAccording to the leaks, he retains a financial interest in Navigator Holdings via a number of companies in the Cayman Islands, some of which he did disclose at the time of his confirmation.\n\nHowever, under the disclosure rules he did not have to declare his interest in Navigator Holdings.\n\nBut questions will be raised about Mr Ross's potential conflicts of interest and whether his ties undermine US sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies,\"Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told NBC News after the revelations came to light.\n\nMr Blumenthal has called for an investigation into the treasury secretary's links to President Putin's son-in-law.\n\nThe leaks come as an investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian connections to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign team continues. \n\nMr Trump's presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations\"fake news\". \n\nHow close is Ross to Trump?\n\nThey have known each other for more than a quarter of a century. Mr Ross played a key part in a pre-packaged bankruptcy deal - an agreement between a company and its creditors - for Mr Trump's Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, in the 1990s.\n\nHe stepped in to represent the angry bondholders but liked Donald Trump's style.\n\nMr Ross, according to Trump biographer David Cay Johnston, was the key negotiator preventing Donald Trump from\"being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name\".\n\n\"If it hadn't been for Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump would not be in the White House.\"\n\nHow close is Ross to Navigator Holdings?\n\nWL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company.\n\nOn the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary, Mr Ross was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings at a New York restaurant, Bloomberg reports.\n\nMr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator:\"Your interest is aligned to mine. The US economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary.\"\n\nAnother key Navigator customer has been PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company. It was targeted by US sanctions this year.\n\nTimeline: Wilbur Ross's links with Sibur\n\nNovember 2012: Navigator sign charter deal with Sibur.

If not a fungus, the organism could be from an extinct branch of life that has not been described before. \n\nProf Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History led the research team.\n\nHe said, in the past, scientists may have been looking in the wrong place for the oldest fossil fungi - on land or in shallow seas rather than in the deep sea.\n\n\"The deep biosphere (where the fossils were found) represents a significant portion of the Earth, but we know very little about its biology and even less about its evolutionary history,\"Prof Bengtson told BBC News.\n\nThe fossils are almost indistinguishable from those found in similar environments on land, although they are much older.\n\nThey are made up of jumbles of tangled threads some hundredths of a millimetre thick.\n\nScientists have already discovered such structures - known as mycelia - in similar rocks of a much younger age and identified them as fungi.\n\nThere is a\"clear possibility\"that they are the world's oldest fossil fungi - twice as old as generally accepted in the fossil record, Prof Bengtson said.\n\nIf they are not fungi, they are probably an extinct branch of eukaryotes\"or even giant prokaryotes\", he added.\n\nEukaryotes are any cell or organism with a clearly defined nucleus, while prokaryotes have no nucleus.\n\nThe fossils were collected by drilling into ancient rock formed from bubbly lava that was once beneath the sea bed in what is now the Northern Cape Province of South Africa.\n\nKnown as the Ongeluk Formation, the location was underwater at the time the organisms would have been alive.\n\nThe fungi may have colonised cavities of rock deep beneath the sea floor.\n\nCo-researcher, Magnus Ivarsson, said it would have been an extreme environment far away from sunlight.\n\n\"Fungi in this environment most probably lived in symbiosis with microbes utilising chemically stored energy for their metabolism,\"he said.\"They may not even have needed free oxygen.\"\n\nThe research is published in Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\nWriting in the journal, Nicola McLoughlin of Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, who is not connected with the study, said the fossil challenges current thinking on when and where eukaryotes evolved.\n\nIt\"raises the question of whether we have been looking in the wrong place for the earliest eukaryotes and fossil fungi in particular\", she said.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Fungus-like life forms have been found in rocks dating back 2.4 billion years.\n\nArticle: Officers in Oregon city, Ohio, praised the caller's quick thinking, which led to the alleged abuser being arrested.\n\nThe unnamed woman told local media her mum was being attacked at the time.\n\nThis tactic for subtly calling the emergency services has been internet lore for years, but this is a rare confirmed case of it being effective.\n\nOfficials have previously warned that the strategy is not guaranteed to work, as dispatchers are not trained to recognise a pizza order as a genuine call for help.\n\nThe dispatcher who answered the call, Tim Teneyck, told local news station 13 ABC he initially thought the woman had dialled an incorrect number.\n\nWhen she insisted she was through to the right person, he realised what was happening - partly because he had seen similar scenarios being shared on social media.\n\n\"You see it on Facebook, but it's not something that anybody has ever been trained for,\"Mr Teneyck said.\"Other dispatchers that I've talked to would not have picked up on this. They've told me they wouldn't have picked up on this.\"\n\nWhat did the caller say?\n\nHere's a transcript of the conversation.\n\nMr Teneyck: Oregon 911\n\nCaller: I would like to order a pizza at [address redacted].\n\nMr Teneyck: You called 911 to order a pizza?\n\nCaller: Uh, yeah. Apartment [redacted].\n\nMr Teneyck: This is the wrong number to call for a pizza...\n\nCaller: No, no, no. You're not understanding.\n\nMr Teneyck: I'm getting you now.\n\nLater in the call, the woman found creative ways to answer Mr Teneyck's yes or no questions about how much danger she and her mother were in, and what services they needed.\n\nMr Teneyck: Is the other guy still there?\n\nCaller: Yep, I need a large pizza.\n\nMr Teneyck: All right. How about medical, do you need medical?\n\nCaller: No. With pepperoni.\n\nWhere does the pizza idea come from?\n\nIt is unclear where exactly the idea originated, but a very similar scenario was used in a campaign by the Norwegian Women's Shelter Association in 2010. \n\nFour years later, in May 2014, a user on discussion website Reddit claiming to be a 911 operator described a domestic abuse victim calling to order a pizza. They wrote that the call\"started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious\"- before describing a conversation similar to the one Mr Tenyck had.\n\nA few months later a number of news sites reported on the Reddit post, and in 2015 it was even turned into a Super Bowl ad addressing domestic abuse.\n\nThe scenario later became a viral\"public service announcement\"on social media, with one Facebook post making the unsubstantiated claim that\"dispatchers are trained\"to recognise the pizza call as a call for help, and to ask specific questions.\n\nThis claim was debunked last year. Christopher Carver, the dispatch centre operations director for the National Emergency Number Association in the US, told the Associated Press that police are not trained to listen out for any specific code words or scenarios.\n\n\"Setting any expectations of secret phrases that will work with any 911 centre is potentially very dangerous,\"he said, and recommended that people use 911's SMS service instead. \n\nBut the\"Text to 911\"service is not available in all US locations, and is not functioning in Oregon city in Ohio.\n\nMr Carver did say that dispatchers would not hang up on a caller. The priority, he added, is for callers to let the dispatcher know their location.\n\nWhat can people in the UK do?\n\nPeople who need to make a discreet call to 999 - the UK's emergency services number - can do so using the British police's\"silent solution\"system.\n\nA 999 caller who is unable to speak can key in the number 55 to silently inform officers that they are experiencing a genuine emergency.\nTL;DR: A woman in a domestic violence situation managed to call 911 without the perpetrator realising, by pretending to order a pizza.\n\nArticle: Mr Rudd chose not to take part in the ballot knowing he would suffer an embarrassing defeat to his deputy. \n\nMs Gillard said she believed\"a good government was losing its way\"and vowed to revive Labor ahead of a general election expected in October.\n\nThe party has suffered a sharp drop in support in opinion polls this year.\n\nA turn-around on a carbon trading scheme and a wrangle over a controversial mining tax led to a sharp slide in approval ratings for Mr Rudd's government. \n\nMs Gillard, who was deputy prime minister before the surprise Wednesday night challenge to Mr Rudd, stood unopposed at a vote of the Labor Party's 112 members of parliament at a meeting on Thursday morning.\n\nTreasurer Wayne Swan was elected the new deputy leader, also unopposed.\n\nMs Gillard was born in Barry in south Wales, moving to Australia with her family at the age of four.\n\nEmotional\n\nEmerging victorious from the party vote at Parliament House in Canberra, Ms Gillard told reporters:\"I came to the view that a good government was losing its way. \n\n\"I believe too I have a responsibility to make sure at the next election that Labor is there at its strongest.\"\n\nOn the issue of a planned\"super tax\"on mining, which had dogged Mr Rudd, she said she wanted a consensus.\n\n\"We need to do more than consult, we need to negotiate... we need to end this uncertainty,\"she said.\n\n\"Today, I am throwing open the government's door to the mining industry and in return I ask the mining industry to open its mind.\"\n\nOn Mr Rudd, she said:\"He was the leader who saw us through the global financial crisis.\n\n\"He came within a breath of brokering an international agreement on climate change.\"\n\nMr Rudd, 52, repeatedly choked back tears as he and his family appeared before the media in Canberra.\n\n\"I have given it my absolute all and in that spirit I am proud of the achievements we have delivered to make this country fairer,\"he said.\n\nMr Rudd said he would devote himself to helping Labor get re-elected, adding that they were\"a good team led by a good prime minister\".\n\n\"I'm proud of the fact that we kept Australia out of the global financial crisis,\"he said. \n\n\"I'm proud of the fact that had we not done so, we would had had half a million Australians out there out of work.\"\n\nOpposition Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott dismissed the change of leadership, saying Ms Gillard was committed to the\"same dud policies\"of her predecessor.\n\n\"They've changed the salesman but they haven't changed the product,\"he told reporters.\n\nFall from grace\n\nMr Rudd had called a late-night news conference on Wednesday to announce the ballot after Ms Gillard said she would challenge him for the party leadership. \n\nMr Rudd, who led Labor to a landslide election victory against the Liberal government in 2007, blamed\"a number of factional leaders\"within the party for plotting against him.\n\nMr Rudd had initially insisted he would stand in the leadership ballot, but the BBC's Nick Bryant in Australia said that by Thursday morning Mr Rudd could not even muster enough support to contend the ballot.\n\nMr Rudd started this year as the most popular Australian prime minister in three decades and was widely expected to win the federal election expected in October with ease.\n\nBut his popularity plummeted following a number of policy setbacks, our correspondent adds. \n\nHe shelved the centrepiece of his environmental strategy, an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which led to accusations of political cowardice. \n\nMr Rudd then entered into an advertising war with the country's powerful mining sector over his plans for a super tax on their\"super profits\".\nTL;DR:",

education register meant authorities did not have a full picture of how children in their area were taught.\n\nThere is no official figure for how many UK children are home schooled, but is estimated to be around 50,000.\n\nProposals for a register for home educators were shelved in April.\n\nHome educators rejected the suggestion that a register for home-schooled children was necessary.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the vast majority of home schooled children were happy with their education, the Ofsted report said it was a challenge for local authorities to meet their statutory duty to ensure all children had a\"suitable education\".\n\nCurrently, parents in England are not required to inform either the local authority or any other public body that they are educating a child at home, unless the child is being removed from a special school.\n\nInspectors warned:\"There was no reliable way to establish how many children were resident but'invisible', having never entered the school system.\"\n\nRegister scrapped\n\nThe previous Labour government came close to bringing in a compulsory register for home educators in England, following recommendations made in a review  of home education by former Kent education chief Graham Badman.\n\nBut former Schools Secretary Ed Balls was forced to drop the plan just before the general election, when he failed to win Conservative support for it and a slimmed-down version of his Children, Schools and Families Bill was pushed through parliament. \n\nFor its report, entitled Local authorities and home education, Ofsted spoke to 120 parents and 130 children from 15 local authority areas between September and December last year.\n\nInspectors found the children they spoke to were enthusiastic about being educated at home.\n\nJust over half the parents surveyed were home educating because they were frustrated by experiences they and their children had had while at school. \n\nBullying was a factor for around a third of parents and over a quarter of the 130 children whose parents spoke to inspectors had a statement of special educational needs.\n\nBut inspectors stressed the difficulty for local authorities in keeping tabs on all children who were not being taught in school.\n\nChief inspector Christine Gilbert said:\"Current legislation around elective home education means it is extremely challenging for local authorities to meet their statutory duty to ensure children have a suitable education.\" \n\nA spokesman for the home educators' group, Education Otherwise, said:\"We note that the contents of this report seem remarkably similar to the now-discredited Badman report, which parliament rejected before the general election. \n\n\"We are confident that the new government's commitments to civil liberties and a smaller state means they will reject these recommendations out of hand.\"\n\nParents' rights\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said:\"We respect the right of parents to home educate their children. \n\n\"The Ofsted report confirms that most parents who educate their children at home do a very good job, some of them picking up the pieces where children have had problems at school. \n\n\"We note Ofsted's findings and recommendations and ministers will shortly be considering if changes need to be made to the existing arrangements, given the strong views expressed by both home educators and local authorities.\"\n\nIn Wales, as in England, there is no requirement for parents to inform local authorities of the fact that they intend to educate at home.\n\nIn Scotland, parents are entitled to home educate, but need consent if this involves removing their child from school.\nTL;DR: It is \"extremely challenging\" for councils to ensure children taught at home in England receive a suitable education, inspectors have warned.\n\nArticle: A spokesman for the archbishop said refugees would be welcome to a four-bedroom cottage at the palace, his official London residence.\n\nLambeth Palace said it was something he had been considering for\"a while\".\n\nHis gesture follows a similar move by the Catholic church after Pope Francis said two refugee families would move into Vatican housing.\n\n'Desperate for sanctuary'\n\nA spokeswoman said the cottage, which is situated in the grounds of Lambeth Palace, is currently being redecorated and could provide room for a\"family or two\".\n\nShe said:\"As a Christian who leads the Church of England it is something he feels absolutely passionate about.\n\n\"As the archbishop has said, Jesus was a refugee, and there are refugees here who are desperate for sanctuary from war-torn places and the archbishop is completely torn about their situation and wants to make a difference.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the first of 20,000 Syrian refugees are expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron said earlier in the month that the UK would be taking in that amount of refugees by the year 2020.\n\nHowever the refugees will be taken from camps bordering Syria, and according to the Church Times the Most Rev Justin Welby argues that this neglects Christian refugees, who avoid the camps for fear of religious persecution.\n\nThe Church Times said the archbishop had met privately with the prime minister to discuss the issue.\n\nSince January 2014 a total of 216 Syrian refugees have been taken into the UK under the government's Vulnerable People Relocation Scheme (VPRS).\n\nBefore that about 5,000 Syrians have been granted asylum in the UK in the last four years.\nTL;DR: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has promised to offer sanctuary for Syrian refugees at Lambeth Palace.\n\nArticle: TBAP Aspire AP Academy, in Harlow, Essex, has been rated inadequate across the board after an inspection in May.\n\nIssues included poorly maintained child protection records and poor pupil behaviour which made the school\"unsafe\".\n\nThe academy's trust said it\"deeply regretted\"the shortcomings and is determined to make improvements. \n\nOfsted inspectors visited the school, which specialises in children who have been excluded from other schools, on 8 and 9 May.\n\nIn their report inspectors said:\"Pupils and staff shared serious concerns with inspectors about the behaviour of pupils that, at times, means that the school is unsafe.\"\n\n\"Not enough attention is paid to protecting the school's most vulnerable pupils. \n\n\"For example, leaders are unclear about how many pupils are actually on the school roll or their whereabouts.\"\n\nOther Harlow stories you may be interested in:\n\nTBAP Multi-Academy Trust said:\"The trust acknowledges the important findings in the latest Aspire Ofsted report. \n\n\"We deeply regret the impact of shortcomings on the school's community and we are determined to make significant improvements.\n\n\"A leadership team from the trust is in place to support and expedite positive change at Aspire.\"\n\nAcademies minister Lord Agnew said:\"TBAP Trust was issued a Financial Notice to Improve last year due to concerns surrounding its financial management, and this will not be lifted until we are certain that action has been taken to address this.\n\n\"The majority of TBAP's schools have been rated as Ofsted'good' or'outstanding' and have improved since converting to an academy.\n\n\"Our priority is always the safeguarding and education of pupils in the UK, and we will continue to monitor and support academies - such as TBAP Aspire Academy - to maintain that.\"\nTL;DR: Safeguarding is ineffective and leaders do not know how many pupils are on the roll at a school, Ofsted has said.\n\nArticle: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter\n\nHe told me that because of the way the agreement treats Northern Ireland and the rest of the country differently - and the way the country couldn't decide on its own to leave the so-called backstop - that the draft deal is a betrayal of people's trust. \n\nMr Raab, who says he told the chief whip straight after cabinet yesterday that he would quit, says the prime minister can still change course, and should be ready to walk away with no deal. \n\nHe insists the short-term disruption that might entail - which many of his colleagues think would be catastrophic - would be worth it. Better in his view to tolerate short-term pain, than lock ourselves into a dreadful arrangement for years and years to come.  \n\nThat prospect horrifies others in the government, and on the backbenches too. But it's a risk worth taking he says - claiming it's the best way to proceed, to be willing to risk no deal in the face of what he describes as the EU's\"blackmail\". \n\nThe alternative for the prime minister, carrying on like this, he says, is inevitable defeat in the Commons and who knows what would happen then. Might he put himself forward if it all falls apart? \n\nHis answer was it is\"irresponsible\"to be talking about that right now. But notably, not ruling himself out and knowing, perhaps in a few days' or weeks' time, he might have to give a very different answer. \n\n10:00 GMT: A resignation in itself is not a surprise - but the departure of the Brexit secretary might be the domino that causes everything else to fall.\n\nIt's not just that it was his job to make the policy work. It's because he has just given unhappy Brexiteers someone to rally round, and someone who sees himself as a potential challenger to the PM.\n\nAfter his departure, it becomes extremely difficult for other Brexiteers unhappy about the deal to stay on.\n\nAnd in the last few minutes Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has decided to leave the government.\n\nThere is speculation about International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt too, although sources close to her say a departure today is far from definite.\n\nMeanwhile, No 10 is busy trying to explain its policy this morning to opposition politicians and then to Parliament in the next hour.\n\nBut there have been three resignations from government - Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to quit - and it's not even 10:00 GMT.\n\nIt's too early to say if this morning's storm will be a hurricane that will sweep the policy, and maybe the prime minister away.\nTL;DR: 12:00 GMT: I've just been speaking to Dominic Raab, the now former Brexit Secretary. His verdict on the prime minister's deal is damning.\n\nArticle: The Carlisle store was originally earmarked for closure when the chain revealed in June that it was closing 31 of 59 stores, affecting 6,000 jobs. \n\nIt was saved from administration by Sports Direct, which said the store would stay open, safeguarding 67 jobs. \n\nThe chain's new owner said its team had\"worked round-the-clock\"to keep stores open.\n\nJames Keany, Head of National Agency at CBRE which took part in the negotiations, said\"This is another deal to add those agreed last week. \n\n\"The team have been working round the clock and over the bank holiday weekend to secure as many deals as possible safeguarding stores and jobs for local communities.\"\n\n'Fundamental change'\n\nIn June House of Fraser announced a rescue plan for its ailing business which failed and it was bought by Sports Direct for \u00a390m. \n\nIn recent days its flagship London Oxford Street store had been saved, as well as branches in Telford and Plymouth. \n\nHouse of Fraser chairman Frank Slevin said previously the retail industry was undergoing\"fundamental change\", and the company\"urgently needs to adapt\".\n\nHouse of Fraser started with a shop in the centre of Glasgow almost 170 years ago. \n\nIt became a retail empire with more than 100 department stores, including iconic luxury store Harrods in 1959.\nTL;DR: The only Cumbrian branch of House of Fraser will not shut, it has been announced.\n\nArticle: Richard Ratcliffe said charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arrested in April, had called him from prison and said:\"I can't bear to be in this place any longer.\"\n\nShe also said she missed her two-year-old daughter Gabriella\"all the time\".\n\nGabriella's passport was taken after her mother's arrest. The child is staying with her grandparents in Iran. \n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran airport after visiting her family on holiday.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office said it was\"deeply concerned\"about the reports of her sentence and ministers would continue to raise the case with Iranian officials. \n\n'Hostile network'\n\nMr Ratcliffe, from north London, said his wife had phoned just before 09:00 BST on Friday to tell him she had been given a five-year sentence.\n\nShe told him:\"It has been horrendous. I do not want to wake up each morning and remember where I am. I want to stay in my dreams.\"\n\nShe added:\"I have been here so long. Do you understand what it is like to be a mother kept away from her child this long?\n\n\"I have missed over a fifth of her life. What does that do to her?\"\n\nThe family say there has never been clear information about what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is accused of, but Iranian officials have previously accused her of leading a\"foreign-linked hostile network\".\n\nMr Ratcliffe said he had asked his wife during the phone call what the charges against her were.\n\nHe said she had asked a guard who was standing next to her by the phone and the guard had said:\"National security charges.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Richard Galpin, BBC world affairs correspondent\n\nFor weeks following Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's arrest, her husband said nothing in public, hoping pressure from the Foreign Office might persuade Iranian authorities to release her quickly.\n\nWhen nothing came of that, he started campaigning publicly for his wife and two-year-old daughter to be allowed to return to Britain.\n\nThe story was reported in the media in many countries, with more than 800,000 people signing a petition calling for her release.\n\nBut now that too seems to have failed, and may even have backfired.\n\nThe judge who convicted her made it clear he was unhappy about the media campaign, and even claimed it was evidence she was guilty.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have reportedly claimed her work in helping to provide training for journalists and human rights activists, was part of a plot to undermine Iran's government.\n\nBut it may be more about splits between the hardliners and moderates within the regime.\n\nAlternatively, some analysts believe hardliners may want Western prisoners available to use as bargaining chips or for prisoner swaps.\n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her lawyer were in court to hear the sentence passed down, but Mr Ratcliffe said it was not clear whether she had been told what she was charged with.\n\nHe told the BBC it was possible that she knew but had been forbidden from telling her family.\n\n\"It remains extraordinary that Nazanin's interrogators clarify the sentence but not the crime - because there is none,\"he said.\n\nThe case was\"shrouded in shadows and internal politics\", he added.\n\n'Bargaining chip'\n\nHe also noted the timing, saying the court's decision - on 6 September - came a day after the UK had appointed an ambassador to Iran for the first time since 2011.\n\n\"Nazanin's detention and charges have always felt like she and Gabriella are being held as a political bargaining chip for internal and international politics,\"Mr Ratcliffe said.\n\n\"The fact that she was sentenced with unrecognisable charges the day after the UK embassy was upgraded makes this all the clearer.\" \n\nMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is expected to serve her sentence in Evin Prison, where she is currently being held in a high-security wing controlled by the Revolutionary Guard.\n\nMaziar Bahari, a journalist and former detainee at Evin Prison told the BBC it was an infamous jail with a history of executions and torture. \n\n\"Thousands of innocent lives perished in that prison and for someone like her who has not had any prison experience, being there will be a real torture,\"he said.\n\nMr Ratcliffe said he had told his wife she was\"much loved\".\n\n\"I have thousands of messages for her to read one day. They keep me going now,\"he said.\n\n\"They will be so important for her journey back once this cruelty is over.\n\n\"I told her we so look forward to having her home.\"\n\nMr Ratcliffe visited Downing Street in May as part of the campaign to free his wife, and last month Theresa May\"raised concerns\"over the case with Iran's president.\n\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said Mrs May and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would continue to raise the case\"with their counterparts in Iran\".\n\nShe said the government would also\"continue to press the Iranians for consular access and for due process to be followed\".\n\nLabour's Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, said it was\"no longer good enough for Downing Street and the Foreign Office to'raise concerns' about this case\".\n\nShe said it was time to\"demand answers\".\n\nMonique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said:\"I want to reiterate my total support to Nazanin and her family in these terrible circumstances and I ask the Iranian authorities to release her as soon as possible.\n\n\"I am convinced of her innocence and reiterate that she had no dealings with Iran whatsoever in her professional capacity at the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"The foundation does not operate in Iran directly or indirectly.\"\n\nThe Iranian embassy has not yet responded to a BBC request for a comment.\nTL;DR: A British-Iranian mother has been jailed for five years in Iran on \"secret charges\", her husband says.\n\nArticle: In a series of tweets, he said Attorney General Jeff Sessions must halt the inquiry into alleged election meddling.\n\nMr Trump also labelled special counsel Robert Mueller, who leads the probe,\"totally conflicted\".\n\nHis remarks are notable because he himself has previously acknowledged the US Department of Justice should be free from political interference.\n\nAccording to US media, some Trump aides believe that Mr Mueller will report soon on the findings of his 14-month investigation as they relate to the president.\n\nIn a fusillade of tweets on Wednesday, the Republican president also lashed out at the case against his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose trial is entering its second day.\n\nMr Manafort's trial is the first arising from Mr Mueller's investigation.\n\nMr Trump also said Mr Manafort was being treated worse than the Prohibition-era Chicago mobster Al Capone.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said at a press briefing that the tweet is\"not an order\".\n\nShe described it as Mr Trump's\"opinion\", adding:\"I think he's been crystal clear about how he feels about the investigation from the beginning.\"\n\nInteresting timing \n\nAnalysis by Jon Sopel, BBC North America Editor\n\nThere is nothing new about the president's frustration, agitation and anger at the special counsel investigation. \n\nBut this is the first time in overt terms that he has called on the attorney general to fire Robert Mueller. The timing is interesting too - his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has just gone on trial, accused of failing to declare the extent of his business connections with pro-Moscow Ukrainian politicians. \n\nIt also comes as the Mueller inquiry starts moving closer to the Trump family circle - in particular, the behaviour of his son, Donald Jr and son-in-law Jared Kushner over a meeting at Trump Tower during the campaign with a Russian lawyer who had close links to the Kremlin. \n\nTechnically the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, can't fire Mueller as he has recused himself from the Russia investigation. \n\nIronically, one of the areas the Mueller investigation is looking at is whether the president has used Twitter to try to pressurise or intimidate his attorney general.\n\nThe president's tweet today might be seen as relevant.\n\nMr Manafort, 69, led Mr Trump's campaign for three months until August 2016.\n\nHe is charged with tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine.\n\nTrump ex-campaign chief'lied', court told\n\nBut Mr Manafort is not accused of aiding Russia's alleged attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election Mr Trump's way, a focus of the Mueller investigation. \n\nThe special counsel is also scrutinising whether there were any attempts by the president to obstruct justice.\n\nThe president wields significant constitutional authority over the Department of Justice since it belongs to the executive branch of US government.\n\nBut it has been a US civic tenet ever since the Nixon-era Watergate scandal that the agency should be free from political interference.\n\nMr Trump has previously acknowledged it is\"the saddest thing\"that he is not supposed to meddle with the law agency.\n\nWhat's the reaction?\n\nUtah's Republican Senator Orrin Hatch told journalists that many\"wish the Mueller investigation would go away,\"but added,\"that's not going to happen\".\n\nThe third highest-ranking Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters on Capitol Hill:\"Most of us up here believe the process needs to play out, and it will.\"\n\nDemocratic congressman Adam Schiff called the president's words\"an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight\". \n\nWhat's the latest in the Manafort trial?\n\nOn Wednesday, District Judge TS Ellis took issue with the term\"oligarch\"- which prosecutors used to describe the Ukrainian politicians for whom Mr Manafort worked - calling the word\"pejorative\".\n\n\"We're not going to have a case tried that he associated with despicable people and, therefore, he's despicable,\"the judge said.\"That's not the American way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors called as their first witness Democratic strategist Tad Devine, who worked for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election.\n\nMr Devine described how in 2010 they both assisted now-deposed Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych during his presidential campaign.\n\nMr Manafort\"worked harder than anybody\"during the campaign, he said.\n\nThe court also heard on Wednesday from an FBI agent who led the raid on Mr Manafort's Virginia home, an incident that has been heavily criticised by Mr Trump.\n\nMatthew Mikuska testified that he knocked three times on the door before using a key to open it.\nTL;DR: US President Donald Trump has ramped up his attacks on the Russia investigation by demanding it end \"right now\".\n\nArticle: Mr Puigdemont, who is wanted in Spain for sedition and rebellion, was held crossing from Denmark on the way to Belgium, his lawyer said.\n\nMr Puigdemont will appear before a German judge on Monday. \n\nThe ex-leader's supporters gathered in Barcelona to protest against his arrest. The charges he faces in Spain could result in 30 years in prison.\n\nMr Puigdemont has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since Catalonia's parliament unilaterally declared independence from Spain in October.\n\nHe was visiting Finland last week when the arrest warrant against him was reissued, and he slipped out of the country on Friday before Finnish authorities could arrest him.\n\nHe is spending the night in a prison in the north German town of Neumuenster.\n\nHis court appearance on Monday will be a formality to confirm his identity. Afterwards a decision will be made about whether he will remain in custody while the extradition order is being processed.\n\nGerman police said that Mr Puigdemont was detained by a highway patrol in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, which borders Denmark.\n\nAfter the news of his arrest broke on Sunday, thousands of demonstrators poured on to the streets of Barcelona.\n\nThey chanted\"Freedom for the political prisoners\"and\"This Europe is shameful!\"as they headed to the offices of the European Commission and the German consulate. \n\nA smaller protest was held in Girona, where Mr Puigdemont once served as mayor. \n\nTensions in Catalonia are very high and its separatist leaders abandoned plans to name a new president following the arrest of the latest candidate, Jordi Turull, on Friday.\n\nProtesters clashed with police in Barcelona on Friday night after Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Mr Turull was among five people taken into custody in fresh arrests. \n\nThe rulings were considered the most serious challenge to date to the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight.\n\nFollowing the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority.\n\nInternational warrants for Mr Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders were withdrawn in December by a Spanish judge, who said they had shown a willingness to return to the country.\n\nThe warrants were reissued on Friday, surprising Mr Puigdemont, who had been in Finland to give a university lecture.\n\nAmong those also wanted is Catalonia's former education minister, Clara Ponsati. She is in Scotland, where she has a position at the University of St Andrews, and says she is willing to hand herself in. \n\nWho is Carles Puigdemont? \n\nCarles Puigdemont, 55, is a former journalist who worked for pro-independence media in Catalonia and headed the Catalan News Agency. \n\nAfter moving to politics, he became an MP and later mayor of Girona, north-east of Barcelona. \n\nIn 2016, he became leader of Catalonia and led the region to the referendum the following year. \n\nDuring his self-imposed exile following the resulting crisis, Mr Puigdemont told Belgian TV he was not hiding from\"real justice\"but from the\"clearly politicised\"Spanish legal system.\n\nHow we got here\n\n1 October 2017: The independence referendum takes place in Catalonia; it is deemed illegal by Spain and boycotted by many potential voters \n\n27 October: Catalonia's leaders declare independence, which leads to the Spanish government imposing direct rule on the region and dissolving its parliament \n\n30 October: Charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds are brought against various sacked members of the Catalan government, including Mr Puigdemont\n\n2 November: Several former Catalan ministers are taken into custody in Spain  \n\n3 November: European Arrest Warrants are issued against Mr Puigdemont and four of his allies, who have all fled to Belgium \n\n5 December: A Spanish judge withdraws the European arrest warrants but says the group still face possible charges for sedition and rebellion\n\n21 December: Carles Puigdemont is re-elected to parliament during Catalan's regional elections - which Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy had called to\"restore democracy\"\n\n1 March 2018: Mr Puigdemont says he is stepping aside and he backs detained activist Jordi Sanchez to run as Catalonia's president \n\n21 March: Mr Sanchez drops his leadership bid and instead the candidacy is passed to Jordi Turull, who the following day is rejected by hardline separatists\n\n23 March: Mr Turull and various others are arrested in Spain, and the European arrest warrants are reissued\nTL;DR: Catalonia's ex-leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained by German police acting on a European arrest warrant.\n\nArticle: By Philip SimBBC Scotland News\n\nEducation, health, housing and immigration\n\nHolyrood was set up with a broad set of powers, with areas from education to health being controlled in Edinburgh instead of London.\n\nThese powers have grown, in particular since the 2014 independence referendum which led to the Smith Commission and the Scotland Act 2016.\n\nIn turn, this has led to some confusion about what issues matter during elections - both to the Scottish Parliament and to Westminster.\n\nHolyrood\n\nThe Scottish Parliament was established in 1999, with core powers over:\n\nWestminster\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government retained powers over areas including:\n\nIncome tax, VAT and National Insurance\n\nWhen it was set up in 1999, Holyrood was given the power to vary income tax by 3p in the pound - but it it has never been used.\n\nNevertheless, the parliament's fiscal powers have expanded significantly since then.\n\nIt took on landfill tax and Stamp Duty from April 2015, replacing the latter with the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT).\n\nHolyrood also took on the power to set a Scottish Rate of Income Tax from April 2016. This gives MSPs control over 10p in the pound from the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax - although to date, they have chosen to stick with the rate charged in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe Scotland Act 2016 added significant new powers over tax. Under the existing setup, MSPs had the power to raise funds representing less than 10% of the money Holyrood spends each year. Once all the new provisions are in force that will rise to 36% - and if assigned revenue from VAT is added in 2019/20, it will be 48%.\n\nThis includes, from April 2017, the power to set rates and bands of income tax on non-savings and non-dividend income. In his first budget as finance secretary, Derek Mackay chose not to vary rates - but did set a different threshold for the higher 40p rate.\n\nA borrowing limit first introduced in 2012 rose to \u00a33bn for capital projects and \u00a3600m per year for resource spending, up to an overall limit of \u00a31.75bn.\n\nWhat the Scottish government won't be able to do is alter the rates of National Insurance and VAT, two of the big sources of public revenue.\n\nWestminster has also retained the power to set the personal allowance for income tax, the point at which people start paying tax, as well as corporation tax - although there are plans to devolve the latter to Northern Ireland.\n\nCarer's allowance, winter fuel payments and child benefit\n\nProbably the most significant set of new powers devolved to Holyrood, outside tax, are on welfare and social security.\n\nWork is currently under way to set up a Scottish Social Security Agency, which will oversee the delivery of benefits including;\n\nThe handover of powers is being phased across the current parliamentary term.\n\nWestminster will retain power over the majority of benefits, including the umbrella Universal Credit system - although Holyrood has some administrative control, which the government plans to use to increase the frequency of Universal Credit powers. \n\nThese powers are worth \u00a315bn a year, to the \u00a32.6bn spend on devolved benefits (on 2013/14 figures). \n\nPayments staying at Westminster include;\n\nBut Holyrood has the power to create new benefits, giving MSPs the ability to make different decisions to those taken at Westminster by\"topping up\"some payments.\n\nRailways, speed limits and air taxes\n\nPower over railways was transferred to Holyrood in 2005, and control over franchising followed in the 2016 Scotland Act. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf has since discussed the possibility of setting up a public sector train operator.\n\nRailway policing has also been devolved, and the government is currently pursuing legislation to absorb the functions of the British Transport Police into Police Scotland.\n\nHolyrood has also taken on legislative control over speed limits, road signs, drink-drive limits - which were lowered in 2014 - and parking.\n\nMinisters are also taking control of Air Passenger Duty, which they aim to replace with an Air Departure Tax - with the aim of cutting the current levy by half, and eventually abolishing it altogether.\n\nWestminster retains most powers over;\n\nFracking, abortion and gambling machines\n\nOnshore oil and gas extraction was devolved under the 2016 Scotland Act, and the Scottish government is consulting on whether to make an existing moratorium on\"fracking\"permanent, or whether it should allow the practice.\n\nHolyrood has also taken on management of the Crown Estate and its assets in Scotland from April 2017, and now has regulatory bodies including the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the Office of Gas and Electricity (Ofgem) and the Northern Lighthouse Board report to it annually.\n\nThe 2016 Act gave MSPs legislative power over areas including;\n\nIt also underlined the permanence of Holyrood, noting that the parliament and the Edinburgh government were\"a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements\"which were\"not to be abolished except on the basis of a decision of the people of Scotland voting in a referendum\".\nTL;DR: The Scottish Parliament's powers have grown significantly since it was set up in 1999. So, what do MSPs have control over, and what remains in the hands of MPs at Westminster?\n\nArticle: Robert PestonEconomics editor\n\nAnd for the Co-op, it looks like an amazingly good deal. It is paying a maximum of \u00a3750m for 632 branches and for capital that Lloyds is bestowing on the business of \u00a31.5bn - which means there will be a loss on the transaction of up to \u00a3750m for Lloyds.\n\nWhat the Co-op will be getting is a very solid bank: \u00a324bn of mortgages, matched to the tune of 98% by highly desirable retail deposits.\n\nLloyds is also underwriting the fundraising by the Co-op (the sale of perpetual subordinated debt, since you asked) to pay for the down payment of \u00a3400m. So, in effect, Lloyds is lending the Co-op the purchase price.\n\nThe Co-op's bank will operate off Lloyds' IT systems, and Lloyds is providing the senior management of the Co-op's enlarged bank.\n\nIt is hard to think of any deal in which the seller has provided quite so much help to the buyer. This transaction would be the equivalent of you selling me your house for half its value, in return for an IOU from me, whose value you would be guaranteeing - and you would be throwing in all the furniture and all your possessions (and much of your family) for nothing.\n\nBut Lloyds had no choice. It was forced by European regulators to make the divestment. And it felt there was no better deal on offer (and as a semi-nationalised bank, Lloyds' management took some comfort from the chancellor's enthusiasm for bigging up the Co-op)\n\nThere is one other thing that the Co-op is getting, and that is the TSB brand. For a few years, the branches being sold by Lloyds will be rebranded as TSB, which is one of the few banking names untainted by the financial and ethical disasters of recent times.\n\nThe idea of the rebranding is to deter 4.8 million Lloyds customers, who are being asked to transfer to the Co-op, not to leave in droves: an attempt will be made to reassure all of them that they would be leaving Lloyds for a bank, that if anything, is at least as strong as Lloyds (which may not be that hard, given all the financial, managerial and IT help that Lloyds is handing over).\nTL;DR: With 1,000 branches, 10% of all branches of UK banks, and 7% of the current account market, the enlarged Co-op should represent serious new competition to the giants of British banking.\n\nArticle: Curtis Allen, 49, Gavin Wright, 49, and Patrick Eugene Stein, 47, had gathered firearms and explosives for the attack, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nThe members of a militia group called the Crusaders also kept watch on the target in Garden City, officials said.\n\nThey allegedly planned to strike on 9 November, a day after the US elections.\n\nThe suspects had prepared a manifesto and conspired to detonate a bomb at apartments where Somalis were among some 120 residents, said prosecutors.\n\nThey allegedly discussed parking four explosives-packed vehicles at the corners of the complex to create a large blast in the meatpacking town.\n\nMr Stein offered to provide ammonium nitrate for the devices and contribute up to $300 (\u00a3246) for other materials, according to prosecutors.\n\nIf convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nActing US Attorney Tom Beall said the eight-month investigation had taken FBI agents\"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence\".  \n\nA confidential source attended meetings of the militia group to collect information, according to documents.\n\nIn one of those gatherings, papers said, there was a proposal to carry out an attack similar to the Orlando nightclub shooting.\n\nMr Beall said they ultimately decided to attack the building because of the number of Somalis who lived there.\n\nFriday's charges prompted the Council on American-Islamic Relations to urge law enforcement to boost protection for US mosques. \n\n\"We ask our nation's political leaders, and particularly political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our nation,\"Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, said in a statement.\nTL;DR:",

And it's time for the overwhelming majority of Americans of goodwill, of every race and faith and political party, to say as much - clearly and unequivocally.\"\n\nDuring his presidential campaign Mr Trump said Mexican immigrants included drug dealers, criminals and rapists.\n\nMore recently, he caused widespread anger by suggesting that four US congresswomen of colour\"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came\". He denied his comments were racist.\n\nWhat did President Trump say?\n\nIn a statement from the White House on Monday, Mr Trump called for mental health gun control reforms; the death penalty for those who commit mass murder and more bi-partisan co-operation over gun laws.\n\n\"Mental illness and hate pull the trigger, not the gun,\"Mr Trump said.\n\nHe did not express support for gun control measures proposed in Congress.\n\n\"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\"Mr Trump said.\"These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.\"\n\nThe president also outlined a number of policies, including more co-operation between government agencies and social media companies, changes to mental health laws as well as ending the\"glorification of violence\"in American culture.\n\nHe called for red flag laws that would allow law enforcement authorities to take away weapons from individuals believed to be a threat to themselves or others.\n\nMr Trump said government agencies must work together and identify individuals who may commit violent acts, prevent their access to firearms and also suggested involuntary confinement as a way to stop potential attackers.\n\nHe also said he directed the justice department to propose legislation to ensure those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty.\n\nThe president criticised the internet and\"gruesome\"video games for promoting violence in society.\n\n\"It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence,\"he said.\"We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately.\"\n\nBut he did not address the criticisms of his own harsh rhetoric against illegal immigration, which opponents say has contributed to a rise in racially-motivated attacks.\n\nMr Trump drew criticism after he incorrectly referred to the Ohio city of Dayton - where nine people were killed in one of two mass shootings that occurred just 13 hours apart - as Toledo.\n\n\"May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo, may God protect them.

Throughout our constitutional arrangements, is there a sense that... there has been a move into areas which are properly for those who are elected to decide?\"\n\n\"There is a real risk that those of us in Westminster or in the legal profession do not understand that out in the country there is a concern about whether or not decisions that ought to be taken by democratically accountable politicians are in fact being taken by those who are not elected.\"\n\nBut he said any changes to the UK's constitution required\"careful, calibrated examination\"and suggested these would not be affected by\"colourful comments\"from some inside the government about the need for rapid action. \n\n\"There is going to be no headlong rush to curtail either the independence of the judiciary or the legitimate function of the judiciary in making certain the rule of law is upheld by the government.\"\n\nMr Cox suggested Supreme Court judges could, in future, be subjected to questioning by MPs and peers before they are appointed.\n\nHe said so-called confirmation hearings would\"lend transparency\"to the process for selecting people who wield\"enormous powers\".

At issue is the lawfulness of aspects of the work of GCHQ. \n\nGCHQ has always maintained its work is lawful but critics have raised questions about how the legal framework applies to specific areas such as intelligence sharing with the US and the division between domestic and international communications. \n\nThe tribunal -

The British government has already put in \u00a360m. BAE Systems initially injected \u00a320m in 2015 and has invested new funds in this latest financial round. \n\n\"Rolls-Royce and Boeing - these are really big names, and it's fantastic to be in this position,\"said REL CEO Mark Thomas. \n\n\"Rolls are super-positive about the technology. They want us to be independent and innovative, and to push our technology as hard as possible. And Boeing - that's amazing. They are the world's biggest aerospace company, have decades of expertise and future plans that, for us I'm sure, will be really exciting,\"he told BBC News. \n\nREL is developing what it calls the Sabre engine. This power plant is designed to push a vehicle from a standing start all the way to orbit in a single step. \n\nIt would work like a conventional jet engine up to about Mach 5.5 (5.5 times the speed of sound) before then transitioning to a rocket mode for the rest of the ascent. \n\nKey technologies include a compact pre-cooler heat-exchanger that can take an incoming airstream of over 1,000C and cool it to -150C in less than 1/100th of a second. This would permit Sabre to use oxygen direct from the atmosphere for combustion instead of carrying it in a tank with the weight penalty that implies. \n\nAlthough Sabre is usually talked about in the context of an orbiting spaceplane, it could also be fitted to a vehicle that flies at very high speed from point to point on the Earth's surface. \n\nThis is an application that clearly interests Boeing, whose investment arm, HorizonX Ventures, is driving the tie-up in what is its first investment in a UK-based company. \n\n\"As Reaction Engines unlocks advanced propulsion that could change the future of air and space travel, we expect to leverage their revolutionary technology to support Boeing's pursuit of hypersonic flight,\"said HorizonX vice president, Steve Nordlund. \n\nThose who have followed the REL story over the years will be aware that Rolls-Royce is not really a newcomer to the project. The aero-engine giant was involved in Sabre's precursor years - a spaceplane concept back in the 1980s known as Hotol. \n\nWhen that hit technical difficulties, Rolls-Royce let its interest go, as did British Aerospace. Both are now back, the latter in its current guise as BAE Systems. \n\n\"We are delighted to become a strategic investor in Reaction Engines Limited, an innovative UK company that is helping push the boundaries of aviation technology,\"Rolls' CTO Paul Stein said in a statement. \n\n\"We look forward to working with REL and assisting with the development of their technology, and we plan to incorporate this technology into our own future products.\"\n\nREL is approaching important demonstration milestones. \n\nIn Colorado this summer, it will begin further testing of the pre-cooler technology, confronting it with conditions that simulate the very hot airstreams encountered when vehicles move at hypersonic speeds. \n\nThis will be done under contract with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). \n\nAlso this summer, REL should take control of its new test facility in the UK at Westcott in Buckinghamshire. It is here that the company will mount a demonstration in 2020 of the full Sabre cycle. \n\nAssuming this goes well, REL would then look to put the technology on some kind of flight vehicle. \n\nThe company is expanding fast with more than 160 staff at its Culham HQ. The new investments will allow it to continue the recruitment.\n\n\"The team here is outstanding. We have some of the most talented engineers I've ever worked with, a high percentage of whom are women engineers; and we have a great apprenticeship programme. It feels like we're a good-news story and I want to keep it that way,\"said Mark Thomas.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nTL;DR: Reaction Engines Limited (REL), the UK company developing a revolutionary aerospace engine, has announced investments from both Boeing and Rolls-Royce.\n\nArticle: Russia's response will be\"quite harsh\", Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said.\n\nMoldova's pro-EU government announced the expulsions on Monday, without giving a reason.

He was elected president in November, after pledging to restore close ties with Russia.\n\nThe Russian ambassador was told that the five diplomats - not yet named - must leave Moldova within 72 hours.\n\nMr Karasin called the move\"a deliberate blow against the intensification of Chisinau-Moscow relations, including against President Dodon's positions\".\n\nSpying investigation\n\nIn March a former Moldovan MP, Yuri Bolbochan, was arrested and accused of treason for allegedly having passed secrets to an aide to the Russian military attache. \n\nThe aide - named by Russian media as Alexander Grudin - is reported to be among the five diplomats ordered to leave Moldova.\n\nMoldova signed a far-reaching association agreement with the EU in 2014, and Russia promptly imposed import restrictions on the country's agricultural produce.\n\nRussian troops are stationed in the breakaway Trans-Dniester region, which is economically dependent on Russia and defies the Moldovan government in Chisinau.\n\nIn 2015 Moldova was rocked by a huge fraud case, when more than \u20ac1bn (\u00a3867m; $1.1bn) disappeared from three banks.\n\nThe conflict in neighbouring Ukraine has raised tensions in Moldova, an ex-Soviet republic that Russia sees as part of its sphere of influence.\nTL;DR: Russia has condemned Moldova's decision to expel five of its diplomats, calling it a move against the country's pro-Russian president.\n\nArticle: Maurice, who roosts on the picturesque isle of Ol\u00e9ron off the Atlantic coast, was accused of disturbing a retired couple who own a holiday home nearby.\n\nNews of his legal troubles flew around the world, gaining him a flock of supporters. \n\nHis owner, Corinne Fesseau, was cock-a-hoop at news of the ruling.\n\n\"It's a victory for everyone in the same situation as me.

The men - who identified themselves as loan recovery agents - would call her regularly and shout at her. And the threats often turned abusive.  \n\nMs Teresa found herself in a severe financial crunch in the weeks after India went into lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus. When banks turned her away, she was led to apps that offered\"instant loans\". \n\nAll she had to do was provide her bank account details, government ID and references. The loan was credited to her account in minutes.\"It's that simple,\"she says. \n\nThe apps proliferated as the pandemic and the lockdown left millions in India jobless. While many working class jobs have returned, salaried professionals - from engineers and software developers to salesmen - and small businesses have struggled to survive. So the apps helped them out when they needed money quickly. \n\nFor loans as small as $150 and for periods as short as 15 days, these apps charge a one-time processing fee, a convenience fee and steep interest rates - some as high as 30%. Compare this to to Indian banks, which lend at 10-20% with a tenure of at least 12 months. \n\nThe other problem is that while some of these apps work within India's banking norms, many others don't appear to be legitimate. \n\nSeveral states are now probing dozens of such lending apps after they were accused of violating rules and using aggressive methods to recover loans. India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), which investigates financial crimes, has also stepped in to establish a money trail. Google recently removed several such apps from its Playstore after receiving complaints that they had violated terms. \n\nOfficials have found that many of them are not even registered with India's central bank, which has warned people about\"the growing number of unauthorised digital lending platforms/mobile apps\". It has also advised those in need of money to approach legitimate financial institutions. \n\nExperts say once a borrower secures a loan, their data gets shared with similar apps, which then start pumping them with notifications of higher credit limits, luring them deeper into a web of unregulated borrowing. Ms Teresa says she ended up with eight loans. \n\nAnd the calls from recovery agents can get so harrowing that some people borrowed money again just to pay off the first loan.\"It's like a vicious circle from one loan to another,\"said one borrower who wished to remain anonymous. \n\nLike many other apps, at the time of download, these apps too ask for permission to access contacts and photo galleries. When an unsuspecting borrower agrees to this, they become more vulnerable. \n\n\"When I investigated one such case, I found that these apps are actually not only able to read and access your contact list, they're also capturing your images, videos and location. They also know many things about you - like, where you have actually used this money, to whom you have transferred this money,\"says cyber security expert Amit Dubey.\n\nThe threats too become personal.\"I saw the toll it took on my children,\"Ms Teresa says.\"I have seen the pain my children were going through when they saw me continuously on calls, breaking down and not able to focus on work or on my family.\"\n\nJenis Makwana says it was this kind of harassment that played a role when his brother Abhishek killed himself in November. \n\nAbhishek, a screenwriter for Indian television, saw business dry up during the lockdown due to restrictions on filming and payment delays. So he borrowed about $1,500 - it wasn't long before the threatening calls began, Jenis recalls. He says they have continued after his death. \n\nBoth Makwana's and Ms Teresa's cases are now being investigated by police along with hundreds of similar complaints. \n\n\"We have to keep on digging, this problem is just so deep,\"says Pravin Kalaiselvan, who has been tracking these cases with a small team of experts that shares whatever they find with police. \n\nMr Kalaiselvan got drawn into it when a close friend borrowed money from one of these apps and was harassed when he couldn't repay the loan on time. So he decided to investigate further and started a support group for people who have had similar experiences with such apps. \n\n\"In the last eight months my team has received more than 46,000 complaints and 49,000 distress calls. We receive more than 100 to 200 distress calls a day,\"he says.   \n\nMr Kalaiselvan petitioned India's Supreme Court, seeking a ban on hundreds of these apps. But the court asked him to approach the federal government. \n\nIn December, 17 people were arrested on charges of cheating, fraud and harassment after investigations led police to call centres in Gurgaon, a suburb of capital Delhi, and the southern city of Hyderabad. \n\nPolice say they are trying to trace people further up the chain, possibly even abroad, but experts say it's hard to establish links between those arrested and developers. Also, the borrowers are scattered across the country and no single app connects them all. \n\nBut Mr Dubey says the apps have a more sinister agenda than just targeting the financially vulnerable.\"The invisible entities running such apps are interested in your personal data and there is a lot of money to be made out of this. This data can be stored and sold to criminal syndicates and also floated in the dark web.\"\n\nOn one occasion, he says he found a cluster of apps hosted on the same server, programmed by the same developer - proof that many of them share a source. \n\n\"What's more is that they are hosted on a server which is usually in China, away from Indian jurisdiction and control,\"he adds. \n\nExperts say these apps are difficult to regulate because they operate as intermediaries, connecting borrowers to lenders. So without specific laws that target them, creating awareness may be the only way to stop them. \n\nAnd that is exactly what Ms Teresa hopes to do. \n\n\"I do not want to be called a victim,\"she says.\"The only way to fight back is by talking about my story so that others can learn from my experience.\"\n\nRead more of our coverage on business and the economy\nTL;DR: \"If you don't pay the amount by today, I am calling your friends and relatives.

Here's what she said:\n\nOn her'nightmare'...\n\n[I'm] so relieved and so pleased that justice has been done.\n\nWhen I think of him he makes me shudder and he makes me feel ill.\n\nSomebody who reinvented his persona and has been able to shield himself behind a cloak of respectability and fooled everybody.\n\nHe was an opportunist. He saw a vulnerable person and took advantage of somebody who was a child.\n\nAnd it was awful, it was a nightmare and it had huge implications for me as a young person.\n\nAnd to see him then go on to become very high profile, to speak openly about other paedophiles and damn them and create a persona of a respectable, high-profile man who was lauded by the media was sickening, to say the least.\n\nOn grooming...\n\n[There was a] huge amount of grooming - and of my parents and my sister, which is the hardest part for me because my parents are both dead now.\n\nOn a letter she wrote to Clifford years later...\n\nI awarded him A-plus in grooming children.\n\nI felt, obviously, very strongly when I wrote the letter and it said everything that I wanted to say to him.\n\nAnd it was very difficult to learn that he'd kept that letter and it had obviously given him some kind of pleasure and that's why he held on to it. \n\nThat's still very difficult for me to live with, frankly.\n\nOn the police and the Crown Prosecution Service...\n\nI can only applaud them [the police] for their endeavours, for their integrity, their time, the many hours I gave statements and I was interviewed, their thoroughness.\n\nAnd the CPS for taking it forward to go to court. I think it's been very brave.\n\nI know it's very difficult to prosecute historical allegations of sexual abuse and child sexual abuse so I'm sure it wasn't easy for them.\n\nBut I'm just so glad that they made the decision that they did.\n\nOn the jury...\n\nI'd also like to thank the jury for being able to see through what must have been very difficult for them, given that he did so much to defend himself once he was arrested. \n\nAnd [he] spoke to millions of people, denied the allegations, called us liars, called us fantasists, spoke of his family trauma, his nightmare and I was sceptical that a jury would forget that. \n\nThey have proved me wrong, thank goodness, and I want to thank them for their hours of deliberation and their integrity and  intelligence for seeing through the charade.\n\nOn Clifford...\n\n[He was] hugely powerful. I used to think'who could be worse, who could be a more powerful figure'?\n\nAnd I drew a blank on that, someone with such media coverage... who had the ability to defend himself so publicly.\n\nAnd I worried that, once he was arrested, he would know who I was.\n\nHe knew who I was - he would be able to find me. And I feared for my safety and that of my family.\n\nI feel thankful that we are where we are and he will be sentenced and that everybody will know the kind of man that he is.\n\nAnd, hopefully, if there are more victims out there, and I'm sure that there will be, they have the courage to come forward.\n\nAny people who've suffered as I have, have the power to come forward and report what has happened to them to the police.\nTL;DR: One of Max Clifford's victims has told BBC News of her relief that \"everybody will know the kind of man that he is\".\n\nArticle: Mr Khodorkovsky is awaiting the verdict of his recent trial for theft and money-laundering. \n\nHe is seven years into an eight-year jail term for fraud and tax evasion.\n\nIn a televised question-and-answer session, Mr Putin referred to Mr Khodorkovsky when he said he believed\"a thief belongs in prison\".\n\nHis lawyers said Mr Putin's comments\"removed all doubt about who puts pressure on the court\".\n\nThey said the comments would assist in an appeal against the verdict, should Mr Khodorkovsky be found guilty.\n\nMr Putin was answering questions on a broad range of subjects from ethnic tensions to the state of public housing and police corruption when questioned about Mr Khodorkovsky. \n\nHe said:\"We must operate based on the fact that Mr Khodorkovsky's guilt has been proven in court.\"\n\nComparing Mr Khodorkovsky's treatment to that of the American multi-billion dollar fraudster Bernard Madoff, Mr Putin suggested Russian courts had been\"liberal\".\n\n'Grateful'\n\nOn 27 December, Mr Khodorkovsky will receive the verdict of his second trial, in which he was accused of stealing hundreds of millions of tonnes of oil from his Yukos oil company and laundering the proceeds.\n\nIf found guilty he could be forced to remain in prison until 2017.\n\nIn a statement posted on Mr Khodorkovsky's campaign website, the tycoon's lawyers accused Mr Putin of\"direct interference in the trial and direct pressure on the court\". \n\n\"I am very grateful to Vladimir Putin for what he has done today as he has helped us,\"Mr Khodorkovsky's lead lawyer Vadim Klyuvgant said in the statement.\n\n\"Right at the time when the judge is working on the verdict... he [Mr Putin] removed all doubt about who puts pressure on the court and how this is done.\"\n\nAnother of Mr Khodorkovsky's lawyers, Yuri Schmidt, said such interference was outlawed under Article 17 of the European Convention on Human Rights and as such would allow the defence to make a reference to Mr Putin in any legal appeal against an eventual conviction.\n\n\"If Mr Khodorkovsky is convicted then in the legal complaint that we will make to the European Court of Human Rights we will write that Putin declared the guilt was proven just as the court was writing its judgement.\"\nTL;DR: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been accused of interfering in a legal case after public comments about oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nArticle: Two Romanian men with burns on their hands and arms were rescued after two sites were raided in Barnsley on Thursday.\n\nTheir ID cards and mobile phones had been withheld, the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) said.\n\nA 24-year-old Romanian man was questioned and has been released pending further inquiries.\n\nThe victims suffered injuries to their hands and arms\"through not having the appropriate protective equipment when cleaning vehicles,\"GLAA said.\n\nGLAA said they seized mobile phones and CCTV footage from the sites and several workers were interviewed about their working and living conditions.\n\nThe searches were carried out by GLAA with officers from South Yorkshire Police, HMRC and Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council.\nTL;DR: A man has been arrested on suspicion of modern day slavery offences following raids at car washes.\n\nArticle: Your browser does not support this Lookup\n\nYour guide to financial jargon\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\nAsset holding: Assets stored in an offshore company, reducing taxes.\n\nAsset protection: Places assets offshore to keep them safe from potential creditors.

the so-called\"operational standard\". \n\nBut according to the figures for November 2013, more than 23,500 were left waiting longer - up from just under 8,000 two years ago. \n\nNew high\n\nBBC Wales analysis on statistics also show 32% of patients in Wales waited longer than eight weeks for an ultrasound scan compared with 0.1% in England whose figures were released on Tuesday. \n\nAnd for CT scans, 7.5% of patients in Wales were waiting more than eight weeks whereas the figure for England is 0.07%.\n\nCathy O'Sullivan, acting director of the board of Community Health Councils in Wales which represents patients, told BBC Radio Wales:\"The system is not working in the best interest of patients.\n\n\"It needs a very fundamental shake around how patients are treated in the 21st Century.\"\n\nShadow Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar AM called for the Welsh government to invest more in NHS frontline services.\n\n\"It looks as though the National Health Service is turning into something of a national waiting service,\"he said.\n\nOn Thursday, statistics on referral to treatment times showed that the number of patients waiting longer than nine months for hospital treatment in Wales had hit a new high. \n\nNumbers rose to 13,269 people at the end of November - an increase of about 1,000 on the previous month and nearly 8,000 since March 2013.\n\nThe Welsh government's target is to treat all patients within nine months.\n\nOfficial figures also highlighted 88% of people waited less than 26 weeks to start treatment. The target is 95%.\n\nHealth Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh NHS was\"under pressure\"but stressed it was not\"in crisis\".\n\nHe told BBC Wales:\"There are fewer people waiting overall in the Welsh NHS than before.\n\n\"The number of people waiting over 26 weeks has come down but I am disappointed to see the rise in people waiting over 36 weeks.\n\n\"I've made it clear to local health boards, even in the difficult period over the winter, I expect them to concentrate on those longer waiters and I do expect to see those figures coming down.\"\n\nThursday's figures drew criticism from opposition parties in Wales with the Conservatives describing the situation as an\"increasingly worsening crisis\".\n\nThe Liberal Democrats called the figures\"disgraceful\"and Plaid Cymru said they were a\"predictable result of health boards not scheduling surgery over the winter months\". \n\nIn a response to the McGivern family, a Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spokesperson said:\"We aim to see all patients referred for this type of scan within eight weeks of referral and we are very sorry that Amy had to wait so long to be seen.\n\n\"Due to increasing demands on the service - with referrals for the Wrexham service increasing by 13% this year - for some patients, waiting times have increased.  \n\n\"To tackle this, we have invested in additional MRI capacity in the Wrexham area and have scanned an additional 380 patients during December.  In addition to this, we plan to scan a further 420 patients before the end of March, with the aim of reducing the typical waiting time to the target of eight weeks.\"\n\nA Welsh government spokesperson said:\"Work is already under way to tackle the rise in the number of patients waiting longer than eight weeks, with health boards putting in place a number of measures such as the use of mobile MRI scanners. \n\n\"We would expect to see improvements in the length of wait between now and the summer. This will be linked to the three-year plans that are due in the end of this month, and also to the planned care work programme.\n\n\"The increase in waiting times for diagnostic services has been caused by a rise in demand for services such as scans and endoscopies to help diagnose cancer. \n\n\"Further action to speed up access to diagnostic services will form part of the programme of work announced by the health minister before Christmas to develop sustainable improvement in planned care performance.\"\nTL;DR: The number of patients waiting longer than they should for diagnostic services like MRI scans and ultrasounds has trebled in the last two years.\n\nArticle: West Cumbria Mining sought new approval from Cumbria County Council after amending its plan for the \u00a3165m mine in Whitehaven.\n\nThe firm plans to extract coking coal from beneath the Irish Sea to be used in steel production.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said the council's approval was\"reckless beyond belief\".\n\nThe county council has approved the mine plan twice since 2017, but needed to consider it again after the mining firm said further analysis of the coal meant it could\"improve\"the plant's design.\n\nThe mine would create 500 jobs and pay into a community fund for 10 years.\n\nIt was supported by a number of local politicians with Mike Starkie, the mayor of Copeland, saying:\"This has gone through probably the most rigorous process in Cumbria County Council's history.\n\n\"These type of investment opportunities into the local community come around not even once in a lifetime.\"\n\nMore than 2,300 people objected to the plan along with campaigners including Friends of the Earth, Keep Cumbrian Coal in the Hole (KCCH) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n\nExtinction Rebellion Cumbria protesters staged a\"climate change crime scene\"outside the council's meeting on Friday.\n\nActivist George Smith said there was\"overwhelming scientific evidence\"the coal mine would\"contribute significantly to the climate crisis\", adding:\"[The council's] decision today is reckless beyond belief.\"\n\nThe government will now have to decide whether or not to call the new plan in before it can progress, although it previously declined to intervene.\n\nMeanwhile, a judicial review is due to be heard into the previously approved plan after a challenge from KCCH.\n\nAnalysis: Story does not end with approval\n\nBy Bob Cooper, BBC Radio Cumbria political reporter\n\nFor the third time Cumbria County Council has approved this highly controversial mine, but the story does not end there.\n\nThe council cannot issue an approval notice until the Housing and Local Government Secretary has decided whether to call the decision in.\n\nRobert Jenrick has the power to overrule local planning authorities but has previously rejected a request to do this with respect to the West Cumbria mine.\n\nAny move by the government to scupper the mine would not go down well with local Conservative MPs, including Trudy Harrison, who is Boris Johnson's right-hand woman in the Commons\n\nThese seats were until recently part of Labour's\"red wall\"and it would be hard for ministers to make any decision that would anger the area's MPs.\n\nBut it does present a challenge to the government, which is trying to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and sell its green credentials.\n\nIf the mine finally does get planning permission, campaigners could still try to challenge it in the courts.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

All my mum's favourite songs are there - musicals, Elvis, Tom Jones, Abba.\"\n\nDanny Langhorn from Sunrise said:\"The HUG is not intrusive to them, it's not a person... they're not feeling threatened.\n\n\"They're just able to sit there, listen and in their own time start feeling comfortable.\"\n\nIt was designed by a team led by Cathy Treadaway at the university's Centre for Applied Research in Inclusive Arts and Design, or Cariad.\n\nThe idea came about after a visit to a care home in Port Talbot, during a project to design objects for people with dementia. \n\n\"Thelma's carers asked us to make something for her, and when we asked them what kind of thing they wanted us to make, they told us the only thing they could think that Thelma needed was a hug, so we went away and came up with HUG,\"said Prof Treadaway.\n\nThelma showed improvement within a week: opening her eyes, engaging with other residents of the home, and her falls - which had been frequent - stopped completely.   \n\nThe team then applied for more funding from the Welsh Government to see if Thelma's response could be replicated.\n\nDementia is the umbrella term to describe around 100 conditions including Alzheimer's and is the leading cause of death in Wales and England.\n\nAbout 40,000 people in Wales are living with dementia and there is currently no cure.  \n\nLast week the US drug company Biogen announced it was ready to bring a drug to the market which it said could slow Alzheimer's.\n\nBut approval could take a year or two and if successful the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled on clinical studies of the drug.\n\nIt could be some time before the drug reaches the UK.\n\nBut Alison says she's grateful to see her mum Margaret happy again.\n\n\"The recognition and the smiles and the happiness seem to have come back which is brilliant, brilliant.\"\nTL;DR: \"It's kind of brought her back again.\"\n\nArticle: Poole's Parkstone Grammar School has moved to online learning ahead of half-term, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council said.\n\nAlthough it has not yet disclosed the number of positive cases it said a\"high number of close contacts\"meant a number of students and staff had been asked to self-isolate.\n\nPupils are expected to school return on 2 November.\n\nBCP Council said the school had worked closely with the authority and Public Health Dorset\"to identify all close contacts of the cases and take all necessary measures\". \n\nStudents who have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days have already been taking part in remote learning at home, it added.\nTL;DR: A school in Dorset has temporarily closed due to a rise in Covid-19 cases.\n\nArticle: The four cameras were installed in October on a two-mile stretch and are currently being tested and monitored.\n\nEnforcement action comes into force on 19 January, with currently up to 700 drivers a day ignoring the speed limit. \n\nIt will be the first permanent installation to go into operation on a Welsh section of the motorway.\n\nWales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership GoSafe says the testing period also allows drivers to become familiar with the speed limit.\n\nStatistics given to BBC Wales by the partnership show:\n\nFrom 5 January those people exceeding the limit will receive a cautionary letter informing they have exceeded the speed limit.\n\nEnforcement will start when the system goes live on 19 January.  \n\nJunction trial\n\n\"This will give the general public time to adjust their speeds and change their driving behaviour,\"said a spokeswoman.\n\nThere are also permanent average speed cameras on the A55 in north Wales and the A465 Heads of the Valleys road. \n\nThe GoSafe spokeswoman added:\"Motorists need to be aware that enforcement will begin early in the new year.  \n\n\"GoSafe are looking to run an active media campaign in the run up to the live period in order to inform motorists of the need to comply with the relevant speed limit for the safety of all road users.\"\n\nThe Welsh government is four months into a trial of closing the westbound slip road of junction 41 at Port Talbot during peak hours.\n\nCongestion means traffic speeds drop to between 25-30mph during peak rush hours and the aim is to improve journey times.\n\nThe trial will be reviewed in March 2015 to see whether it has been a success.\nTL;DR: Hundreds of motorists a day are ignoring new average 50mph speed enforcement cameras on the M4 through Port Talbot.\n\nArticle: In his few hours across the border, he called Mexicans\"amazing\"and\"spectacular\"people - in contrast to earlier comments branding Mexican migrants\"rapists\"and\"murderers\".\n\nMexicans had made their views clear to the US Republican presidential candidate before he arrived, saying in no uncertain terms that he was not welcome. \n\nBut the real target of anger over Mr Trump's subdued visit was the man who invited him - President Enrique Pena Nieto, who did not respond as Mr Trump discussed building a wall on their border.\n\nThe criticism could not come at a worse time for the president, whose approval ratings in the middle of last month sat at only 23%.\n\nHow Mexico responded \n\n\"Without a doubt, my perception is that it is going to make it even worse, even stronger the drop in approval\"- Javier Urbano Reyes, a professor of International Studies at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City, to AP\n\n\"What is in his head inviting Donald Trump? We Mexicans have dignity and a memory. Donald Trump is not welcome in Mexico\"- Ricardo Anaya, president of the opposition PAN party\n\n\"\"Today is the worst political moment for Donald Trump, with this absurd meeting in Mexico with President Pena. It's about rescuing someone who is starting to agonise about their poll numbers. It's giving an event, in Mexico, the country that he has insulted. He is the first leader to tend to the hand of xenophobia, to a tyrant. That is inadmissible under any perspective, and secondly, a president is to meet with his peers, not candidates\"- PAN senator Gabriela Cuevas (although it is worth pointing out that Republican candidate John McCain also visited Mexico, and Colombia, during the 2008 presidential race)\n\nMexicans tell Trump:'You're not welcome'\n\n\"I don't understand what's going on here, and I really apologise for our president taking this step forward. I think President Pena is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump\"- former president Vicente Fox to CNN\n\n\"The president allowed him to humiliate him and the Mexican people in our home, in our country, and then he went back to the US and in Arizona he mocked the president and everything he said here... And I could not conceive a worse situation for the president of Mexico now, I really can't\"- Agustin Bastave, MP with opposition PRD party, speaking to the BBC\n\n\"It doesn't strike me as brave to meet someone who has insulted us to such a degree\"- historian Enrique Krauze, on Mexico's biggest morning television show\n\nWhat Enrique Pena Nieto then said\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Trump said he and the president did not discuss the controversial border wall.\n\nBut soon after, Mr Pena Nieto took to Twitter to say:\"At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\"\n\nIn an interview with Televisa after the meeting, the president then said he had arranged the meeting as he was\"convinced that we must confront the problems, threats and risks facing Mexico\", adding that he felt there had been\"a change of tone, a recognition of Mexico's importance\"by Mr Trump, and that the meeting had been a\"rapprochement\".\n\nMexican and US Latino media critical over Trump visit - By BBC Monitoring  \n\nMr Trump's visit to Mexico dominates the front pages in both the Mexican and Latino papers in the US with many criticising President Pena Nieto for having invited him to a formal meeting.\n\nMr Pena Nieto's leadership qualities are called into question in an opinion piece in the Mexican daily, Excelsior, titled\"Trump Veni, Vidi, Vici\".\n\nMr Trump's visit is described as nothing short of a\"capitulation\"on the part of the Mexican leader, who is accused of failing in his duty to\"protect all Mexicans in and out of the country\".\n\nHowever, rival paper El Universal defended the decision saying Mr Pena Nieto's meeting with Donald Trump was a\"necessary step\"in securing Mexico's relationship with its most important economic and political partner. \n\nFor its part, the Los Angeles based La Opinion said it was hard to understand why Mr Trump had been invited to Mexico\"especially after all the insults the latter has spewed against Mexican immigrants and Mexico's leaders\".\nTL;DR: Donald Trump's visit to Mexico on Wednesday came somewhat out of the blue, announced only a day before the trip took place.\n\nArticle: The former first minister said Wales is\"behind most countries in western Europe\"because of the fallout from Carl Sargeant's death.\n\nMr Sargeant was found hanged at his home in Flintshire in November 2017.\n\nHe was sacked as minister for communities and children over claims of inappropriate behaviour towards women.\n\nThe former Alyn and Deeside AM denied the claims but the investigation by the Labour Party was dropped after his death.\n\nMr Jones doubts whether restarting the investigation would help anybody because of the\"emotional cost\"of the\"brutal process\"to Mr Sargeant's family, himself and others.\n\nHe added:\"I think there comes a point where we've got to say,'how much further can this go now?'\"\n\nHe insisted he was not calling for a halt to the official investigation - the Bowen Inquiry - into how he sacked Mr Sargeant.\n\nHowever the Bridgend AM added there was\"absolutely no doubt\"that women are now less likely to come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Lists of women were given to media outlets - the Telegraph and the Sun were two - because they phoned me and read out a list of names and asked me to confirm who the complainants were,\"he said.\n\n\"What was that all about? How did that help anybody?\n\n\"And, in fact, we're in a situation now where it is not safe for women to come forward in Wales.\n\n\"The people who did this have created a situation where we've gone backwards 30 years.\n\n\"In their anger and temper, what they've actually done is made it far easier for men to harass women because women won't come forward anymore. Why would you if you thought you were going to be vilified, abused or named in newspapers or websites?\"\n\nFollowing the inquest into Mr Sargeant's death, coroner John Gittins recorded a conclusion of suicide and said more support should be available to sacked ministers.\n\nHowever Mr Jones responded:\"The coroner said there should be things put in place, but he hasn't said what that should look like.\n\n\"You do ask yourself those questions. But that's what I've wrestled with - what exactly could've been done differently?\n\n\"I know this is a tragedy but it doesn't mean the process itself was wrong.\"\n\nMr Jones said he had\"no idea\"Mr Sargeant had been diagnosed with depression in 2012 despite the coroner's claim he would'probably' have known of the minister's vulnerability.\n\nThe Sargeant's family barrister accused Mr Jones of lying under oath about the nature of the support he had asked Labour's Vale of Clwyd AM Ann Jones to give Mr Sargeant after his sacking. Mr Jones denied the accusation.\n\nThe coroner said Mr Jones had\"properly and appropriately\"corrected information, though only after\"the true picture came to light\"from Ann Jones.\n\nAsked why he made the mistake, the ex-first minister offered:\"At the time, everything was so fast-moving it's very difficult to remember every single detail.\"\n\nMr Jones said he did not think it had been right to reach out to Mr Sargeant's family during the inquest but said he would be\"more than happy\"to meet in the future.\n\nHe added:\"I was never Carl's enemy and I'm not [the family's] enemy. I always got on very, very well with Carl.\"\nTL;DR: Wales has \"gone backwards 30 years\" in terms of women feeling able to come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct, according to Carwyn Jones.\n\nArticle: The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said the market in Scotland during April mirrored the trend seen across the UK.\n\nThere was a drop in new instructions last month and 4% of survey respondents saw a fall in new buyer inquiries.\n\nMeanwhile, tenant demand rose\"moderately\"in the lettings market.\n\nRics said there was anecdotal evidence in Scotland that the lack of choice and uncertainty around the early general election and Brexit were all factors continuing to affect the market.\n\nHowever, there are predictions that all parts of the UK will see a growth in house prices over the next 12 months.\n\nGail Hunter, Rics regional director for Scotland, said:\"Feedback from surveyors suggests ongoing uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming general election and the terms of Brexit.\n\n\"Rics has been clear that both the UK and Scottish governments must bring forward clear, evidence-based positions on how Scotland's relationship with the rest of the UK and the European Union will develop. This would go some way to offsetting the uncertainty being reported.\"\nTL;DR: A lack of available stock is continuing to hamper the Scottish housing market despite a rise in sales prices, according to a survey.\n\nArticle: Councillor leader Gordon Matheson has met with Sir Richard Leese and Sir Robin Wales at a games legacy summit.\n\nSir Richard was leader of Manchester City Council when it hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2002.  \n\nSir Robin, mayor of the London borough of Newham, is involved in preparations for the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nGlasgow has stated that its long-term goal is to ensure that the games benefit the city economically, environmentally, culturally and socially.\n\nBusiness benefits\n\nIt has already established a Commonwealth Games jobs fund, which aims to support the creation of 1,000 jobs by July 2012.\n\nThe council said companies within the city had secured contracts worth \u00a3178m and more than 1,300 apprenticeships had been created for school leavers since 2009.    \n\nThe summit, which took place at the city chambers on Monday, discussed the benefits that the Commonwealth and Olympic Games can bring to host cities. \n\nMr Matheson said:\"The Games legacy summit is a fantastic opportunity for us to find out more about what Manchester did so well in 2002, the legacy that was left and the impact that the preparations for the 2012 Olympic Games are having in London.  \n\n\"Glasgow has already gained a legacy from the Commonwealth Games in 2014, and the legacy plans we have in place will ensure that we make the best of this unique chance for the city. I am sure we will all learn a great deal from each other.\"\n\nDuring the summit, the three civic leaders toured a number of the sites being prepared for the Glasgow 2014 games and meet some key figures involved in preparing and delivering the event.\n\nSir Richard Leese said:\"The Commonwealth Games in Manchester 2002 was a real catalyst for the renewal of the old former industrial area of East Manchester and a key economic driver for the Manchester city-region as a whole.  \n\n\"Nine years later we are still reaping the benefits.\"\n\nSir Robin Wales added:\"I have always said the real benefits of the games come in making people's lives better. \n\n\"They will provide a huge boost to the regeneration of Newham and we will be working hard to maximise the opportunities for local people.\"\nTL;DR: Glasgow has enlisted the help of two political figures in England in its ongoing bid to ensure lasting benefits from the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nArticle: On Monday Chinese papers continued their admonishments, warning Ms Tsai and her DPP party against any move towards independence.\n\nChina sees the island as a breakaway province, which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary.\n\nBefore her win Ms Tsai said she wanted to maintain the\"status quo\".\n\nBut some analysts say her rhetoric has hardened somewhat in the wake of her victory,  when she said that\"any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations\".\n\nHer pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party beat the ruling Kuomintang, which has overseen friendlier and ever-closer ties with China on Saturday. \n\nTwo days later, on Monday, Ms Tsai met former US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, and vowed to maintain close relations with the US in all areas, particularly the economy. \n\nOne report from the  Reuters agency said that DPP Secretary General Joseph Wu would be going to the US.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also congratulated Ms Tsai on her victory, calling Taiwan\"an old friend\".\n\nShe has already set up a taskforce to oversee the transfer of power, Taiwan's third transition of power in its democratic history. \n\nChinese state media lashed out swiftly in the wake of the victory, saying that Taiwan should abandon its\"hallucination\"of independence.\n\nOn Monday, a Global Times report said it wasn't Ms Tsai's pro-independence views that won her the vote but the\"dissatisfactory performance of the incumbent Taiwan leader Ma Ying-jeou and his ruling KMT\".\n\nTsai Ing-wen on China\n\nBefore the election: \n\n\"I will, based on the existing ROC constitutional system, based on democratic principles, on the basis of the largest public opinion, promote cross-strait policy. \n\n\"I will make the greatest efforts to seek a way for Taiwan and mainland China to interact that is mutually acceptable to both sides.

But she would not offer any explanation as to why this may be the case.\n\nShe said:\"The study presents a robust and independent set of findings to inform discussion and debate, and to stimulate action. Further work - by Hefce, by the sector and by government - will be needed to understand why these effects are happening, and what sorts of interventions will be most effective in bringing about positive change.\"\n\nBut Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said:\"Dividing the school population into'state' and'private' is too crude to yield anything of value. \n\n\"The majority of our pupils' A-levels were graded A  or A* last summer and we note that Hefce, despite their best efforts, are unable to show that our pupils did less well at university than other groups.\"\n\nDr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of high-performing universities, said:\"As the report reiterates, A-level and equivalent qualifications are still, without doubt, the key source of information about academic ability. \n\n\"Students with better A-levels do better in higher education. But Russell Group universities take a range of factors into account when deciding which students are offered a place. \n\n\"So the candidate's qualifications are considered in a broader'context'. The bottom line is we want to give places to the pupils with the qualifications, potential and determination to succeed.\"\n\nThe study also found that students from disadvantaged areas tended to do less well than those from more advantaged areas - even though they had achieved the same A-level grades.\n\nProf Les Ebdon, director of fair access to higher education, said:\"This important research shows that a student's background influences their likely degree outcome. \n\n\"This is a worrying finding, suggesting that disadvantage continues to follow disadvantaged young people, even after they have overcome often significant barriers to get into university.\"\nTL;DR: State school pupils do better at university than independent school candidates who have achieved the same A-level grades, a study shows.\n\nArticle: Senator Bob Corker said Mr Trump was treating the presidency like\"a reality show\". \n\nThe retiring Tennessee lawmaker also said White House staff struggle to\"contain\"Mr Trump.\n\nMr Corker's comments are a remarkable attack on a sitting president from a member of his own party.\n\nMr Corker was considered for the job of secretary of state by Mr Trump last year but they have since fallen out.\n\nTrump could pay high price\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter\n\nDonald Trump has gone after members of his own party before. Most, however, have chosen to grit teeth and suffer in silence.\n\nNot Bob Corker. Maybe there's something liberating about knowing you don't have to face an angry pro-Trump electorate next year. Maybe, as head of the foreign relations committee, the Tennessee senator feels compelled to condemn the havoc he believes Mr Trump is causing to US foreign policy.\n\nThe president hasn't responded to Mr Corker's stinging rebuke yet, but according to a White House official, the president is\"not finished with Corker\".\n\nThe problem for the president is that, although Mr Corker is retiring, he's not leaving the Senate until January 2019. \n\nUntil then, he's chair of a powerful committee and a key vote in a chamber where only few party defections will sink any Republican-backed legislation.\n\nThe president may be settling scores with the Tennessean, but it could come at a high price.\n\nFour ways Corker skewered Trump\n\nFollow @awzurcher\n\nThe senator told the New York Times in a telephone interview on Sunday he was concerned about the president's conduct. \n\n\"I don't think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he's addressing,\"he said.\n\nMr Corker suggested the president - who has repeatedly baited nuclear-armed North Korea -  could put the US on course for\"World War Three\".\n\n\"I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true,\"he added. \n\n\"You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.\"\n\n\"I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him,\"Mr Corker told the newspaper. \n\nThe ill-tempered exchange began on Sunday morning, when Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Corker had begged the president to endorse him for re-election.\n\nMr Trump said he refused. He also accused Mr Corker of being\"largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal\".\n\nMr Corker, who denied the president's account, responded:\"It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. \n\n\"Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.\"\n\nMr Trump is this week expected to de-certify the Obama administration's 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons, a deal he has repeatedly condemned.\n\nLast month Mr Corker - who has said the Iran deal should not be torn up - announced he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections. \n\nMr Corker and Mr Trump previously clashed in August when the senator criticised the president's response to clashes that month between white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nMr Trump's attack followed Mr Corker's expression of support last week for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is widely seen as having been sidelined by the president.\n\nMr Corker said America's top diplomat was\"in an incredibly frustrating place\", where he\"ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported\".\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Tillerson denied rumours that he was about to resign, amid reports he had referred to the president as a moron.\nTL;DR: US President Donald Trump could put the US \"on the path to World War Three\", the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has warned.\n\nArticle: By Mary HaltonScience reporter, BBC News\n\nProposing that the extinct Megalodon, a large prehistoric relative of the great white shark, has survived to the present day, the film follows its subsequent encounter with humanity.\n\nBut how much do we really know about the giant predator?\n\nAnd what impact do shark attack films have on their real subjects?\n\nShark researcher and Megalodon expert Catalina Pimiento from Swansea University wants to break down a few myths.\n\nDead or alive?\n\n\"It's very much extinct,\"says Dr Pimiento.\"There's no way it can be still around.\"\n\nResearchers have pinned the date of Megalodon's extinction at about 2.6 million years ago - roughly when its cousin the great white shark was just becoming established.\n\nIn The Meg, Megalodon has survived the ages in a previously unknown (to humans) area of deep ocean off the coast of China.\n\nHowever, Dr Pimiento points out that Megalodon likely lived in water no more than 200 metres deep, in and around coastal areas. \n\nWe would, she says, have noticed something of Megalodon's size if it was swimming off our shores.\n\nWhat did it look like?\n\nMuch of what we know about the species comes from its teeth, which are some of the only remains that have been preserved.\n\nEstimates of its full body length range from at least 13 metres up to a maximum of 18 metres, or almost the length of two double decker buses.\n\nWhile this dwarfs great white sharks, it's not quite the submarine-crunching 25 metres featured in The Meg.\n\nWhat did it eat?\n\nMelagodon's remarkable size is fascinating to researchers, as an animal that large would have had to work very hard to find enough food.\n\n\"If you think about that on land for example, all the largest animals are herbivores... if you're that big then you need to eat a lot of prey and you need to hunt a lot to find that much food,\"explains Dr Pimiento. \n\n\"So that's why Megalodon is so amazing; because it was a predator and it was huge!\"\n\nAlthough it's very difficult to know much about how Megalodon would have moved and behaved, Dr Pimiento has her suspicions about what kind of hunter it would have been. She hopes to build a 3D model of the shark in order to study this in more detail.\n\n\"If I had to guess, I wouldn't think it was an agile predator. It could even have been more of a scavenger. Sharks are opportunistic, and they will eat anything they can. If they can hunt, they will hunt. If they see a carcass, they will eat the carcass.\"\n\nSo even if we had lived at the same time, a small human snack might not have been worth the energy.\n\nWhy did it die out?\n\nThere's no evidence that Megalodon's remarkable size was the cause of its extinction, but food was almost certainly a factor.\n\nRapidly changing sea levels about 2.6 million years ago impacted the coastal ecosystem that the giant shark inhabited.\n\nOver the course of a few million years, around 36% of sharks, sea turtles, sea birds and marine mammals became extinct.\n\nMegalodon was the last of its lineage of giant sharks, and it was succeeded by smaller, more agile hunters like the great white.\n\nAll publicity is good publicity?\n\nAlthough The Meg's creators put a good deal of research into reviving Megalodon, before adding some artistic licence, previous shark attack films have been thought to affect their real life counterparts.\n\n\"Movies have such an impact,\"says Dr Pimiento.\n\n\"We shouldn't take them lightly. Jaws had a huge impact on the protection of sharks, and a role in giving them a bad reputation. People don't realise how vulnerable they are.\"\n\nIt was speculated that shark populations off the US coast were affected after Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster, with fishers setting out to catch\"trophy sharks.\"\n\nNowadays, sharks are threatened by human encroachment on their hunting grounds, competing for the same prey. \n\nIf Megalodon had survived to encounter humans, it's likely we would be the far greater danger.\n\nFollow Mary on Twitter.\nTL;DR: The Meg, Hollywood's latest shark tale, is opening wide this week in anticipation of summer audiences in the mood for a scare.\n\nArticle: Mohammed Islam was delivering food when he was knocked down in Romiley, Stockport on Friday evening.\n\nThe 53-year-old's Mercedes was found abandoned in Denton on Monday.

The other 50% is divided between students from the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu and Buddhist-dominated Ladakh regions.\n\nNearly 3,000 students currently study on the campus.\n\nHow did the trouble start?\n\nThe crisis began during India's World Twenty20 semi-final clash against the West Indies last week. \n\nReports said that local Kashmiri students supported the West Indies, while all the others cheered for the home team.\n\nWhat began as slogan-shouting soon turned violent and clashes broke out. \n\nA few Kashmiri students told local media that they had been\"thrashed\"in the incident. This led to anger within the Kashmir Valley, made worse by a report by a courier boy named Imtiyaz Sheikh, who complained that\"outsider\"students beat him up when he went to deliver a package at the campus.\n\nClashes broke out again when non-Kashmiri students chanted\"Bharat Mata Ki Jai\"(Victory for mother India) and attempted to hoist the Indian flag at the university.\n\nPolice intervened and allegedly\"seized\"the flag and attempted to restore order. \n\nIndia is currently witnessing a heated debate over the phrase because some Muslims say the line equates the country to a mother\"deity\"and worshipping any god, apart from Allah, is un-Islamic. \n\nA Muslim legislator in the western Indian state of Maharashtra was recently suspended after he refused to say it.\n\nSo why are they protesting now?\n\nThe non-Kashmiri students allege that they are now being harassed by the faculty, most of whom are locals. They said they tried to hold a protest march outside the campus, but were stopped by the police. \n\nClashes broke out between the two sides and led to police baton-charging the protesting students. \n\nWhy was a cricket match the trigger?\n\nControversy over a cricket match in Kashmir is not new.\n\nMany in the valley have regularly cheered for Pakistan. In fact, before the outbreak of militancy in the region in the late 1980s, residents would publicly cheer for teams like Australia and West Indies.\n\nAnd now, with anti-India sentiment running high and with many Kashmiris feeling alienated, such outbursts are not unusual. \n\nWhy are there different versions of the incident? \n\nPolice and unofficial university sources have maintained that the violence was nothing more than a group of senior students trying to settle old scores.\n\nBut some students, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said they felt threatened. \n\n\"We are not safe and we are too afraid to study. The faculty is not good to us and we are scared of the police,\"one of them said. \n\nThe local students allege that the entire incident is a ruse to shift the NIT out of Kashmir.\n\n\"We are a minority in the campus. What can we do? They now think that the Indian government is on their side and they can do anything,\"one of them told the BBC. \n\nHow have authorities reacted?\n\nUniversity authorities and state ministers have downplayed the issue and expressed the confidence that they would be able to resolve matters soon. \n\nBut the federal government has stepped in, sending paramilitary forces and a high-level team to negotiate with the protesting students, thereby minimising the role of the Kashmiri state government and the local police. \n\nApart from that, India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani spoke to Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and asked her to ensure the safety of students from outside the state. \n\nWhat are the implications of the incident?\n\nNIT has now become the latest hotspot in the debate over\"nationalism\"in India.\n\nWhat has happened in the college can be directly compared to recent incidents in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and south India's Hyderabad university, where police action has been taken against students accused of being\"anti-national\".\n\nHowever, the way in which the government rushed paramilitary forces into the university premises, sidelining the state authorities, has caused some concern, both about the future of the new government and the students of the college.\nTL;DR: Tensions remain high at a university in Indian-administered Kashmir following a row sparked by a cricket match.  Students and police clashed  at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Srinagar city, with police using sticks to beat up students. Senior journalist Shujaat Bukhari explains the incident and what has happened so far.\n\nArticle: By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News \n\nThe evidence is found in 1.2-billion-year-old rocks from Scotland.\n\nThese rocks retain signatures of bacterial activity known to occur when there is copious atmospheric oxygen.\n\nThe microbes' behaviour is seen 400 million years further back in time than any previous discovery, the researchers tell the journal Nature.\n\nThe team is not saying complex life existed 1.2 billion years ago, merely that the conditions would have been right for it to start to take hold.\n\n\"We're recording a key stage in the evolution of life on Earth,\"said Professor John Parnell from the University of Aberdeen.\n\n\"The evidence relates to a particular group of microbes that have been very successful through Earth's history and are now found everywhere from glaciers to the deep ocean floor.  \n\n\"These microbes made an important advance by becoming more efficient, which they did through using oxygen in their environment.  So the occurrence of these microbes is a marker for increasing oxygen in the atmosphere,\"he told BBC News.\n\nYellow specks\n\nThe rocks that record their activity are sited today on the coast near Lochinver in the Northwest Highlands, but they comprise sediments that were once at the bottom of an ancient lake bed.\n\nThe researchers do not see the fossil evidence of the microbes themselves - only the chemical traces that they were present and using sulphur in the lake floor as a form of energy.\n\nThese traces are evident in specks of the mineral iron pyrite, better known as\"fool's gold\"for its yellow appearance.  \n\nAnalysis of the sulphur atoms in the pyrite shows them to be of different types, and in particular fractions, which could only have been produced through biological behaviour, say the scientists.\n\n\"There's a certain stage which is achieved by bacteria when they start to work in a more complex way, and they do this by forming a community where some bacteria are turning sulphate into sulphide and there's another lot of bacteria turning the sulphide back to sulphate,\"explained Professor Parnell.\n\n\"And so you start getting cycles of chemical reduction and chemical oxidation, and they drive up the level of fractionation.\"\n\nTrigger events\n\nPrior to the Lochinver discovery, the oldest rocks known to display this sulphur signature were 800 million years old. The new study now indicates oxygen levels in Earth's atmosphere were raised to such a level that the gas was permeating into lake waters and their sediment beds 1.2 billion years ago.\n\nThe type of biochemistry pursued by complex life requires a lot of oxygen but the fact that levels were elevated at this time does not in itself prove such organisms were also present.\n\nThe precise timing of the emergence of complex life on Earth is a topic of intense debate, and marked by claim and counter claim.\n\nCertainly, the earliest indisputable evidence for complex animal life - slug-like organisms called Kimberalla - are not seen until the Ediacaran Period, which came at the end of the last great global glaciation  These fossil remains are found today in 555-million-year-old rocks in Australia and Russia.\n\n\"What we are now showing is that the conditions in the atmosphere were in place [1.2 billion years ago], so it probably needed some other factor to trigger the early evolution of complex life and the fact that the Ediacaran fauna occur after the'snowball Earth' episode suggests those two are linked somehow,\"said Professor Parnell.\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\nTL;DR: Oxygen levels on Earth reached a critical threshold to enable the evolution of complex life much earlier than thought, say scientists. \n\n\n\nArticle: Olivia Campbell-Hardy, from Bury in Greater Manchester, died in the explosion last Monday.\n\nHer family has set up a trust to enable young people to take part in the performing arts - Olivia's\"passion\".\n\nHer father Andrew said:\"Please don't hate in Olivia's name, we choose to love.\"\n\n\"Our memories are of happy times, of fun at family gatherings,\"he said.\n\n\"The ones suffering most are the young people in our family.

My little box room will be all I have to ensure that I'm safe.\"\n\n'Further risk to lives'\n\nIt is a fear echoed by many students among the 2.2 million people asked to shield by the UK government at the start of lockdown, which ended on 1 August.\n\nBut with just weeks before term begins, vulnerable students have said there has been little communication about what they can expect, in part, because universities themselves are grappling with an unprecedented situation.\n\nThe University of Surrey said it plans to\"contact all new students\"to see what support it can offer, and will try to meet specific accommodation requirements. But it said it doesn't actually have any plans in place yet.\n\nThe NUS said a\"lack of clarity\"from many universities about coronavirus measures was\"concerning\".\n\nSara Khan, who looks after student equality for the NUS, said:\"Clear support pathways must be outlined for students moving into accommodation safely and accessing mental health services physically or remotely.\n\n\"A failure to put these plans into action will pose further risk to the lives of students, particularly shielding students.\"\n\nThe lack of specific information is something that worries Jennifer Geminiani who has been shielding for five months due to having the blood disorder Thalassemia, which can lead to complications in the body's organs.\n\nShe is about to start a master's degree in terrorism and politics at the University of St Andrews.\n\nRather than risk living in university accommodation she has decided to pay more for private housing, which she says gives her\"security and certainty\".\n\n\"I'm hoping that the student body will receive regular Covid-19 tests so that people can go safely and without worry to university.\"\n\nShe said her university life was already impacted by coronavirus before the summer break.\n\n\"I worked twice as hard as I used too, because I couldn't see my lecturers.

I am sure the university has put lots of things in place, but it would be nice to know exactly what's going on.\"\n\nThe University of Sussex said its student support team would work with students who have long-term health conditions and those \"anxious about returning to campus\"to find\"reasonable adjustments\"for them.  \n\nBut for those students who are on work placements as part of their degree, the worry around safety is just as acute.\n\nLauren Bradfield has Beh\u00e7et's disease, which causes inflammation of the blood vessels and tissues.\n\nAs a second year student of paramedic sciences at the University of Surrey her hospital placement was cancelled at the start of lockdown to protect her health, but she is worried this will impact the completion of her degree.\n\n\"I am having to choose between my health and my career which is an awful decision to have to make.

They have a complex set of questions that have to help them determine how to categorise patients. There are about 7,500 different codes and a decision has to be made quickly. \n\nUnsurprisingly it leads to mistakes being made. About a quarter of crews dispatched to life-threatening calls in England, which have a target of eight minutes to be reached, are called back before they reach the scene. \n\nA similar situation arises in Northern Ireland, Scotland and, until last year, Wales.\n\nBut faced with growing pressures in the system - in Northern Ireland nearly one in two critical calls are not reached in eight minutes and in England it is over a third - ambulance bosses have started to re-think their approach.\n\nThe answer they seem to be reaching is to scrap the eight-minute target for all but the most immediately life-threatening cases.\n\nWales has already done this. Last October it reduced the number of calls it aims to answer in eight minutes to about 5% of the total, whereas previously it aimed to get to about a third in that timescale. \n\nScotland introduced a similar system last week and England has started piloting its own version in three areas this year. \n\nWales, like the rest of the UK, was struggling to respond to life-threatening calls within the eight-\n\nSo what gets chucked out of the eight-minute group? All sorts. Strokes, some road traffic accidents, people having fits and those experiencing chest pains.\n\nThis sounds radical - and risky. But ambulance bosses suggest it is not. Take stroke, for example. All the evidence suggests that what matters most is that a patient gets to a properly equipped stroke unit within an hour for tests and treatment. Whether an ambulance crew reaches them in eight, 10 or 12 minutes is of little consequence.\n\nAnd by scrapping the eight-minute target for all but the most obviously life-threatening, the bosses argue ambulance services get the breathing space they need to properly consider whether an immediate dispatch is necessary, thereby cutting back on the unnecessary journeys.\n\nAnd here's the clever bit: by doing that response times across the board improve because there are more ambulances available. Or that's the theory anyway.\n\nThe problem is we just don't really know. There has been little published on what impact this has had in the places where it is happening. \n\nA major report on the changes is due to be published next spring. That will be telling. \n\nIf ambulance bosses have got this right it could prove to be the solution to the incredible pressures on the service that are being documented by the BBC today.

Casualty figures remain unclear.\n\nLTTE military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthirayan told bbcsinhala.com that he was yet to find out details of the incident.\n\nIf confirmed, the attack will be the latest in a series of sea battles between the Tigers and Sri Lankan forces.\n\nLast week both sides agreed to take part in peace talks in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\n\nOn Saturday, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has told the BBC he was hoping for a political solution at next month's talks.\nTL;DR: Military sources in Sri Lanka say the navy, backed by air force planes, has sunk a ship alleged to be carrying arms for the Tamil Tiger separatist rebels.\n\nArticle: Chris CookPolicy editor, BBC Newsnight\n\nEarly in the parliament, Labour said their preferred policy was to introduce a \u00a36,000 upper limit on what universities in England can charge students each year - not \u00a39,000, as it currently stands. But they haven't committed to it - and there are a range of good reasons why they might not.\n\nFirst, it would rile the universities. Labour has sought to soothe their concerns by promising university vice-chancellors it would make up the difference in their institutions' income. \n\nBut this is probably not a good deal for the universities, who have no guarantee that this money - which could eventually increase the usual measure of public spending by around \u00a32bn a year - would not be taken from their other state-backed budgets. Nor do they know how it would be distributed.\n\nWhy does this matter? Why care about academics? Well, because the vice-chancellors could - to use a word of the moment -\"weaponise\"it against Labour.\n\nRemember, the English universities are wily campaigners - they have won all their fights in recent years. \n\nThey could, for example, start querying Labour's ability to find the extra money while remaining inside its fiscal rules. Having the leaders of our top universities question Labour's spending plans would play into the party's terror about looking fiscally conservative. \n\nFears'not realised'\n\nSecond, the greatest fears surrounding the rise in tuition fees have not come to pass. Students cheerfully pay up, even poorer ones. And any concerns that the current student loan system is unaffordable also look rather overdone - I have explained why here.\n\nThird, the beneficiaries of a fee cut may not be who you think they are, because of the way that the loan system works. And it's not totally clear you would want to spend \u00a32bn a year helping them, especially since they would not feel the benefit for a few years. \n\nIf English students go to an English university their up-to-\u00a39,000 fees are covered by a student loan, which is a so-called\"income contingent\"debt. That means you only make repayments which you can afford to pay.\n\nSo graduates need repay none of their loans while they are earning less than a threshold, which now set at \u00a321,000. When they earn above that level, they repay a share of their wages over that benchmark to the Student Loans Company, a public company.\n\nOnce you finish paying off your loan, the repayments stop. But if you don't earn enough, you will not be asked to repay your loan in full. After 30 years, any outstanding debts are written off. \n\nSo it is a progressive policy - people who earn more pay more for their education. \n\nWho would benefit from lower fees?\n\nSo what would the effect of the changes be? I asked education economist Dr Gavan Conlon of London Economics to help with some maths to explain. \n\nDr Conlon estimates that around the top 60% of male graduate earners would roughly pay off a student loan with current tuition fee levels. Though someone at the 60% line would only just finish - such a person who started university last October would finish repaying their loan in 2047, as it got written off.\n\nIf you cut fees to \u00a36,000, that person - and men who earn more than them - are big winners. I reckon a typical person at that point in the income distribution might repay their fee loans three years sooner. \n\nA fee cut is also good for people who would not repay in full with fees at \u00a39,000, but would if fees were at \u00a36,000. Dr Conlon estimates that this group is men who are not in the top 60%, but are in the top 70%. It helps them, too - but by less. \n\nWhat about men who earn too little to repay their loans even at \u00a36,000? That bottom 30% would get no benefit whatsoever from a fee cut. \n\nThere's an interesting gender element to this, too. You'll notice I talked about men. The results are quite different for women. Dr Conlon estimates that, with fees at \u00a39,000, only the top 20% earning women repay their fees. At \u00a36,000, the top half will.\n\nThat is because, in brief, women earn less. \n\nThe general shape of the story is clear. Cutting tuition fees, counter-intuitively, helps better-off graduates the most, and it helps them in the 2030s and 2040s.\n\nThat is why spending money on a fee cut is not as simple as it seems. And why targeted measures might be a less complicated way to spend money in higher education, helping part-time and postgraduate students, for example. \n\nThat's an area where higher education policy is, by common consensus, still struggling.\nTL;DR: Labour is toying with the idea of fiddling with the English university tuition fees system, but doing so may have counterintuitive effects.\n\nArticle: James Jack, 57, was found on Saturday in the Streap area, near Fort William, in the West Highlands, which is still under heavy winter conditions. \n\nIt followed a search by the Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team and an RAF rescue helicopter in the Glenfinnan area.\n\nNorthern Constabulary said Mr Jack, who was known as Jim, was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire.\n\nIn a statement, his family said:\"The family wish to thank both the Lochaber and RAF Mountain Rescue and emergency services for their efforts. \n\n\"We also are extremely grateful to Northern Constabulary for their help and support at this difficult time.\"\n\nWalkers are warned that tackling the Streap mountain in the winter requires a lot of experience and skill.\nTL;DR: A hillwalker's body has been found in the Scottish Highlands following a mountain rescue search.\n\nArticle: Protesters are concerned the planned development for Ham Woods in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, will impact on wildlife and the ecology.\n\nThe application will be reviewed by the Welsh Government's planning inspectorate after the application was rejected by council planners. \n\nLandowner Oota Property said it would boost tourism in the area.\n\nThe plans include 11 tree tents, which would either be suspended between trees in the woodland or built on stilts. \n\nShowers, toilets and a kitchen block would also be built.

After signing in with a username and password the app will ask to send a text message or email with a one-time six-digit code. Once the code is entered the user will have access to the app and be able to view footage from outdoor and indoor cameras.\n\nIf owners do not use their mobile apps for 30 day, they will be required the enter the verification code again when they do ultimately return to the software. But otherwise they will not be required to enter the code on each use.\n\nLast week, Nest - Google's home security device - began requiring two-factor authentication.\n\nTwo-factor authentication was an option for Ring users before, but it was not the default setting.\n\nCritics pointed to the fact that even when users logged in from a new device they were not asked for a second verification.\n\nThat meant that to get access to someone's Ring footage all a hacker would need was a login ID and password. Because many people use the same login credentials for multiple accounts experts stress using a password alone is not a very secure system.\n\nThe new security steps will apply to access Ring's web services and its app - including its Neighbors app where Ring users can share video footage.\n\nMs Rouhi also said Ring was changing the way it shared data with outside analytics firms. \n\nLast month, the Electronic Frontier Foundation published a study showing Ring was sharing personally identifiable information with third-party analytics firms - something Ring did not disclose to its customers.\n\nRing said this helped the firm improve its software. Ring said it has paused the data sharing for most third-party partners until it develops a way for users to opt in or out.\n\nWhy Amazon knows so much about you\n\nOur technology desk editor, Leo Kelion, asked Amazon to send all the data they had collected on him over the years.

I can't help the fact that I have lost all my family to the drugs. And it is hard.\"\n\nJacquie, who began taking heroin at the age of 17 and is now trying to kick the habit, said she could not remember a time when the family wasn't affected by drugs. \n\nShe is the last remaining member of her immediate family - who all lived and died in the Fife town of Glenrothes.\n\nThe first family death came in 2005, when Jacquie's father Thomas died at a property in Glenrothes. He was 40 and his death was attributed to\"adverse effects of heroin\".\n\nTwo years later, in 2007, the first of Jacquie's sisters, Kayleigh, died of a morphine overdose at the age of 21.\n\nTheir mother Margaret, who was hooked on painkillers and had dabbled with heroin, died in 2010, due to\"adverse effects of opiates\". She was 44.\n\nIn May 2018, after a suicide attempt, Jacquie's 37-year-old brother Colin was found dead at a house in Glenrothes as a result of\"multi-drug intoxication\".\n\nAnd then five months later, second sister Emma died aged 29 after taking a cocktail of methadone and diazepam.\n\n'I couldn't cope'\n\nJacquie, whom BBC Scotland is not fully naming, continued:\"I would like to think in my head that they would've been able to kick the habit.\n\n\"But in reality, no. My dad was only on it four years and he committed suicide with heroin. My mum was just the same - she started with Tramadol and it led to her taking lines here and there.\"\n\nMother and sister - Margaret died aged 44 and Kayleigh died aged 21\n\nJacquie said her own battle with addiction started in high school where dabbling with alcohol and cannabis escalated to harder drugs.\n\nShe began taking heroin at the age of 17, when she was receiving NHS treatment for alcohol abuse, and her longest period of sobriety was seven years in her mid-20s.\n\n\"I took a mixture of everything really,\"she said.\n\n\"I would take diazepam, any downer really, any sleeping tablets or suppressant. \n\n\"I would have sleeping tablets from the doctor like Zopiclone. It would help with the buzz, to block out everything that was going on in life. With losing all my family, I couldn't cope.\"\n\nBrother - Colin died aged 37\n\nJacquie told BBC Scotland how she has struggled to cope after losing her brother and sister in quick succession last year.\n\n\"My brother died in May and I'd only just been speaking to him again for five weeks,\"she explained.\n\n\"We'd agreed that me, him and Emma would all go to bereavement counselling to work through everything we'd lost.\n\n\"We would do it, the three of us, so that it would help us bond that brother-and-sister relationship that I desperately wanted and obviously they did as well.\n\n\"I got the phone call from Emma at three in the morning. The police had chapped her up to say that Colin had passed away. She was distraught, devastated, screaming down the phone.\n\n\"I just spent that day with Emma. She was an absolute mess. Then six months down the line, Emma was gone.\n\n\"I've never been right since. I've never been right from any of them but Emma was the worst by far.\"\n\nFather - Thomas died aged 40\n\nJacquie said drug abuse and its affect on different generations of families largely remains a taboo subject but she wanted to speak out to show people what it is like to live with the impact of the problem. \n\nShe said:\"Even if I can help one more family, then I have done good.\n\n\"I just want people to see that we are still a family. We are not animals, monsters or whatever people would call a family of heroin users.\"\n\nOn her own addiction problems, the 34-year-old, who has been on methadone for 15 years, said she was\"100% ready to be clean and stay that way\"but acknowledged the path ahead for her was difficult. \n\nSister - Emma died aged 29\n\nIf you've been affected by issues explored in this article, BBC Action Line has links to helpful resources including information about drugs, emotional distress and bereavement.\nTL;DR: A woman from Fife has told how her father, mother, two sisters and brother all died because of drugs.\n\nArticle: Carpenters placed a wooden box over the marble statue of Sir Thomas Picton at Cardiff City Hall on Friday.\n\nCouncillors had voted to remove the memorial in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nPermission to remove the effigy is being sought from the Welsh Government as the building is Grade I-listed. \n\nHailed as a hero of the Battle of Waterloo and the Napoleonic Wars, Pembrokeshire-born Picton was commemorated with the statue in 1916.\n\nBut he has been cited by anti-racism campaigners for his cruelty while serving as governor of the then British colony of Trinidad in the early 19th Century.\n\nLord Mayor of Cardiff Dan De'Ath had called for the statue's removal in June after protesters toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol.\n\nCouncillor De'Ath, who described Picton as a\"monster\", said he was\"very pleased with the way we've chosen to do it, democratically\".\n\n\"It's hugely symbolic that it's coming down,\"he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\n\"It's part of our history. We're not destroying history - we're making history. \n\n\"It's far more appropriate for Sir Thomas to be in one of our excellent museums rather than here, right at the heart of democracy in the capital.\"\n\nAdrian Robson, leader of the Tory opposition group on Cardiff council, had proposed placing a plaque next to it explaining Picton's role as a slave owner.\n\n\"It's essential that future generations can learn about the good and the bad of this man's actions,\"he said. \n\nCardiff council will now apply to the Welsh Government for permission to alter the building, which could take more than 20 weeks.\nTL;DR: A statue of a 19th Century slave owner has been covered over after councillors voted for it to be removed from\u00a0a gallery of Welsh heroes.\n\nArticle: By Judith  BurnsBBC News education reporter\n\nThe 126,000-signature document will be given to the Department for Education. \n\nCampaigners say many families cannot afford the higher cost of a break during the school holidays. \n\nThe DfE said it was giving schools more freedom to set term dates - potentially meaning parents could book cheaper holidays.\n\n'Educational'\n\nUntil last month, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in\"special circumstances\".  \n\nSince 1 September, head teachers have no longer been able to grant any absence outside school holidays except under\"exceptional circumstances\". \n\nThe reference to the 10-day limit has been removed from the regulations.\n\nA petition against the ban, started by a parent and hosted on the 38-Degrees Campaigns By You website, had attracted 126,275 signatures by Tuesday evening.  \n\nThe petition says the ban will\"adversely affect\"families who cannot afford the higher prices charged to holidaymakers during the school holidays. \n\n\"Also not all businesses can allow their staff to be off all at the same time\", says the petition.\n\n\"All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year.\"\n\nCraig Langman, the parent who started the petition, told BBC News his six-year-old son still recalls a holiday the family took to Rome during term-time two years ago and has done school projects based on the trip.  \n\n\"It was probably more educational than being in school to be honest. \n\n'Blanket ban'\n\n\"He still remembers the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum.\"\n\nMr Langman says the cost of breaks during the school holidays can be three times as much as during term-time. \n\n\"I am not asking kids to have a guaranteed extra two weeks on top of their existing 10 weeks' holiday each year - but this blanket ban on term-time holidays with the threat of a fine is almost killing families.\"\n\nHe argues that the decision as to whether to grant a request for extra days off school should remain with head teachers.   \n\n\"I feel that most MPs in the government had holidays with their parents when they were younger so why do they think they have the power to stop our children's generation from enjoying the same lifestyle,\"says Mr Langman.\n\n\"Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else.\"\n\nA DfE spokesperson said:\"If children aren't in school they lose out on valuable learning time and have to waste more time catching up. That's why children shouldn't be taken out of school during term time unless absolutely necessary. \n\n\"We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates, for example David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June. This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September.\n\n\"We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families.\"\nTL;DR: A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking holidays during term-time will be delivered later.\n\nArticle: Excavations behind the museum in Dorchester's High Street began on Monday.\n\nThe dig follows demolition of several smaller buildings ahead of a \u00a315m upgrade to the 19th Century, Grade I listed building.\n\nThe extension is due to be completed in 2020.\n\nRichard McConnell of Context One Heritage and Archaeology said he anticipated the team would be there into August, depending on what was found.\n\nHe said:\"There is a known Roman Road that runs through the site, although most of it is under buildings. We also have all the post-medieval intrusion. \n\n\"The pot is quite modern - 18th or 19th Century. We are in the very upper layers at the moment so we have to take it in chronological order. \n\n\"There's quite a lot of Roman material like pottery, but it's very mixed.\"\n\nWhen complete, the extension will house new galleries to allow the museum to display more if its four million artefacts. \n\nCurrently only 1.5% of the collection can be be displayed.\n\nThe plans also include a learning centre, library, cafe and shop.\n\nThe project is being part funded by a \u00a311.3m National Heritage Lottery Fund grant.\nTL;DR: Archaeologists found Roman pottery and a centuries-old vase on their first day at the site of a planned extension to Dorset County Museum.\n\nArticle: By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter\n\nReferring to the misuse of\"deeply personal\"data, he said it was being\"weaponised against us with military efficiency\".\n\n\"We shouldn't sugar-coat the consequences,\"he added.\"This is surveillance.\"\n\nThe strongly-worded speech presented a striking defence of user privacy rights from a tech firm's chief executive.\n\nMr Cook also praised the EU's new data protection regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nThe new law came into force in May.\n\nMr Cook's speech was made in Brussels, at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners.\n\nThe Apple boss described in some detail what he called the\"data industrial complex\", noting that billions of dollars were traded on the basis of people's\"likes and dislikes\",\"wishes and fears\"or\"hopes and dreams\"- the kind of data points tracked by tech firms and advertisers.\n\nHe warned that the situation\"should make us very uncomfortable, it should unsettle us\".\n\nAnd the trade in personal data served only to enrich the companies that collect it, he added.\n\nMr Cook went on to commend the EU's GDPR, which places stricter rules on how personal data is handled by businesses and organisations.\n\n'Follow EU's lead'\n\n\"This year, you've shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone,\"he said.\n\n\"It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead.\n\n\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States.\"\n\nThe remark was met with applause from the conference audience.\n\n\"I think it is striking that he's saying this,\"said Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group.\n\n\"It's the kind of thing you normally hear from civil society organisations.\"\n\nMr Killock told the BBC that he thought the call for a US privacy law was\"extremely important\".\n\nHe also suggested that Mr Cook may have been motivated by commercial interests.\n\n\"US companies are losing trust and without that trust they cannot make the digital economy function as well as it should,\"said Mr Killock, referring to the negative public reaction surrounding data breaches and cases of data misuse.\n\nHowever, Prof Mark Elliot at Manchester University argued Mr Cook did not go far enough.\n\n\"The implication of fully functioning privacy in a digital democracy is that individuals would control and manage their own data and organisations would have to request access to that data rather than the other way round,\"he said.\n\nApple has long been committed to privacy protection. \n\nThe firm was famously locked in a dispute with the FBI over the fact that it would not help the bureau access data on the phone of a dead gunman who was involved in the San Bernardino shooting in 2015.\n\nMark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, chief executives of Facebook and Google, will also appear at the conference later this week in the form of pre-recorded video messages.\nTL;DR: Apple chief executive Tim Cook has demanded a tough new US data protection law, in an unusual speech in Europe.\n\nArticle: Following allegations of vote tampering, a recount and a lengthy legal battle, the election commission declared Mr Ali the winner on Sunday and he was sworn in hours later.\n\nHis rival, outgoing president David Granger, said he would take his allegations of fraud to the high court. \n\nOil giant Exxon Mobil recently began producing oil off Guyana's coast.\n\nThe discovery of huge oil reserves in Guyanese waters over the past years meant that the election was much more closely watched than previous ones as the new president will be the one to administer the windfall resulting from the find. \n\nWhat happened in the election?\n\nThe election on 2 March pitted the 75-year-old incumbent David Granger, of the People's National Congress, against 40-year-old Irfaan Ali of the People's Progressive Party.\n\nMr Granger declared victory days after the vote but international electoral observers said counting in Guyana's most populous electoral district, Region Four, had been\"interrupted\"and was\"incomplete\".\n\nThe opposition alleged that the result in Region Four had been inflated in Mr Granger's favour.\n\nGuyana's Supreme Court initially ordered a partial recount but after weeks of wrangling, a full recount was held.\n\nPreliminary data suggested the opposition had won the election but the Guyana Elections Commission (GECOM) did not declare Mr Ali as the winner until Sunday.\n\nGECOM also announced that Mr Ali's coalition had won a narrow majority 33 of the 65 seats in parliament with Mr Granger's A Partnership for National Unity coalition winning 31 seats and another coalition claiming the remaining seat.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe election was the first to be held after the US oil giant Exxon made one of the world's biggest discoveries of oil in deep waters off Guyana's coast.\n\nThe discovery could put Guyana among the world's top oil producers and is expected to massively boost its economy.\n\nOne of the main topics of the presidential campaign was how to use the windfall from the discovery.\n\nMr Ali and his party have been critical of the contract the outgoing government signed with Exxon saying it was not favourable enough to Guyana. \n\nWhat next?\n\nMr Granger said that while he respected\"the lawful consequences\"of the announcement by the elections commission declaring Mr Ali the winner, he would take the allegations of electoral fraud to the country's supreme court. He also appealed to his supporters to remain peaceful. \n\nMr Ali called for unity saying that\"there is only one future and that future requires a united Guyana, that future requires a strong Guyana\".\n\nHe also said that he would be naming his cabinet soon and promised\"a government that is accessible and one that will be more than willing to share with you information as we work on building our Guyana in the interest of all\".\nTL;DR: Five months after a general election, the opposition candidate Irfaan Ali has been sworn in as Guyana's president.\n\nArticle: Large shops and supermarkets must remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from view by December this year. Smaller shops must comply by April 2015. \n\nHealth Minister Lesley Griffiths said the ban would protect children from the harm caused by smoking.\n\nAnti-smoking group Ash said it was a\"significant step\".\n\nRetailers will be able to display one price list at the point of sale and an illustrated price list will also be available to customers on request.\n\nThe list will not be left out on display.\n\n'Death'\n\nMs Griffiths said:\"Smoking is the greatest preventable cause of illness, disability and premature death in Wales and accounts for more than 5,600 deaths every year. \n\n\"Evidence shows the display of tobacco products in shops can promote smoking by young people and undermine the resolve of adult smokers who are trying to quit.\"\n\nThe Welsh government's aim is to reduce adult smoking rates to 16% by 2020. \n\nAsh chief executive Elen de Lacy said:\"Research after point of sale displays had been banned in Ireland showed that compliance was high among retailers, young people became less confident that they would be able to purchase cigarettes from shops, and were less able to recall brands, with a drop from 80% to 22% after it was implemented.\"\nTL;DR: Cigarettes will be banned from display in stores in Wales, it has been announced.\n\nArticle: Coroner Jim Kitson said the inquest into the death of 11-year-old Francis Rowntree in 1972 would be\"severely hampered\"if he could not attend.\n\nHe said the man's heart condition had to be a factor when deciding whether to compel him to give evidence. \n\nThe coroner told the preliminary hearing it was a\"fine balancing act\". \n\nDisputed\n\nFrancis was playing with friends at the Divis Flats complex off the Falls Road in west Belfast in April 1972 when he was struck on the head by the rubber bullet. He died in hospital several days later.\n\nControversy surrounds the shooting, with disputed claims about whether the young boy was struck directly or hit by a ricochet, and if the bullet had been doctored to make it potentially cause more injury.\n\nThe former Royal Anglian Regiment member who fired the rubber bullet is known to the court as soldier B.\n\nA barrister for the Ministry of Defence told the hearing that soldier B's consultant cardiologist had expressed\"significant reservations\"about his fitness to attend, in a report produced for the coroner's court. \n\n\"It appears on the face of it to be quite a severe condition involving multiple medical interventions over the years,\"the lawyer said.\n\nHe added:\"The likelihood of a heart attack or death would be small but not zero. \n\n\"There is a significant risk to the health of this man to compel him to give evidence.\"\n\nA barrister representing the Rowntree family said a number of steps could be taken to make the witness feel at ease.\n\nShe suggested the former soldier could give evidence via video-link; there could be regular breaks in the hearing; medical assistance could be on standby and the court could be partially cleared.\n\nShe told the coroner:\"You know the gravity of the case and you know he's essentially the key witness and very important to the case.\"\n\nMr Kitson said:\"This is a key witness and clearly the inquest would be severely hampered if this witness is not in attendance, but I'm acutely aware of the impact on this man's health.\n\n\"It's a fine balancing act between the two prerogatives and pressures - I will reflect on this very carefully.\"\n\nThe inquest is due to begin on 27 April.\nTL;DR: A coroner has said he will reflect carefully on whether a soldier who fired a rubber bullet that killed a boy is too ill to give evidence.\n\nArticle: News from Elsewhere......media reports from around the world, found by BBC Monitoring\n\nThe move is being considered in the Yamalo-Nenets region of northwest Siberia, as a way to help police maintain law and order in the difficult terrain, the Izvestia newspaper reports.

Any with worrying results would be referred for more testing and treatment as necessary.\n\nCurrently, women aged 25-49 are invited for cervical screening every three years, dropping to every five years between the ages of 50 and 64. \n\nThis means the average woman will undergo around 12 conventional smears in a lifetime. \n\nProfessor Sasieni says it is not that the old method is bad, more that it is now outdated and involves testing women many more times than necessary.\n\nData suggests one in five women do not turn up to have smears when invited. \n\nProfessor Sasieni says if HPV testing were to be rolled out from next year, it could be used nationally by 2015.\n\n\"With continued high coverage of HPV vaccination and targeting of screening resources towards unvaccinated women, cervical cancer should become a truly rare disease. \n\n\"And if the government plan for this change now, they could save hundreds of millions of pounds in the long run,\"he said. \n\nIn the UK, girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the HPV vaccine that protects against two strains of HPV, types 16 and 18. Girls have three injections over six months, given by a nurse.\n\nUptake in English schools has reached about 80% and in Scotland 90%.\n\nDr Lesley Walker, Cancer Research UK's director of cancer information, said the very high uptake of the vaccine in the UK had been a real success story.\n\n\"This is exciting and poses interesting questions for the screening programme in terms of the best way to screen women in the future who have been vaccinated.\n\n\"But for now it remains vitally important that all women continue to take up the invitation to go for screening when they receive it.\"\n\nMore than 2,800 women a year in the UK are diagnosed with cervical cancer and almost 1,000 die from it every year.\n\nProfessor Julietta Patnick, Director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, said they were looking at how best to incorporate HPV testing into their current screening programme. \n\n\"Any plans to use HPV testing as a primary screening method will require rigorous investigation and testing, as well as the development of robust quality assurance protocols and standards, before it could be implemented.\"\nTL;DR: Women would need far fewer smears if the NHS switched to a new way of screening for cervical cancer, a Cancer Research UK scientist has said.\n\nArticle: The 25-year-old said\"the struggle for our people\"brought her together with Abid Shamdeen.\n\nThe announcement comes days after the fourth anniversary of the IS attack on Ms Murad's village, Kocho.\n\nSix of her brothers were killed in the massacre, and she was kidnapped.\n\nDuring her time in captivity, she was bought and sold several times, and was subjected to sexual and physical abuse - including gang rape.\n\nMs Murad shared her story after managing to escape, and was appointed the first UNODC Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking in 2016.\n\nOn Monday, both Ms Murad and Mr Shamdeen shared a picture of themselves as they announced their engagement.\n\nIt is unclear exactly when the couple met.

They are not laughing any more.\"\n\n\"The millennial generation has basically woken up and their tastes are rather dramatically changing in affluent countries, substituting animal for plant-based proteins.\"\n\nGreen support\n\nEnvironmental groups support plant-based proteins, hoping that their rise will curb meat consumption.\n\n\"The world's top scientists have consistently said we need to more than halve our meat consumption to prevent climate breakdown,\"said Richard George, head of forests at Greenpeace. \n\n\"Pea protein is undoubtedly one option among many. Changing our eating habits won't be easy, but the more options we have, the better our chance of success.\"\n\nBut the rise of pea protein needs to be kept in perspective.\n\nGlobal meat consumption is running at 330 million tonnes a year, a million times greater than the annual output of pea protein.\n\nAnd with meat consumption expected to continue to grow, the humble pea is likely to remain pretty humble for a while yet.",

His friends believe that after a secret trial, Prof Tiyip was convicted of separatism and sentenced to death.\n\nProf Tiyip is a Muslim Uighur, and rights groups say he was caught up in a wider persecution of Uighur intellectuals as China tackles what it says is a separatist, terrorist threat.\n\n\"There are hundreds of Uighur academics and professionals swept up into this mass internment campaign,\"Michael Caster, a researcher and author of The People's Republic of the Disappeared, told the BBC. \n\n\"This is targeting community, cultural, and intellectual leaders; it is tantamount to cultural genocide.\"\n\nFellow academics fear that if he is still alive and detained, Prof Tayip faces imminent execution.\n\nWho is Tashpolat Tiyip?\n\nUntil his disappearance, Tashpolat Tiyip was an esteemed professor of geography at Xinjiang University, which like all Chinese universities is an official state institution. \n\nA member of the local Uighur community in Xinjiang, he had studied geography in his home province, and after a stint in Japan, returned home to his alma mater to teach.\n\nHe'd been active in international academic circles - receiving a title from France's Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes - and was part of a tight-knit international network of scholars in his field. \n\nHe was also a member of the Chinese Communist Party and in 2010, he became president of Xinjiang University, a position he held until his disappearance. \n\nHow did he disappear?\n\nThe proceedings against Prof Tiyip were shrouded in secrecy and there's no official record of what happened to him. \n\nFriends say that in 2017, he was on his way to Europe for a conference and to launch a co-operation with a German university. But at Beijing airport he was stopped and told he had to return to Xinjiang's capital Urumqi. That's where the trail ends, a former colleague of the professor told the BBC from the US. \n\nHe never returned home and his friends and relatives were soon questioned over corruption allegations around him. \n\nEventually, the family heard news he had been convicted of separatism and had received the death penalty, the former colleague explains - but China has never confirmed anything about his case. \n\nWorking as a researcher in the US, she is herself a Uighur originally from Xinjiang and asked to remain anonymous so as not to endanger her own friends and family back home. \n\nChina's hidden camps\n\nShe says the crackdown has created an atmosphere of horror where\"everyone feel like they're being watched all the time\". \n\n\"There is a huge sense of fear - people tell me they sleep in their clothes because no-one knows whether at night they might be taken away.\n\n\"A friend has described it to me as China waging a war of fear. And that friend has also disappeared since then.\"\n\nWhere is Tashpolat Tiyip now?\n\nUN experts and rights groups say China is holding about one million Uighurs and other Muslims and minorities in detention camps.\n\nChina doesn't deny the massive operation, but says it is preventing terrorism and separatism by providing education to those detained, helping them to better integrate into mainstream Chinese society. \n\nProf Tiyip's friends say contacting loved ones in Xinjiang is difficult and only possible with code words to avoid alerting the authorities, who monitor communications. There are reports of people being detained for even having WhatsApp on their phone. \n\n\"When we talk to them, we can't use his name,\"the former colleague explains.\"For instance we have to ask how the patient is, whether the doctors already gave a diagnosis, or whether he's been released from hospital.\"\n\n\"That's the only way that relatives can tell us anything.\"\n\nMr Tiyip's family believe he is still alive. They have also heard that he and other academics convicted of alleged separatism are used as scare examples in propaganda videos shown in detention centres. \n\nMr Caster says the pattern of vanishing into a secret justice system is typical. \n\n\"The Chinese State does not want people to know about him and his ongoing incommunicado detention fits the textbook definition of an enforced disappearance.\"\n\nWhat's been the reaction?\n\nSince the disappearance of Mr Tiyip, supporters have again and again tried to draw attention to his case. \n\nThey believe he was given a two-year suspended death sentence - if so that period would now be ending and amid the uncertainty there are new efforts to rally support. \n\nEarlier this month, the American Association of Geographers (AAG) called for his release in a letter signed by more than 1,300 academics from around the world.\n\n\"Tashpolat Tiyip's arrest, detention and death sentence is a devastating threat to intellectual and scientific freedom in China and around the globe,\"according to Dr Gary Langham of the AAG. \n\nThe French university that had awarded the honorary degree also EPHE also urged for the release of Mr Tiyip, warning that it was part of a\"wave of Chinese repression that few people in Europe know about\".\n\nRights group Amnesty International in September described the trial as\"secret and grossly unfair\"and has called for urgent action to urge China to release them. \n\nScholars at Risk has also released a statement, urging China to\"immediately intervene\"to halt the execution and\"secure his unconditional release\".\n\nThe group warns that\"in addition to the harm to Dr Tiyip and his family, such incidents have a chilling effect on academic freedom and suggest an attempt to undermine academic communities and limit free expression\".\n\nLast year, Pen America condemned the detention of the academic along with several other Uighur writers as\"an outrageous abdication of the rule of law, and a clear demonstration of the government's broad-scale attack on Uyghur intellectual life under the guise of preventing'separatism'\". \n\n\"The fact that several prominent Uyghur intellectuals have disappeared only to re-emerge months later, sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, tells you all you need to know about the state of free expression in Xinjiang today,\"Summer Lopez, senior director of Free Expression Programs at Pen America, said.\n\nIs Prof Tiyip the only one?\n\nA wave of academics have vanished in China's Xinjiang province. Among the first high profile arrests was economist Ilham Tohti who was convicted of separatism and sentenced to life in prison in 2014. \n\nMr Tohti had been a moderate critic of Beijing's policies towards Uighurs, questioning the government's role in persistent violent confrontations between Uighurs and the dominant Han Chinese.\n\nLast month, he was awarded the Council of Europe's Vaclaw Havel Prize for human rights.\n\nAnother example is anthropologist Rahile Dawut, also of Xinjiang University. \n\nLike Mr Tiyip, she'd long been praised by Chinese authorities as a model academic, applauded for their integration within the Chinese and global academic context. \n\nMs Dawut disappeared in late 2017 and has not been heard of since. Efforts to understand what happened to her or what she might have been charged with, have been futile.\nTL;DR: Until 2017, Tashpolat Tiyip was a model academic, head of Xinjiang University, globally connected, and with an honorary degree from a prestigious Paris university.\n\nArticle: The energy giant had 5.22 million gas and electricity customers at the end of the third quarter - down from 5.34 million in the same period last year.\n\nProfits also slumped for its generation and supply business, following a drop in demand.\n\nDomestic electricity demand fell year-on-year by 6.8%, while gas demand was down by 6.6%.\n\nScottish Power, which is owned by Iberdrola of Spain, attributed the falls to milder weather in 2017.\n\n'Less output'\n\nEarnings for the division before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were down year-on-year by more than 75%, at \u00a346.5m.\n\nThe company's retail business saw earnings down by \u00a392.9m, while its generation business posted a profits fall of \u00a347.7m as a result of\"less output and lower margins on ancillary services\".    \n\nEarnings were also down slightly for its energy networks division, which the group said was in line with expectations.\n\nHowever, there was better news for its renewables arm, which saw EBITDA rise by 34.7% year-on-year, to \u00a3211.6m.\n\nScottish Power said total wind power production had increased by 34% so far this year, with a 37% uplift in onshore wind alone during the third quarter, compared with a year ago.\n\nChief corporate officer Keith Anderson said:\"In retail, we have more customers on fairer deals than any other'big six' suppliers and we are the only bigger company to have increased its market share since 2011.  \n\n\"We believe that putting our existing customers before new customers is the best way to compete in this marketplace.

It's filled with\"lots of critters\"- black bears, the odd grizzly or polar bear, moose, wolverines, wolves, minks, otters, and grouse. \n\nThis time of year,\"there'll be blueberries pretty much everywhere, cattails and roots,\"says Mr MacDonald.  \n\n\"You can do a lot if you know what you're doing. If you don't know what you're looking for and you don't know what you're doing, you'd have a very difficult time.\"\n\nAnyone trying to survive would need some basic skills, he says. \n\nThat includes knowing how to manage exposure to the cold and the heat, how to build fires and shelters, how to find and purify water and how to obtain food. \n\nFinding something to eat is not the end of the challenge, however. There is the added problem of needing to clean up after your meal. \n\nOne wildlife threat probably comes from the bears. Food attracts bears to camps, which is why it's recommended you hide your food in bags in trees, for example if you're overnight in bear country. \n\nThe average temperature in the region in mid-summer is about 22C (71F) during the day and about 10C (50F) at night.  \n\nRock outcroppings, thick stands of trees, and empty cabins - used for hunting and fishing or as vacation homes - along the waterways could all provide possible shelter. \n\nMr MacDonald says dehydration is always a concern for anyone in the wild, and can lead to injuries from falling or tripping, or put a person at a higher risk for hypothermia or heat exhaustion. \n\nThen there are the insects. \n\n\"The bugs can drive you crazy,\"he says. \n\nMosquitoes thrive at night and in the shade and\"when you step out into the sun, the mosquitoes aren't there, [but] the black flies take over, so do the deer flies. And they can wreak havoc on you as well\".  \n\nIt might be a challenge but it's very possible to survive, says Mr MacDonald, who recalled two cases in recent years. \n\nOn Monday, Manitoba RCMP found an 84-year-old grandmother who had been missing for four days in the wilderness after being separated from friends while picking blueberries. She only had minor injuries. \n\nIn 2017, two young German tourists walked over 100 km in 11 days in northern Manitoba after their canoe was damaged. They were relatively unscathed when they finally reached the highway leading to Gillam. \n\nPolice initially considered Mr McLeod and Mr Schmegelsky missing, but on 23 July police named them as suspects in the deaths of Chynna Deese, a 24-year-old American, and her Australian boyfriend, Lucas Fowler, 23. No charges have yet been laid in that case.\n\nThe couple were on a road trip in Canada and are believed to have been shot and killed in mid-July. \n\nPolice have charged Mr Schmegelsky and Mr McLeod with second-degree murder in the death of Leonard Dyck, 64. His body was found on 19 July. \n\nThe two are considered\"armed and dangerous\"and the public have been warned not to approach them.\n\nLittle is known about equipment they may have with them or of their experience in the wilderness. \n\nSherman Kong, founder and chief instructor of Maple Leaf Survival, told the BBC that the two have the added burden of being on the run. \n\nThey may avoid using any firearms in their possession to hunt or to scare off wildlife for fear of being spotted, might be wary of lighting fires, and skip the shelter of cabins to avoid detection. \n\nPeople who find themselves lost in the woods are often advised to stay in one location, which makes it easier for search teams to find them. \n\nBut both Mr McLeod and Mr Schmegelsky could be on the move over rough terrain, meaning they would likely be tired and hungry.  \n\nMr Kong says their mental state will be as much of a factor as their outdoor experience.\n\n\"You can have all of the gear and all of the training and none of that means anything if in a real-life situation you panic, you lose the ability to think and it all goes out the window,\"he says. \n\nDespite the best efforts of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, searching along with military air support, it will be difficult to find the two - if they are still in the area. \n\nPolice say it's possible the suspects inadvertently received assistance and are no longer in the Gillam region. \n\n\"It's a needle in a haystack in that area.

For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009.\n\nBernard Aw, market strategist with trading firm IG, said given the tepid demand, it was hard to fathom why oil producers were pumping out more crude. \n\nOpec producers, notably Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were producing more oil than necessary, while US stockpiles were nearly 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. \n\n\"At this rate, the fundamentals of oil are going to get worse before it gets better as the supply glut widens. This means we are likely to see more weakness in oil futures in the coming sessions,\"Mr Aw said. \n\nOil dealers are also anticipating revised US economic growth data for the second quarter, to be released on Thursday. \n\nThe figures could be key to the Federal Reserve's thoughts on when to raise interest rates. \n\nAn eventual interest rate rise is expected to strengthen the US dollar, which in turn would make dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, once again affecting demand.\nTL;DR: Oil prices have slumped to six-year lows as global stock markets continue to fall on concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.\n\nArticle: By Martina  PurdyBBC NI Political Correspondent\n\nAn independent panel has recommended a new funding policy and cash incentives to encourage smaller schools to merge. \n\nMr O'Dowd appointed the review panel, headed by Sir Robert Salisbury, last June. \n\nThe panel examined the Common Funding Schemes and found that it was outdated, too complicated and failing pupils.\n\nSimpler formula \n\nThe gap between the best and worst performing schools was wider than other parts of the UK. \n\nThe panel has recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby. \n\nThe panel is also recommending increasing significantly the amount of money going to pupils from socially disadvantaged background, including children in foster care. \n\nSir Robert Salisbury said he found the current scheme was serving the needs of the institutions - keeping open relatively expensive schools. \n\nThe review found that on average the cost of educating a child in a small primary school could be three times higher than a larger school.\nTL;DR: Education Minister John O'Dowd has been told that he is spending too much on keeping small schools open and not enough on disadvantaged pupils.\n\nArticle: Terryann Samuels had been renting a home in West Bromwich but sought council property in neighbouring Birmingham due to a shortfall between her rent and housing benefit.\n\nThe city's council said she should have made do using other welfare payments.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected that view. \n\nJustices found the mother-of-four should not have had to use her non-housing benefits to cover rent because her other living expenses, including meeting her children's needs, were\"reasonable\".\n\nThe case centred on events from 2011 following the termination of Ms Samuels' private tenancy in West Bromwich where rent was \u00a335 more than her housing benefit.\n\nShe made a homelessness application to Birmingham City Council, but the authority effectively told her arrears could have been avoided and she had the\"flexibility\"in her budget to cover her \u00a3700 rent.\n\nFailure to be flexible, it said, amounted to her being intentionally homeless and therefore ineligible for council housing.\n\nQuashing that decision, Lord Carnwath, who gave Wednesday's lead ruling, said:\"I find it hard to see on what basis the finding of intentional homelessness could be properly upheld.\"\n\nHe said he hoped the council would now\"accept full responsibility\"for Ms Samuels and her family, who have been in temporary accommodation.\n\nThe Child Poverty Action Group charity said\"no mother should have to see her children go short of essentials in order to pay rent\".\n\nCalling the ruling an important judgement for the future of the welfare system, Shelter added:\"We're very pleased to see the court recognise that it's not lawful to expect families to rely on money they need for their basic living expenses to pay their rent when their housing benefit can't cover it.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.\nTL;DR: A woman who spent benefits on feeding her children rather than paying rent has a won a court case against a council that declared her intentionally homeless after she fell into arrears.\n\nArticle: MPs voted by 319 to 308 to remove an amendment to the Trade Bill which would have forced ministers to withdraw from deals with nations the UK High Court ruled guilty of mass killings.\n\nIt comes amid condemnation of China's treatment of the Uighur people. \n\nThe rebels believe they have enough support to secure another vote soon.\n\nAmong those to defy the government were ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet ministers David Davis and Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. \n\nInternational courts\n\nThe rebellion is one of the largest on an issue not related to the Covid-19 pandemic during Boris Johnson's time as prime minister. \n\nThe government has a Commons majority of 80 but this was whittled down to just 11 as prominent ex-ministers such as Tobias Ellwood, Caroline Nokes and Nusrat Ghani, as well as a number of MPs first elected last year, sided with the opposition.\n\nMPs have been debating proposals, tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Alton, to give British courts the right to decide if a country is committing genocide, a decision currently left to the jurisdiction of international courts.  \n\nThe proposals, also backed by Labour, would mean that ministers would have to revoke post-Brexit trade deals with countries that were ruled to be carrying out systematic mass killings. \n\nThe issue is expected to resurface when the Trade Bill returns to the House of Lords.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Conservative rebels, led by former leader Iain Duncan Smith, were unable to force a vote on a separate amendment they had proposed.\n\nEvery speaker in today's debate - from the front and back benches - said genocide was abhorrent. The worst of crimes. There was united criticism of China's brutal treatment of the Uighurs too. \n\nBut the question Parliament has been wrestling with is whether the High Court should have the right to decide if a country is committing genocide. And if they did judge a country has been carrying out mass killings, should the High Court be able to compel the government to revoke any trade treaty it has with that country? \n\nMinisters insist it should be the job of elected governments, not judges, to determine trade policy. But opposition parties and a large cohort of Tory backbenchers argue it's essential the High Court can rule on genocide and ensure the UK's new trade-making freedom has an obligation to uphold human rights too. \n\nThis also is an argument about where power lies after Brexit and what role Parliament should have in shaping trade policy after decades in the EU.\n\nBut BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said that by securing large, but not overwhelming, support for Lord Alton's amendment in the Commons, the rebels hope the government will accept Mr Duncan Smith's own amendment - which would give the Commons the right to debate whether trade deals can be halted if genocide is proven. \n\nThe debate came as the US government formally declared that China was committing genocide in its repression of Uighur muslims in Xinjiang.\n\n'Light of hope'\n\nThe UK government has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and last week announced measures to cut UK business links with forced labour camps in the region. \n\nBut some MPs suspect the government is pulling its punches to avoid antagonising Beijing. \n\nMr Duncan Smith said the debate was\"all about simply shining a light of hope to all those out there who have failed to get their day in court and failed to be treated properly\".\n\n\"If this country doesn't stand up for that then I want to know what would it ever stand up for again?,\"he added. \n\nBut Trade Minister Greg Hands said it was unprecedented and unacceptable to give the courts powers to revoke trade deals agreed by elected governments. \n\nAnd he argued that no one would benefit from the proposal because the UK currently had no free trade deal with China.\nTL;DR: The government has narrowly seen off a rebellion by 33 Tory MPs, who want to outlaw trade deals with countries judged to be committing genocide.\n\nArticle: The conflict ended almost two years ago. \n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) says more than twenty people, including some Tamil Tiger fighters, have\"disappeared\", after reports\n                  that they had been captured by government forces. \n               \n\n\nUnresolved enforced disappearances should be part of the mandate of a proposed UN  investigation into laws-of-war violations\n                  by both government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), it said.\n               \n\n\u201cThe Sri Lankan government needs to respond to all allegations of disappearances with more than a ritual blanket denial,\u201d\n                  said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \n               \n\n\n\n\nIt says that some of the disappeared Tamil Tiger members have surrendered to the army together with the Rev.

The review of the designs and final licensing could take several years. \n\nThe last new reactor design to be agreed was in December last year for energy firms EDF and Areva, for sites at Hinkley Point, Somerset, and Sizewell at Suffolk.\n\nThe process to approve those designs took five years, costing an estimated \u00a335m.\n\n'Key early step'\n\nThe new deal signed off by the ONR and Horizon-Hitachi ensures that the nuclear developers will foot the entire bill for putting the new ABWR designs under the microscope.\n\nBut the bill for assessing the reactor designs is seen as a tiny proportion of what could be an \u00a38bn project for Anglesey.\n\nHorizon's chief operating officer, Alan Raymant said:\"Now that the assessment agreements are in place, Hitachi-GE will be able to begin a meaningful preparatory process for their first major submissions to the regulator later this year.\"\n\n\"GDA is a long term and rigorous process, which will ultimately determine whether the regulators will consider the ABWR suitable for construction in the UK.\"\n\nKen Sato, the general manager for licensing at Hitachi Europe, added:\"We are very pleased to have made such swift progress over the recent months.\n\n\"This is a key early step and we look forward to the development of between four and six ABWR reactors in the UK.\"\nTL;DR: Nuclear regulators have signed an agreement

published into an outbreak of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) at Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, this year.\n\nIt was one of a series of problems which resulted in the resignation of three senior Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) figures.\n\nThe new head of nursing said the board has\"acted quickly\"to make changes.\n\nBetween January and May this year there were 96 cases of C. diff infection at Glan Clwyd hospital.\n\nAt least seven patients who died were found to be carrying the bug.\n\nThe outbreak followed a period in which C. diff infection rates within the Betsi Cadwaladr board area were higher than in most other parts of Wales.\n\nBCUHB runs NHS services in the six counties of north Wales with a budget of around \u00a31.2bn.\n\nIn June three senior figures resigned after a damning report on its\"significant management failings\".\n\nThe chairman, chief executive and vice-chairman stepped down after health and audit watchdogs found a range of problems, including infection control.\n\n'Everyone's responsibility'\n\nAn initial report prepared by Public Health Wales had highlighted that the systems to monitor and manage infection control issues within the health board were not operating\"consistently and effectively\".\n\nAs a result the health board asked Professor Brian Duerden, emeritus professor of medical microbiology at Cardiff University, to conduct an independent expert review of infection controls, and to recommend improvements.\n\nHis report published on Tuesday said more needed to be done to improve infection prevention and control\"especially in terms of leadership and management\".\n\nProf Duerden looked at all aspects of the way infection control issues were handled at the hospital from individual job responsibilities to the management hierarchy.\n\n\"It is well recognised that when there are weaknesses in a system, infections is one of the first challenges that will expose those weaknesses,\"the report said.\n\n\"The phrase'infection prevention and control is everyone's responsibility' means exactly what it says,\"it added.\n\n'Zero-tolerance'\n\nThe health board said it has already acted on recommendations.\n\n\"First we must apologise to the people of North Wales that our infection control practices have not been as good as they should have been,\"said Angela Hopkins, recently appointed executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services.\n\n\"We have made it clear that we have an attitude of'zero-tolerance' to preventable infection across the organisation,\"she added.\n\n\"As an immediate step I have brought in a leading expert in infection prevention to work with us in north Wales as we improve our wider infection control services.\n\n\"We have also put in place a weekly monitoring system at board level and we now have infection control groups led by senior clinical staff in each acute hospital to make sure there are clear lines of reporting and accountability at a local level.  \n\n\"We are also in the process of recruiting additional nurses to our infection control teams.\"\n\nMrs Hopkins said she hoped that by commissioning and publishing the report, and acting on its findings, BCUHB will be able to\"demonstrate and assure patients of the health board's determination to make the necessary and urgent improvements\".\n\nDarren Millar AM, the Conservatives' shadow minister for health, said it was\"unforgiveable that senior managers took their eyes off the ball and allowed standards to drop\".\n\n\"This report must be swiftly digested

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) minister Edwin Poots openly questions church closures, arguing if off-licences can be trusted to stay open, churches should be trusted too.\n\n12 May 2020 - In one of the first steps taken to ease the first lockdown, places of worship in Northern Ireland are told they can reopen for individual prayer and hold outdoor drive-through services.\n\n29 June 2020 - The public are permitted to attend indoor religious services for the first time in three months, in a move hailed as an important day for people of faith in Northern Ireland.\n\n19 November 2020 - Rising infections lead to the announcement of a two-week circuit breaker, which initially includes church closures with the exception of weddings, civil partnerships and funerals.\n\n24 November 2020 - After being lobbied by church leaders, Stormont ministers clarify the rules and confirm that places of worship can remain open for individual prayer during the circuit breaker. \n\nPresbyterian cleric, the Reverend Cheryl Meban, said she does not believe there will be a row over the issue as churches and politicians share a responsibility to keep the public safe.\n\nSpeaking a day before the meeting, she said churches should make their own decisions independently and close voluntarily, rather than waiting to be told to shut.\n\n\"We don't want to shut down, but it's the right thing to do and we do it for the well-being of others,\"she said.\n\nThe Reverend Chris Hudson, Moderator of the Non-Subscribing Church of Ireland, said he would take decisions based on the advice of health officials.\n\n\"I would prefer to depend on those who know better than me, with regard to the medical advice and the science, and for them to instruct me or tell me it's important to close the church,\"he said.\n\n\"I don't have that knowledge that they have and throughout this pandemic I have respected the science, the medical advice and the information coming from particularly the Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride.\n\n\"Absolutely we would close the church if that's his belief, which it possibly will be.\"\n\nVulnerable and isolated\n\nMr Hudson expressed concern for vulnerable parishioners, including some asylum seekers, for whom a church service is\"the only social contact they have during the week\".\n\n\"We would have to, with respect to the authorities, to find some other way that we could continue giving them pastoral care even when the church is closed.\"\n\nMs Meban, who is a chaplain at Ulster University, agreed public church services were very important to many people who need contact in their lives.\n\nBut she added:\"I think we are getting to a point where it's actually important for us as churches to say we're going to find creative other ways to look after the vulnerable; to reach out and care for the isolated. \n\n\"We can't put them at risk and we need to stand with the rest of the community.\"\nTL;DR: Northern Ireland's main church denominations are to cease public worship until early February.\n\nArticle: It has accepted the advice of a new review looking at harm reported by women who received the treatment for stress urinary incontinence.\n\nThe review's chair, Baroness Julia Cumberlege, said she was\"appalled at the seriousness and scale of the tragic stories\"that her team had heard. \n\nMany women say the implants caused them agony by cutting into tissue.\n\nSome say they have been left with life-changing injuries.\n\nClaire Cooper, who had the implants, mistakenly had a hysterectomy after doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing her pain.

You can go from one side of the sky to the other side of the sky - rather than in minutes, you can do it milliseconds.  And because it's digital, Lofar can look in multiple directions at once,\"he told BBC News.\n\nLofar is sensitive to much longer wavelength radiation than the UK's established radio telescope array called Merlin, which is based on the giant Lovell dish at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire.  \n\nBeing able to detect this particular segment (1-10m/240-30MHz) of the electromagnetic spectrum will enable scientists to study very different astrophysical phenomena.\n\nOne key target is the epoch of re-ionisation.  \n\nThis relates to an important change in the cosmic environment brought about by the very first population of stars to shine in the Universe.\n\nTheory holds these hot, young giants produced intense ultraviolet radiation that\"fried\"the neutral gas that had formed up to that point and which we detect in the local Universe today as a diffuse plasma between the galaxies.\n\nSeeing this first population of stars is just beyond the capability of the current crop of optical telescopes like Hubble or the VLT, but conditions during this epoch could be probed at Lofar frequencies, astronomers say.\n\nThe network plans to install more and more antennas over the years to make Lofar ever more sensitive to what it is trying to see.\n\nDerek McKay-Bukowski said:\"When the entire project is finished, we will have something in the order of 5,000 antennas for both low-band and high-band, which will be located at about 48 stations across Europe.  \n\n\"The biggest separation is about 1,100km.  Distance between stations gives you resolution; to see finer detail you need bigger and bigger separations.\"\n\nLofar is led by Astron (the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy) which is installing a dense network of antennas centred near the village Exloo in the north of Halland.\n\nLofar UK is funded through a collaboration of UK universities with the SEPnet consortium and the UK Science and Technologies Facilities Council.\n\nAs well as re-ionisation, the project has five other major research areas:\n\n1. Surveying space beyond our galaxy to try to understand the history of star formation and black hole growth over cosmological time\n\n2.

At Marr College, a secondary school in Troon, three of the eight English teachers are currently off.\n\nIt has proved impossible for South Ayrshire Council to get adequate supply cover. So first, second and third year students are not getting as many English lessons from an English teacher as they should be. \n\nInstead other teachers - such as modern language teachers - are looking after some English classes as a temporary solution. \n\nEnglish teachers\n\nThe council hopes to recruit three full-time English teachers - who'll initially be used to cover the gaps at Marr College - within the next few weeks.\n\nMost supply teachers are called in to cover for a few days when a regular teacher falls sick or goes on a training course. \n\nProtracted problems quite as severe as the one at Marr College are likely to be relatively uncommon although the EIS said it has\"significant anecdotal evidence\"from members about secondary schools where children are not being taught by subject specialists.\n\nNationally the EIS believes more than a third of supply requests and are not being met and that students are losing out.\n\nGeneral secretary Larry Flanagan said:\"That means that pupils are not being taught by subject specialists or they're in extended assemblies or sometimes they're sitting in the canteen being supervised because no teacher is available.\"\n\nMr Flanagan believes a substantial cut in the rate of pay for supply teachers who are engaged for less than 5 days has had a significant impact. They get around half the daily rate given to teachers called in for longer.\n\nProblems providing cover can be most acute in rural or remote areas or with specialist subjects at secondary schools.\n\nBBC Scotland contacted all 32 Scottish councils and a number said they had noted a drop in the number of supply teachers registered with them.\n\nEdinburgh said there had been a reduction in their ranks from about 950 last August - to 775 this year. But the council says it has been actively trying to find replacements for the registered and doesn't expect problems this year.\n\nSubject specialisms\n\nStirling Council said:\"We are currently experiencing difficulty in the primary sector and also in with subject specialisms such Physics, Maths and Home Economics in secondary sector.\"\n\nPerth and Kinross Council said:\"The change in terms and conditions for supply staff has reduced the numbers that are available and we are currently trying to recruit supply staff. The availability of supply staff has further been restricted by providing cover for a higher than normal number of maternity leave.\n\n\"The main impacts are the amount of time head teachers and deputes are spending covering primary classes, and in secondary schools that subject classes may not always have a subject specialist available.\"\n\nEast Ayrshire said it had experienced some difficulties, particularly in remote rural areas and some specific subjects.\n\nWest Dunbartonshire said:\"Over the last few years we have noticed that there is less availability on our teacher supply list. As a result of this we advertised last year and also refreshed our list to ensure that it reflected people available for work. \n\n\"As with all other authorities we are experiencing difficulties in obtaining supply staff - especially within particular subjects in the secondary sector.\"\n\nAs well as pay, there are several possible reasons for the drop in the number of supply teachers - one of them the unfortunate by-product of what most would see as a positive development.\n\nMore newly-qualified teachers are now securing permanent positions so cannot do supply work. In the past, more may have joined the supply register because they could not get a full-time teaching job.\n\n'Impact of pay agreement'\n\nAnother reason may be changes to the curriculum. Some supply teachers may have dropped out because of these. And, of course, some supply teachers have simply retired.\n\nBut what might help solve the problem?\n\nMany councils are actively trying to recruit more supply teachers while improvements to workforce planning could help sort out gaps caused by planned absences such as maternity leave.\n\nNeighbouring councils might also be able to work more effectively to co-ordinate their banks of supply teachers.\n\nEducation Secretary Michael Russell said:\"The Scottish Government has tackled teacher unemployment by cutting student teacher numbers, leading to an improving picture across the country.\n\n\"However, we recognise that there are challenges in relation to supply teachers, including the impact of the last pay agreement negotiated through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT).\n\n\"We continue to involve teaching unions and other stakeholders in workforce planning discussions with a view to ensuring that we have the right number of teachers for our schools the length and breadth of Scotland.\n\n\"I am on record as having said that the SNCT needs to look at the supply situation again, and I understand that, while negotiations are on-going, there is a new pay agreement on the table which will address this specific issue.\"\n\nThe current pay offer from Cosla means supply teachers would start to be paid at a higher rate after three days instead of five.\n\nIn the meantime practical problems caused by specific shortages - such as those at Marr College - continue.\nTL;DR: There are fewer supply teachers across Scotland to fill gaps in the classroom rota caused by sickness, training courses and other absences.\n\nArticle: Six-year-old Rikki Neave's naked body was found in woods near Peterborough's Welland Estate in November 1994. \n\nHe had been strangled and his mother Ruth, who was initially accused of his murder, has now claimed police pursued her as an\"easy target\".\n\nShe later admitted child neglect and cruelty and was jailed for seven years.\n\nA national newspaper branded her Britain's most evil mother but she has insisted she had never hurt a child.\n\nMrs Neave, now 45, accepts the perception of her guilt still lingers.\n\nAt a press conference at the Oliver Cromwell Hotel in March, Cambridgeshire, she appealed for new information to catch her son's killer.\n\nShe also said Cambridgeshire Police had wrongly charged her with murder.\n\nMrs Neave said she now had evidence Rikki was killed by a sex abuse gang and this had been handed to Cambridgeshire Police.\n\nBut her daughter Rochelle, 23, believes her mother should now drop the case.\n\n\"Although I was only young, I can still remember the abuse,\"she said.\n\n\"There was never any food in the house.

Her abusive partner used non-fatal strangulation as a means of control throughout the five years they were together. \n\n\"It was like his favourite thing to do,\"says Jenny, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. \n\n\"That sounds really awful and trivial but that is how it becomes as an abuse victim. You learn to accept that is part of your life. It was like something I had to manage.\"\n\n\"We would wake up in the morning and he would be in one of those moods, and I would see it in his eyes and I would think today's the day I'm going to get it.\n\n\"It could be something as simple as:'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation.\"\n\nEventually one night she did call the police during an attack.\n\n\"He chased me round the house and every time he caught me he would pin me to the floor and strangle me until I had marks. \n\n\"I had burst blood vessels. I was streaming with tears. I just kept thinking:'This is how I am going to die.' \n\n\"The doors were locked. He'd smashed my phone. I managed to get to the window and shout and one of the neighbours called the police.\"\n\nHowever, she was dismayed by the police response.\"I thought it was quite lax. They didn't take the strangulation as seriously as they should have.\" \n\nSuspended sentence\n\nHer partner was charged with common assault. He pleaded guilty and was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months. \n\n\"Strangulation needs to be a specific offence. I think the weak police response contributed to keeping me in the relationship,\"she says. \n\nJenny believed her partner would eventually kill her.\n\n\"I just kept looking in the mirror and thinking: you need to leave and you're the only person who can do it. \n\n\"So one day while he was asleep, I picked up whatever I could carry and I ran and got on a train.\"\n\nCross-party support\n\nPoliticians and campaigners tried and failed to have a new offence of non-fatal strangulation introduced in the Domestic Abuse Bill when it was going through the House of Commons. \n\nDuring Tuesday's debate on the bill in the Lords, the Conservative peer and former victims' commissioner, Baroness Newlove, said she intended to table an amendment to the bill when it reached the committee stage.\n\nShe said non-fatal strangulation was currently not being picked up adequately by the police, as it often left no physical marks on the victim.\n\nShe described it as a terrifying crime, with many victims testifying they felt as though their heads were going to explode and they were about to die.\n\nPeers from other parties also spoke in support of a new offence.  \n\n'A gendered crime' \n\nNogah Offer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence, says:\"We believe this is a real opportunity to make a difference.\"\n\nCommon assault is a summary offence that can be charged by the police.\n\nBut when it involves domestic abuse, it should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, its guidance says.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Justice said:\"Non-fatal strangulation is a serious crime which is already covered by existing laws such as common assault and attempted murder.\"\n\nA spokesperson said the government would keep this area of the law under review, but said a specific offence of attempting to choke, strangle or suffocate a person is included in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and, according to the 2015 Serious Crime Act, attempted strangulation can fall under the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour. \n\nDr Catherine White, clinical director of St. Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, says:\"Strangulation often ends up being treated the same as a slap or a punch. \n\n\"It's a very different crime. Often there is no external injury to the neck, which is why it's a very powerful tool for the perpetrator.  \n\n\"It can cause confusion but ultimately it can lead to death.\" \n\nA research project led by Dr White describes non-fatal strangulation as a\"gendered crime, with nearly all the patients female and the alleged perpetrators male\".\n\nAnd figures from the Femicide Census, which looked at the cases of women killed by men in the UK, found that in 2018, 29% died through strangulation. \n\nCampaigners point to New Zealand and some parts of the United States and Australia, where non-fatal strangulation has become a specific offence. \n\nMeanwhile, after help from a women's centre  and counselling, Jenny now feels stronger and happier. \n\nDespite the pandemic, she says, having finally escaped her abuser:\"2020 was one of the best years of my life.\"\nTL;DR: A fresh move is under way to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence in England and Wales, after the House of Lords debated the Domestic Abuse Bill.\n\nArticle: Developers wanted to build the 100m high turbines near Romanno Bridge in Peebleshire. \n\nStevenson Hill Wind Energy, on behalf of West Coast Energy, also applied to construct a new access road from the A701. \n\nThe application drew 125 letters of objection and one of support. \n\nThey wanted to build the turbines along the ridges of the peaks of Green Knows, Hag Law and Wether Law. \n\nMembers of the Scottish Borders Council's planning applications committee raised concerns about its visual impact on the landscape and neighbouring communities. \n\nArchaeologists had also claimed it would cause unacceptable harm to four scheduled monuments of national importance and a historic landscape of\"at least regional importance\". \n\nPlanning officials advised councillors to reject the scheme on landscape impact and potential noise nuisance grounds.\nTL;DR: Councillors have unanimously voted to refuse permission for an eight turbine wind farm in the Scottish Borders.\n\nArticle: The government unveiled a three-tier system of restrictions for England on Monday to try to stop Covid spreading.\n\nLondon is in Tier One, the lowest level, and will be subject to national rules including the rule of six and the 22:00 curfew on hospitality venues.\n\n\"Londoners should understand that this could change very quickly - potentially even this week,\"the mayor said.\n\nMr Khan said he speaks to council leaders and Public Health England on a daily basis to analyse the data and confirmed the capital has seen 8,000 new cases of Covid. \n\n\"We are seeing hospital admission rate increase because of Covid-19,\"he told the BBC.\"I am also worried about non-coronavirus patients who need medical assistance, but who may not get treatment because the NHS is overwhelmed.\"\n\nIt comes after it emerged experts advised the government on 21 September that an immediate\"circuit breaker\"was the best way to control cases, at a meeting on 21 September.\n\nMr Khan backed the concept for use in London\"for two or three weeks\"as half-term approaches.\n\nHe said:\"I think for a short period of time having additional restrictions to stop the virus spreading and dealing with it is far more effective in the medium-to-long term.\n\n\"If we are not careful we could be sleepwalking into three, four or five months of really strict restrictions which could be avoided with this circuit breaker.\"\n\nThe leader of Southwark Council also backed calls for a short, sharp lockdown to be implemented this month.\n\nLabour's Kieron Williams said:\"With positive cases rising at worrying speed in Southwark and across London, I'm calling on the government to urgently implement a circuit breaker.\n\n\"It's imperative that we follow scientific advice without delay, or we will be risking people's health. \n\n\"There is no way to dress up the facts here - we are at a critical point and without immediate action, people in Southwark will needlessly die.\n\n\"I know what a worrying time this is for our residents and businesses, but a short period of tighter restrictions could be less painful to the local economy and to families than something which essentially draws the process out for longer and risks future lockdown over Christmas as cases continue to rise.\"\n\nWhat are the restrictions?\n\nAreas with the lowest rates of infection are in Tier One.

There are also plans for rules and protection to make international investment more attractive.\n\nThe two sides say an agreement would ultimately lead to higher incomes and employment, claims that are hotly disputed by critics.\n\nThere are also concerns about regulation - critics say a deal could lead to lower standards of protection for consumers, workers and the environment, and job losses. \n\nCampaigners also object to plans for tribunals which international investors could use to challenge some actions by governments involved in the agreement. \n\nIn the UK, there has been a particular concern that TTIP might lead to the irreversible privatisation of some health services, although following the UK referendum, that issue is now probably not about TTIP but about any agreement that the British government might negotiate directly with the US.    \n\nThe UK referendum result does complicate the talks. The UK is the largest US export market within the EU - and its fifth biggest in the world. How will that affect the US view on the negotiations? \n\nUK governments tend to be among the most enthusiastic supporters of trade liberalisation agreements. But then some analysts say it might help if the UK is no longer pushing for the inclusion of financial services against US reluctance. It is not so important for other EU countries. \n\nReservations\n\nThere are elections in the next year that are every bit as significant for the talks. France Germany and the US all have key votes. \n\nIn the US Donald Trump's attacks on past American trade deals are well known.  But trade could also be an important campaign issue in the European polls and make some political leaders less keen on TTIP. Already the French President Francois Hollande and the leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party Sigmar Gabriel have expressed reservations.\n\nAnd there are still areas of the talks that the negotiators themselves are finding heavy going. \n\nThey have made progress on offers to cut or eliminate tariffs but not on all goods. They are struggling to agree on access to government contracts and on what are called geographical indications: is feta just a type of cheese or does it have to be made in Greece? \n\nThese and other unresolved issues could be settled with the political will to do it. But it is politics, especially the disquiet of many voters about the impact of trade liberalisation that could delay TTIP or conceivably eventually sink it entirely.\nTL;DR: The European Union and the United States have the outline of a trade agreement, according to a senior EU official.\n\nArticle: By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe departure of Dame Lowell Goddard has plunged the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) into crisis.  \n\nAnd what makes that so bitterly ironic is that she was precisely the person appointed to be the steadying hand on an inquiry that many felt had lost its way before it had even started.   \n\nThe first chairwoman, Baroness Butler-Sloss, a hugely experienced retired judge, stood down after a week because of concerns relating to the fact she was the sister of the late Lord Havers. He was attorney general at the time of some of the abuse that was to be examined.  \n\nWhy that had not been considered, or thought to be important, before her appointment remains a mystery.\n\nThe second, City solicitor Dame Fiona Woolf, lasted less than two months. Her judicial experience was confined to sitting as a part-time magistrate.  \n\nShe resigned after it was claimed she was too close to Lord Brittan, who was at the time under investigation for sexual offences. \n\nHe was subsequently exonerated, but like Lady Butler-Sloss, Dame Fiona was seen as just too close to the British establishment that would fall under the inquiry's gaze. \n\nEstablished in 2014, the IICSA is not simply a public inquiry, it is a vast, six-decade retrospective exercise in national soul-searching.  \n\nThere is little doubt that children were sexually abused in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s and beyond, across many public and private institutions. \n\nSociety frequently tolerated such abuse by turning a blind eye and allowing those who were complicit to go freely about their gruesome business. \n\nIt took a series of scandals, most notably that of serial child abuser Jimmy Savile, to really change perceptions. \n\nThe IICSA must delve into the national psyche and institutions of decades past, and carry out extensive examinations of how they operated in relation to children. \n\nIts scope is mammoth. \n\nChurches, children's homes, the police, armed forces, schools, hospitals, charities, the BBC, and the role of well known people in politics and the media are just some of the areas it aims to tackle. \n\nIt must then come up with a comprehensive report that ensures no such abuse can occur in future.  \n\nThat such an inquiry could have lost three chairwomen, all appointed by the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, in two years is disturbing.  \n\nSo, back to basics.\n\nThere are two key selection criteria for the new chairman or chairwoman. \n\nThey need the intellect and experience to do the job.\n\n It would normally be a senior serving, or former, judge familiar with the law underpinning a public inquiry, and used to hearing and analysing mammoth amounts of testimony from multiple witnesses - effectively and with sensitivity. \n\nBut two senior judges have come and gone. \n\nEqually important is perception and independence. \n\nVictims and survivors must have confidence the chairman or chairwoman is divorced from the contentious subject matter of the inquiry and key people who may figure in it.  \n\nThat is difficult for a senior British judge, who would be seen as part of the establishment and could have connections to individuals and institutions being examined. \n\nBut recruiting from abroad has also failed. \n\nWhat makes recruitment harder still is that, in football parlance, Dame Lowell had\"lost the dressing room\". \n\nMy colleague Tom Symonds has reported that there was tension, even conflict, between her and her officials.  \n\nThe former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald says chairing the inquiry is now\"not so much a poisoned chalice as a lethal injection\".\n\nThat raises two questions:\n\nThe role would dominate and define the career of a senior person and place them under an intense media spotlight for the best part of a decade or longer.  \n\nSenior judges, such as the much respected Dame Heather Hallet, who won praise for her sensitive handling of the inquests into the deaths of those killed by the 7 July 2005 London bombings, would have to give up their judicial career and the chance of becoming Lord Chief Justice. The role becomes vacant next year.\n\nAmong other names mentioned are the current counsel to the inquiry Ben Emerson QC. He is a distinguished human rights lawyer, with the advantage of knowing the preliminary work of the inquiry well.  \n\nThe barrister Michael Mansfield QC is favoured by some survivors, but at 74 is perhaps too old for a 10-year stint. \n\nBeyond judges and lawyers, Prof Alexis Jay, who led the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham and is currently on the IICSE's advisory panel, is being touted by some as an interim chairman who could then take over full time.\n\nJudge, civil servant, academic? Only the brave need apply.\nTL;DR: Wanted: highly respected chairman or chairwoman, available for up to 10 years, robust in the face of press scrutiny, and with no ties to the British establishment - it is becoming the most toxic job description in public life. Finding the right person to chair this vast, complex and crucial public inquiry is proving all but impossible.\n\nArticle: The forum in Nevada is the first major test for the former New York City mayor after a late entry to the race. \n\nThe tycoon is under fierce attack over everything from his wealth and health to past remarks on race and gender. \n\nThe eventual Democratic nominee will face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in November's election.\n\nAlso on stage in Wednesday night's debate in Las Vegas will be Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, former US Vice-President Joe Biden, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC poll on Wednesday showed Mr Sanders at 32% with Mr Biden falling to 16%. Mr Bloomberg was third on 14% and Ms Warren fourth on 12%.\n\nThe attacks from Mr Bloomberg's Democratic rivals suggest it will be a tough night for the world's ninth richest man. \n\nSanders v Bloomberg \n\nMr Sanders took a direct swipe at the billionaire on Tuesday night, railing against Mr Bloomberg and\"a system that allows billionaires to buy elections\". \n\n\"My friends, that is called oligarchy, not democracy,\"Mr Sanders said.\n\nMr Bloomberg hit back at the self-described democratic socialist, comparing Mr Sanders' tactics to President Trump's. \n\nHis campaign has also begun to raise alarm that Mr Sanders will soon accumulate an unbeatable lead in delegates - required to win the Democratic nomination - if the field remains split by Mr Bloomberg's fellow moderates, Mr Biden, Mr Buttigieg and Ms Klobuchar. \n\nThe two campaigns have also sparred over their respective candidate's health records.\n\nDefending Mr Sanders' decision not to release additional medical records after his heart attack in October, Sanders press secretary Briahna Joy Gray claimed that Mr Bloomberg had suffered heart attacks. \n\nThe businessman's campaign manager called the statement from Mr Sanders' team an\"absolute lie\". Ms Gray later said on Twitter that she\"misspoke\". \n\nIf either Mr Bloomberg or Mr Sanders - both 78 - were to win the presidency, he would become the oldest ever occupant of the White House. \n\nBiden v Bloomberg \n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Biden attacked Mr Bloomberg's campaign ads touting his relationship with former President Barack Obama and his past party affiliation. \n\n\"The truth is he's basically been a Republican his whole life,\"said Mr Biden, who was Mr Obama's vice-president.\"The fact of the matter is he didn't endorse Barack or me when we ran. This is a guy... using Barack's pictures like, you know, they're good buddies.\"\n\nMr Biden's suggestion that Mr Bloomberg's relationship with Mr Obama was more tenuous than the ads suggest has been echoed by others in the Obama administration. \n\n\"It's jarring to see all these Bloomberg ads that suggest Obama has endorsed him, especially considering how... perfunctory his endorsement of Obama was back in 2012,\"said former Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor on Twitter.\n\nTrump v Bloomberg\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump renewed his attacks on his fellow septuagenarian New York billionaire.\n\n\"Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is,\"Mr Trump tweeted.\n\nMr Bloomberg tweeted back:\"Impeached president says what?\"\n\nAfter Mr Bloomberg launched his run for president last November, the news service that bears his name said it would not investigate the billionaire or any of his Democratic rivals.\n\nMr Bloomberg is not competing in the first four Democratic leadership ballots this year, instead banking on a strong showing in the so-called Super Tuesday contest on 3 March, when 14 states will vote. \n\nHe has so far made up for his belated entry with a spending blitz, pouring more than $400m (\u00a3310m) already on national ads. \n\nWho will take on Trump in 2020?\nTL;DR: Rising White House hopeful Michael Bloomberg has been

battlefield.\n\nThe agency said the existing A9 already runs through the Killiecrankie Battlefield and any widening will have\"some impact\"on the site.\n\nEighty miles of the A9 is to be upgraded to dual carriageway in a massive project due to be completed by 2025. \n\nIt includes some 14 miles of road between Killiecrankie and Glen Garry.\n\nThe local public inquiry, which will be streamed on a web feed, begins later in Pitlochry.\n\nDr Arran Johnston, of the Scottish Battlefields Trust, said the proposed route would be\"compounding the damage\"done by the existing A9.\n\nHe said:\"Our great concern is that the significance of the battlefield wasn't given adequate weight when the decisions were being made as to how this route would be put together.\n\n\"That means some of the areas where the most intense fighting took place right along the length of the Williamite battle line will be obliterated.\"\n\nThe battle took place on 27 July 1689 between a Jacobite army under the command of John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount of Dundee,'Bonnie Dundee', and a government army commanded by General Hugh Mackay.\n\nBoth armies were attempting to reach Blair Atholl to use it as a base for future operations.\n\nThe Jacobites are thought to have lost 800 men, with around 2,000 casualties among the government troops.\n\nArtefacts from the battle were discovered during a survey of the A9 dualling in 2016.\n\nLocal campaigner James Bax said the dualling would put the new carriageway on top of where the actual fighting took place.\n\nHe said:\"In doing that, we feel it degrades the current site unnecessarily.\n\n\"We do think there are ways to mitigate the current plans to make it easier for future generations to enjoy the battlefield.\"\n\nA Transport Scotland spokesperson said:\"We are aware of the sensitivities around what is an important battlefield, and site of historical and cultural significance.\"\n\nThe agency said it has been\"engaging extensively\"with the local community and key stakeholders since 2012. \n\nIt said a number of design refinements to\"reduce land take\"on the battlefield site have been made following feedback from Historic Environment Scotland and the local community. \n\nThe spokesperson said:\"Ultimately, following detailed consideration of all objections made but not withdrawn, the Reporter will provide recommendations to the Scottish Ministers for their determination.\"\nTL;DR: Opponents of plans to upgrade the A9 at the site of a historic Highland Perthshire battle will take their concerns to a local public inquiry.\n\nArticle: The firms' respective arrangements with Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will be investigated. \n\nAnnouncing the move, tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta said that\"fair tax competition is essential\".\n\nLast year, a US Senate investigation accused Ireland of giving special tax treatment to Apple.\n\nThe European Commission will look at whether the companies' tax affairs breach EU rules on state aid.\n\nCompetition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said:\"In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n\nCountries in Europe cannot allow certain firms to pay less tax than they should, Mr Almunia added.\n\nSanctions\n\nThe investigations will focus on\"transfer pricing\", or whether the countries allowed the multinational firms to charge one part of the company over the odds for goods or services from another part of the company as a way of shifting profits.\n\nUnder Commission rules, companies must charge their subsidiaries market rates.\n\nSanctions for a breach of tax rules could include an attempt to claw money back from Apple, Starbucks and Fiat.\n\nApple said that it had not had\"any special tax deal with the Irish government\".\n\n\"We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials,\"the company said.\"Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.\"\n\nThe Irish finance ministry said Apple\"did not receive selective treatment and there was no'special tax rate deal'\".\n\n\"Ireland is confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously,\"the Department of Finance said.\n\nLast year's US Senate committee investigation revealed that Apple had been able to funnel profits into Irish subsidiaries or\"ghost companies\"that had no declared tax residency anywhere in the world, cutting billions from its tax bill.\n\nThe Senate committee hearing revealed that Apple designated its Irish entities as unlimited companies, which meant it did not have to publish annual accounts. \n\nThe Irish arrangement allowed Apple to pay just 1.9% tax on its $37bn in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact the average tax rate in the OECD countries that make up its main markets was 24% last year.\n\nIn a 40-page memorandum, the Senate committee said:\"Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple.\"\n\nStarbucks' tax row\n\nCoffee giant Starbucks has been embroiled in a tax controversy for a number of years.\n\nIn 2012, the multinational admitted that it had a special tax deal with the Dutch government which allowed it to transfer money to its Dutch sister company in royalty payments.\n\nStarbucks said on Wednesday that its Dutch tax arrangements conformed with financial law.\n\n\"We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws and OECD guidelines and we're studying the Commission's announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands,\"a Starbucks spokesperson said.\n\nThe Dutch finance ministry said it was confident that its tax system was\"robust\".\n\n\"We are confident that the investigation by the EC will in the end result in the conclusion there is no state aid involved,\"a spokesman told the BBC.\n\nFiat'compliant in Luxembourg'\n\nThe European Commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Fiat's financial firm, Fiat Finance and Trade.\n\nFiat said that while its financial arm is headquartered in Luxembourg, the investigation is into the government concerned. \n\n\"We are compliant with all Luxembourg regulations,\"the company added.\n\nLuxembourg has already riled the European Commission over the firm.\n\nThe Commission said on Wednesday that it was launching infringement proceedings against Luxembourg for giving only partial answers to requests for information about Fiat Finance and Trade tax rulings.\nTL;DR: The European Commission is to open a formal investigation into Apple, Starbucks and Fiat in relation to tax arrangements with three EU countries.\n\nArticle: Demonstrators from a Mohawk reserve blocked the tracks near Marysville on Wednesday to call attention to a spate of murders of indigenous women.\n\nAs many as 20 people were camped by the tracks, broadcaster CTV reported.\n\nAuthorities say rail service will likely resume on Thursday morning following inspection of the tracks.\n\nVIA Rail reportedly replaced scheduled trains with buses between the cities during the protest, citing\"security reasons\"for the suspension of service.\n\nSun News reported the First Nations group lit a small fire alongside a sign reading\"Justice for murdered and missing indigenous women\".\n\nEarlier this month, protesters also temporarily blocked a cargo rail line and a local highway in the same area.\n\nThe recent blockades follow a response to a parliamentary report on missing and murdered aboriginal women that did not recommend a full public inquiry into the deaths, a decision that angered First Nations activists and opposition parties in parliament.\n\nMore than 600 indigenous women have gone missing or have been found murdered in the past 20 years, according to the Native Women's Association of Canada.\n\nAnd the February killing of Loretta Saunders, an Inuk student working on a thesis about missing and murdered indigenous women, has also reignited action over the issue.\nTL;DR: Services on Canada's VIA Rail commuter line between Toronto and Ottawa are expected to resume on Thursday after a protest by First Nations members.\n\nArticle: By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent\n\nOfficers were informed of the decision on Wednesday morning. \n\nIt is believed to cover a six-week period between October and November.\n\nThe move comes as the police have issued numerous warnings about the threats Brexit poses to the force, including the risk of organised crime expanding in Northern Ireland. \n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed that Brexit will happen with or without a deal on 31 October. \n\nBut MPs passed a law before Parliament was suspended to force the PM to ask for an extension from the EU if a deal - or approval for no-deal - is voted for by MPs by 19 October.\n\nMPs are set to return to Westminster later after the Supreme Court ruled that Parliament's suspension was unlawful. \n\nA no-deal Brexit could bring unique policing challenges, as any border infrastructure would have to be protected from any potential threats. \n\nOn Wednesday, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris are meeting for the annual Cross Border Organised Crime Conference.\nTL;DR: It is understood the PSNI has imposed leave restrictions on staff as part of Brexit preparations.\n\nArticle: With 10 dead in South Korea, public confidence has faltered as authorities have failed to swiftly halt the spread of the disease. This has contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty.\n\nSouth Korean authorities have issued guidelines, advising people to\"avoid visiting crowded places as much as possible\"and to wear face masks in public. It has also advised against\"close contact with people who have fever and heavy breathing\".\n\nSome buildings have set up temperature screening booths at their receptions.\n\nIt appears that to some extent, South Koreans have been heeding the advice. People wearing masks on the streets of South Korea's cities have become a common sight.\n\nBaseball games, cinemas, churches, shopping malls and theme parks have reported lower visitor volumes, according to news agencies.\n\nSome South Koreans are choosing to get groceries delivered to them at home instead of venturing out.\n\nE-Mart and Lotte Mart, two of the country's biggest supermarket chains, saw weekly sales in store drop by 12% while online sales went up by 50%, reported AFP news agency. \n\nSupermarket staff have also been wiping down supermarket trolley handles before and after use.\n\nNearly 2,500 schools have been temporarily shut, while health workers have been spraying down subway stations and the insides of train carriages.\n\nAfter facing intense criticism that it was not doing enough, the government has stepped up efforts to put out more timely information and allay public panic.\n\nIt has launched a website dedicated to Mers updates, Acting Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan was photographed shaking hands with shop owners, and President Park Geun-hye postponed a trip to the US vowing to put a\"quick end\"to the outbreak.\n\nPolice have charged eight people for allegedly spreading rumours falsely naming hospitals treating Mers patients and disclosing patient information without consent, reported Yonhap news agency.\n\nVillage lockdown\n\nMore than 3,800 people remain under quarantine - either monitored in hospitals or at home. Those at home are being tracked by their mobile phones.\n\nBut one entire village has been put on lockdown.\n\nMore than 100 residents of Jangduk in North Jeolla province have been barred from leaving and from receiving visitors since last Friday, when one case of Mers was confirmed. \n\nThe elderly woman had earlier sought treatment at a hospital where Mers patients were being treated.\n\nWhile she is now in another nearby hospital, the whole village has been isolated, with all entry roads guarded by sentries.\n\nHealth workers have been taking residents' temperatures twice a day, and the government and other villages have been providing food and supplies.\n\n\"We are not in the middle of war, and didn't get any advance notice,\"a resident told Reuters news agency over the phone.\n\nMask fun\n\nAmid the public unease, some South Koreans have tried to make light of the situation - including this Seoul wedding party whose picture has gone viral online.\n\nWedding organiser Sewing for The Soil told the BBC's Kevin Kim in Seoul that they provided masks at the ceremony last Saturday in case guests needed them.\n\n\"After taking the main wedding photos, we thought it would be fun if we took a group photo with everybody with the masks on, and the bride and groom agreed... it was all fun and light-hearted,\"said a spokesman.\n\nActors and singers have also started posting pictures of themselves wearing masks on their social media accounts, prompting a wave of\"mask selfies\", reported The Korea Herald.\n\nSome have used it as an opportunity to encourage better health practices.\"Wash your hands, wear a mask (to) avoid Mers,\"wrote pop singer Zico.\n\nCulture curtailment\n\nBut Korean pop music or K-Pop, one of South Korea's most famous cultural exports, has itself not been immune to the slowdown, with several singers postponing their national tours.\n\nA rap music festival which was due to be held in Seoul last weekend has also been cancelled.\n\nArts and cultural centres in the cities of Busan, Jeju and Yongin have cancelled performances, reported The Korea Herald, and film distributors have postponed releases as cinema ticket sales have plummeted by 25%.\n\nAn international book fair due to open next week has also been put back to mid-October, while agricultural events, such as the Mountain Berry and Watermelon Festival in Gochang county, have been cancelled.\n\nTourism drop-off\n\nKnown for its shopping and beautiful landscapes, South Korea is a magnet for visitors in the region.\n\nBut since the outbreak began more than 54,000 tourists have cancelled their bookings, according to tourism authorities.\n\nMany of those cancelling flights are from Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore, according to travel analysis firm ForwardKeys.\n\nHong Kong issued a travel alert earlier this week advising against non-essential travel to South Korea, while other governments such as Taiwan have called on travellers to take precautions.\n\nThe trend has had an industry-wide effect with hotels, travel agencies and duty free retailers reporting lower sales figures.\n\nIn a press release, Mario Hardy, the chief executive of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, called for transparency from the authorities\"so that the travelling public are in full possession of all the facts and there is no unnecessary alarm and panic\".\nTL;DR: From an  economic slowdown  to a curtailment in public social life, the  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers)  outbreak in South Korea has taken a toll beyond those killed or infected with the virus.\n\nArticle: The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it acted over emergency care, including paediatrics, following an inspection of two acute sites run by Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospitals Trust (SaTH).\n\nThe watchdog says it will issue a report on its latest findings soon.\n\nSaTH says it is facing\"huge\"emergency demand. \n\nWhile the CQC said it was unable to share detail of its latest concerns about Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal, a SaTH spokesperson said the watchdog's main issue was over children leaving emergency departments without treatment.\n\nThe beleaguered trust was put in special measures in November, meaning inspectors no longer trusted it to run itself alone.\n\nWhen that happened, it was already reporting weekly to the CQC over standards in the hospitals' maternity and emergency care.\n\nSaTH is also being investigated over baby deaths, with the scope of a review widened to include the concerns of 250 families.\n\nOn Thursday, it was fined \u00a316,000 over failures surrounding the discovery of asbestos at the Shrewsbury site.\n\nInspectors visited the hospitals last month.\n\nA CQC spokesperson said:\"As a result we took further urgent action with regard to emergency department care, including paediatrics. \n\n\"We are unable to give further details at this time but will report on our findings shortly.\"\n\nThe CQC added the trust was being\"monitored closely\", with NHS Improvement and NHS England also involved.\n\nSaTH medical director Dr Edwin Borman said:\"We were not able to see all of our patients in 15 minutes, in line with national performance targets, and some of our patients left before we could start treatment.\n\n\"We have alerted our GP colleagues of any children who left our [emergency departments] before treatment, which was the main area of concern for the CQC.\"\n\nNigel Lee, SaTH's chief operating officer, said:\"In Shropshire throughout April we have seen huge increases in emergency demand with over 20% more attendances and 30% more ambulances at our emergency departments.\n\n\"Our staff are working incredibly hard to manage this demand while we await our new recruits who will start with us in June.\"\n\nIn April, 17 new doctors were recruited.

One day, the party might have to choose between Boris and Theresa May - who had directly preceded the London mayor on the conference stage. Which way would they vote in a leadership contest?\n\n\"Ooh. Now you're asking.\"\n\nAfter a considered pause, and a few wavering hand gestures, they seemed to settle on the home secretary.\n\n\"I think he needs to harness his enthusiasm,\"was the woman's verdict on Boris Johnson.\n\n'Permission to purr'\n\nThe speech was, as we are contractually obliged to say on these occasions, vintage Boris.\n\nOnly he could pull off an extended metaphor involving Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, outer space and pensioners sheltering from Ed Miliband's tax policies.\n\nOnly Boris Johnson could describe himself as a\"municipal toenail\"or get a big laugh and a round of applause for hailing a company that produced\"weapons-strength chilli for crowd control\"(\"Believe me, Theresa, they will be begging for water cannon, after that\").\n\nOr get one big laugh after another by waving a house brick around (it's too complicated to explain).\n\nBut this was relatively safe stuff compared with previous Johnson party conference speeches. There was a little tweak of David Cameron's tail.\"You have my permission to purr,\"he said, in a cheeky reference to the Conservative leader's recent HM Queen faux pas.\n\nMr Cameron was - as usual - seated in the audience to witness the London mayor getting more laughs and more applause than he will probably get during his big end-of-conference speech on Wednesday.\n\nBut this year he did not have to grin through gritted teeth.\n\nThere was no flashing of the leg to the right wingers on Europe or taxation. Nothing that could be interpreted as a leadership bid.\n\nJohnson lavished praise on David Cameron, without a trace of irony (well, maybe a little) and stuck to his patented brand of bullish boosterism (the party prizes him for his ability to make Conservativism sound life-affirming and fun, rather than a dry exercise in accounting). \n\nTheresa May also stuck to what she does best. Delivering a stern lecture to the party about complex, difficult issues that they might not necessarily want to think about. \n\nIn this case, the fight against Islamist extremism and the need to stop young black men being searched by the police because of the colour of their skin.\n\nThe London mayor gloried in polysyllabic verbal adventures. Theresa stuck to plain language delivered in a calm, measured, but forceful way. Like a chief constable briefing the media after a grave incident.\n\nJohnson pulled his best deadpan expression as he soaked up the applause.\n\nThere was much less applause during Theresa May's speech and when it came she looked almost annoyed by it. There was no hiding the standing ovation at the end - the speech had gone down well. \n\nShe allowed herself a tight little smile as she hailed her deportation victory over the European Court of Human Rights. \n\nShe was not above a bit of party politics either - bashing the Liberal Democrats for blocking the Communications Data Bill. This elicited a low groan of approval, almost a boo, from the audience.\n\nIt was a tiny touch of pantomime in a very sober, and sobering, address (Johnson, on the other hand, kicked off his speech with a bit of call-and-response that was pure pantomime).\n\nThere are other likely contenders for the leadership if a vacancy comes up. They include, of course, Chancellor George Osborne, who delivered a well-received, serious and - as Ken Clarke called it at an event last night -\"grown-up\"address on Monday. \n\nBut this was a rare chance for party members to see the two other most fancied runners go head-to-head.\n\nThe ones I spoke to thought it was too close to call. But they were at least grateful, they said, for the demonstration of talent at the top of the party.\nTL;DR: They love him alright, but would they vote for him over Theresa May?\n\nArticle: Asia's fourth-largest economy saw gross domestic product (GDP) fall by a worse-than-expected 2.9% in year-on-year terms, the steepest decline since 1998.\n\nExports, which account for nearly 40% of the economy, were the biggest drag as they fell by the most since 1963.\n\nIn recent weeks official figures have confirmed that both Japan and Singapore have also gone into recession.\n\nBut South Korea's finance minister Hong Nam-ki remains optimistic that the economy will recover swiftly.\n\n\"It's possible for us to see China-style rebound in the third quarter as the pandemic slows and activity in overseas production, schools and hospitals resume,\"Mr Hong said.\n\nThe South Korean government has so far implemented about 277 trillion won (\u00a3181bn; $231bn) worth of stimulus measures to tackle the effects of the pandemic on its economy.\n\nHowever, authorities in the trade-reliant nation have very little control over exports, ranging from computer memory chips to cars.\n\nIn another indication of how Covid-19 has hit the region's exporters, Australia has reported its biggest budget deficit since the Second World War.\n\nThe country has swung to a deficit of A$85.8bn (\u00a348.1bn; $61.3bn) for the year ended in June 2020.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg also said the shortfall is predicted to grow to A$184.5bn this financial year as the pandemic pushes Australia into its first recession in three decades.          \n\nIn May, Japan fell into recession for the first time since 2015 as the world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of 2020.\n\nLast week official data showed that Singapore had fallen into recession as second quarter GDP shrank 12.6% on a year-on-year basis.\n\nAuthorities forecast it will be Singapore's worst recession since its independence from Malaysia in 1965.\n\nBut last week, China said it had avoided falling into recession as its economy grew by 3.2% in the second quarter of the year after a record slump in the previous three months. \n\nThe bounce-back followed the biggest contraction in the world's second-largest economy since quarterly GDP records began.\nTL;DR: South Korea has fallen into recession as the country reels from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArticle: The president said he would respect the former pizza chain executive's wishes and not pursue Mr Cain's nomination to join America's central bank. \n\n\"My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him\", Mr Trump wrote. \n\nMr Trump first announced he intended to nominate Mr Cain earlier this month. \n\nThough the president did not formally nominate Mr Cain to the seven-member board, the announcement prompted backlash among Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.  \n\nIn an online column, Mr Cain says he withdrew his name from consideration because the job would mean\"a pay cut\"as he would have to give up most of his business interests.\n\nThe president has been accused of putting forward political loyalists to the Fed.\n\nArguably the world's most influential bank, it is traditionally an independent body.\n\nThe president is a fierce critic of the central bank, and has also often called for lower interest rates - his predecessors have largely refrained from trying to sway monetary policy.\n\nMr Cain would have required almost total Republican support in the Senate to be confirmed.

The deal required approval from the communications watchdog Ofcom, which has now been given.\n\n'Significant progress'\n\nIn the first half of the year, STV made a pre-tax profit before exceptional items of \u00a37m, compared to \u00a36.5m during the same period in 2011.\n\nChairman Richard Findlay said:\"I am pleased to be announcing another period of significant progress for STV. \n\n\"Securing the new Channel 3 arrangements, whereby STV is now an affiliate of the network, is a key strategic development. \n\n\"These arrangements provide stability for our business, our consumers and our advertisers and represent commercially sustainable networking arrangements between the Channel 3 licence holders.\"\n\nAs well as providing the Channel 3 service for most of Scotland, STV is one of four bidders for the new local TV licences for Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nThe company also produces programmes for other broadcasters and announced it had been commissioned to make a daytime cookery series for the BBC. It already produces the Antiques Road Trip for BBC2.\n\nHowever, it was dealt a blow last year when ITV axed its long-running police drama Taggart.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nThe company also warned that it was\"cautious\"about the economic outlook.\n\nSTV's national airtime revenue was down 1% in July and the broadcaster expects a fall of 6% in August, with September expected to be down 2%. \n\nThe company added:\"The regional airtime market remains challenging.

We have an obligation to pave the way of how it should be rather than protecting our own position, and generosity is quite important in that,\"she says.\n\nAs a female leader, she notices that people often try to suggest a uniform way for women to be leaders, such as being louder or more assertive in a situation or to respond to things in a set way.\n\n\"I think we should make a concerted effort to encourage women to be the best leader they can be, rather than a stereotype of how we perceive that should be,\"she says.\n\nFor her, this means avoiding the preconceptions we can have about one other, such as limits to what we can achieve and what work we can do.\n\n\"I'm passionate about smashing glass ceilings and glass walls and I really think we should break down silos between us and boxes and preconceptions,\"she says.\n\nThe trailblazer: Gladys Ngetich\n\nWhen Gladys Ngetich was told in a meeting,'You don't look like an engineer,' she went home wondering what an engineer was supposed to look like.\n\nAs a research student studying mechanical engineering she has got used to fighting stereotypes and being something of a trailblazer.

In some ways, its capabilities now exceed those of the Lebanese army, its considerable firepower used against Israel in the 2006 war.\n\nThe group also gradually became a key power broker in Lebanon's political system, and has effectively gained veto power in the cabinet. \n\nHezbollah has been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets and is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. \n\nSome Lebanese consider Hezbollah a threat to the country's stability, but it is enduringly popular within the Shia community.\n\n'Resistance'\n\nHezbollah's precise origins are difficult to pinpoint, but its precursors emerged following the Israeli invasion of South Lebanon in response to attacks by Palestinian militants in 1982, when Shia leaders favouring a militant response broke away from the leading Amal movement.\n\nThe new organisation, Islamic Amal, received considerable military and organisational support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley, and emerged as the most prominent and effective of the Shia militias that would later form Hezbollah.\n\nThe groups launched attacks on the Israeli military and its ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA), as well as foreign powers in Lebanon. They are believed to have been behind the bombings of the US embassy and US Marine barracks in 1983, which together left 258 Americans and 58 French servicemen dead, and led Western peacekeeping forces to withdraw.\n\nIn 1985, Hezbollah officially announced its establishment by publishing an\"open letter\"that identified the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's principal enemies and called for the\"obliteration\"of Israel, which it said was occupying Muslim lands. \n\nIt also called for the\"adoption of the Islamic system on the basis of free and direct selection of the people, not the basis of forceful imposition\".\n\nThe 1989 Taif Accord that ended Lebanon's civil war and called for the disarmament of militias prompted Hezbollah to rebrand its military wing as an\"Islamic Resistance\"force dedicated to ending Israel's occupation, allowing it to keep its weapons.\n\nAfter the Syrian military imposed peace on Lebanon in 1990, Hezbollah continued its guerrilla war in South Lebanon, but also began to play an active role in Lebanese politics. In 1992, it successfully participated in national elections for the first time.\n\nWhen Israeli forces finally withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah was credited with pushing them out. The group resisted pressure to disarm and maintained its military presence in the South, claiming as justification the continued Israeli presence in the Shebaa Farms and other disputed areas.\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah militants launched a cross-border attack in which eight Israeli soldiers were killed and two others kidnapped, triggering a massive Israeli response. \n\nIsraeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah strongholds in the South and in Beirut's southern suburbs, while Hezbollah fired about 4,000 rockets at Israel. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day conflict, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians.\n\nHezbollah survived the war and emerged emboldened. Although it is has since upgraded and expanded its arsenal and recruited scores of new fighters, there has been no major flare-up along the border area, which is now patrolled by UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese army.\n\n'Political vision'\n\nIn 2008, when Lebanon's Western-backed government moved to shut down Hezbollah's private telecommunications network and remove Beirut airport's security chief over ties to the group, Hezbollah responded by seizing much of the capital and fighting rival Sunni groups.\n\nTo end the sectarian clashes that left 81 people dead and brought Lebanon to the brink of a new civil war, the government backed down and a power-sharing agreement gave Hezbollah and its allies the power to veto any cabinet decision.\n\nIn 2009 elections it won 10 seats in parliament and remained in the unity government.\n\nLater that year, Hezbollah's secretary general Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah issued a new political manifesto that sought to highlight the group's\"political vision\". \n\nIt dropped the reference to an Islamic republic found in the 1985 manifesto, but maintained a tough line against Israel and the US and said Hezbollah needed to keep its weapons.\n\nIn 2011, the group and its allies forced the collapse of the unity government led by Saad Hariri, a Saudi-backed Sunni, with Hezbollah warning that it would not stand by as four of its members were accused of involvement in the 2005 assassination of Mr Hariri's father Rafik.\n\nHezbollah and its allies have continued to be part of subsequent governments, where they wield considerable influence.\n\nAs the war in Syria escalated, thousands of Hezbollah militants went to fight for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, proving decisive in helping pro-government forces recover ground lost to rebels, particularly along the Lebanese border.\n\nHezbollah's involvement in Syria, however, has sharpened sectarian tensions in Lebanon, where the group has been targeted in a series of bombings by Sunni militants.\n\nIts support for Syria's Shia Alawite president and alliance with Iran has also seen a deepening of hostility from Gulf Arab states, led by Iran's main regional rival, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn early 2016, Saudi Arabia led Gulf countries and the Arab League to declare Hezbollah a terrorist group, accusing it of\"hostile acts\".\nTL;DR: Hezbollah - the Party of God - is a Shia Islamist political, military and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon.\n\nArticle: Details of\"repeat victims\", who have repeatedly been taken in by scams, are found and then shared by scammers.\n\nSome of those on the list, which covers England, Scotland and Wales, get 60 pieces of mail a day.\n\nPeople whose names and addresses have been discovered will be contacted by their local authority.\n\nThe database of 160,000 people to be contacted has been put together by trading standards teams from a number of sources, including seized lists, names uncovered in the course of investigations and names picked up from actual pieces of mail seized.\n\nLouise Baxter, head of the National Trading Standards scams team said:\"Data lists are under-regulated and people don't realise the implications when they tick a consent box on a form\".\n\nShe said she was\"shocked\"to find out how scammers use the information they gather.\n\n\"There are companies that test people's susceptibility and then generate lead lists.\n\n\"You can buy details as specific as people who are 80, disabled, live alone, respond to communication and play the Lottery,\"she said.\n\nEssex Trading Standards is alerting 2,700 people whose names and addresses are on the list.\n\nThe organisation was also given about 200 completed forms with cheques, cash, postal orders, stamps and credit card details - including security codes. \n\nA spokeswoman said:\"The money was attached to prize draw applications and orders for confectionery special offers. \n\n\"The forms were found in a PO Box used by known scammers.\"\n\nAnyone who is concerned about a possible scam or is worried about a friend or relative can call the Citizens Advice Consumer Helpline on 03454 04 05 06.\nTL;DR: More than 160,000 people whose names appear on a \"suckers list\" are to be contacted about how to avoid becoming the victim of a scam.\n\nArticle: They include a charter setting out what tenants can expect from a landlord, including to be safe in their home and to know how the landlord is performing in areas like repairs and complaints. \n\nThe housing secretary says it will give tenants\"a much stronger voice\".\n\nBut Labour said the reforms\"appear to water down previous proposals\".\n\nHousing charity Shelter warned there was a\"chronic shortage of social housing\"and that\"any new dawn for social renters must come with major investment in new homes too\".\n\nThe proposals are part of a\"fundamental rethink\"on social housing following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.\n\nThe first phase of the Grenfell inquiry concluded that cladding put on during a refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017, which led to the deaths of 72 people. It is now examining how the tower block blaze could have happened in the first place.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the Social Housing White Paper had been drafted with the views of those devastated by Grenfell in mind.\n\nMinisters say they will\"deliver on the commitment we made to the Grenfell community that never again would the voices of residents go unheard\".\n\nThe White Paper - a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - pledges that complaints to landlords should be dealt with promptly and fairly, and tenants should expect to be treated with respect alongside the backing of a consumer regulator.\n\nAlongside these promises, residents have also been told they will have a good quality home and neighbourhood to live in.\n\nEd Daffarn, a Grenfell survivor and member of bereaved families and survivors group Grenfell United, said:\"If this White Paper is going to make a difference, the (social housing) regulator and the ombudsman need to understand the devastating impact bad landlords can and do have on people's lives.\n\n\"We have little faith that bad landlords will improve themselves - so the responsibility now lies with the regulator and ombudsman to use their new powers to ensure no residents are ever treated how we were.\n\n\"Ultimately it will be for residents themselves to determine if these changes go far enough to making their lives better and homes safer - and creating a lasting legacy for the 72 innocent lives so needlessly lost at Grenfell.\"\n\nThe Social Housing White Paper was born from the shock and grief of Grenfell. The prime minister at the time, Theresa May, told a hushed House of Commons that she would ensure the voice of those living in social housing could never be ignored again.  \n\n\"Long after the TV cameras have gone, and the world has moved on,\"she said,\"let the legacy of this awful tragedy be that we resolve never to forget these people and instead to gear our policies and our thinking towards making their lives better and bringing them into the political process.\" \n\nThere was to be legislation to ensure her promise would be met. Parliament was told it would be a\"wide-ranging top-to-bottom review of the issues facing the sector\"and the\"most substantial report of its kind for a generation\". \n\nBut four housing ministers, three housing secretaries and more than three years later, we have only just seen the government's proposals for the first time.\n\nFew will argue with the measures to give tenants a greater say and to strengthen their rights. But only last September, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also referred to how the White Paper would\"boost the supply\"of social housing.\n\nThere are, however, no firm commitments to increase the number of council houses in England. In the summer, a senior committee of MPs told the government the country needed a net addition of 90,000 social-rented homes a year.\n\nAlthough the White Paper does refer to increasing the supply of social housing (it could hardly fall any lower), its focus is on general affordability, with particular emphasis on what they call\"affordable home ownership\", a product that is out of reach for those on the lowest incomes.\n\nFor some, this is the great hole in the middle of this White Paper. \n\nThe prime minister says the proposals will ensure\"social housing tenants are treated with the respect they deserve\", but critics argue there is too little for the 93,000 households in England currently stuck in temporary accommodation, or the estimated 3.8 million people in need of social housing.  \n\nMr Jenrick has also announced a consultation on making smoke and carbon monoxide alarms mandatory in all rental properties.\n\nHe said the reforms would bring\"transformational change\"that would give social housing residents\"a much stronger voice\".\n\n\"I want to see social housing tenants empowered by a regulatory regime and a culture of transparency, accountability, decency and public service befitting of the best intentions and deep roots of social housing in this country,\"he added.\n\nBut Labour's shadow minister for housing and planning, Mike Amesbury, said:\"The government's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy has been slow at every stage. They were slow to re-house residents, slow to remove deadly cladding, and slow to come forward with social housing reforms. \n\n\"Two years late, this White Paper appears to water down previous proposals. The government must do all it can to ensure a disaster like Grenfell can never happen again. That means tackling stigma, putting tenants' voices centre stage, and ensuring the regulator has real teeth. \n\n\"Today's proposals contain nothing to help the thousands struggling in the private rented sector, make up for a lost decade of social housing, or tackle the housing crisis.\"\n\nThe Local Government Association (LGA) said it was\"paramount that the voice of all social housing residents is heard\".\n\nAnd Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the White Paper was\"an important and welcome milestone in the country's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy\", adding that\"housing associations have demonstrated willingness to be more accountable and transparent\".\n\nPolly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the reforms were a\"welcome step in the right direction in the urgent task of protecting social tenants\". \n\nBut she warned:\"With over a million households already on the social housing waiting list, and many more families potentially facing homelessness as the recession bites, any new regulatory system is being set up to fail unless we build many more social homes.\"\n\nThe White Paper only applies to England as social housing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been devolved.\nTL;DR: Landlords in England are to be held more accountable, the government has said, as part of social housing reforms three years after the Grenfell fire.\n\nArticle: The Trump administration did not notify the EU about the change. The EU has asked the US to explain the move, EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic says.\n\nPreviously it has been US practice to treat the EU delegation and ambassador\"as a country would be\", an EU source told the BBC. \n\nThe US ranks the diplomatic status of international organisations lower.\n\nThe EU source, who declined to be named, said the US had changed the way the diplomatic list was implemented, but not the list itself, which describes the EU as an international organisation.\n\nThe US state department's order of precedence says the head of an international organisation\"should be considered equivalent to a chief of state or head of government, but should be listed in precedence order, after all official representatives of the sovereign nations present\".\n\nChange of protocol\n\nThe change comes amid heightened trade tensions, with the EU anxious to dissuade President Donald Trump from slapping a 20% tariff on all imported EU cars. Last year the US and EU imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on a range of goods.\n\nMs Kocijancic said:\"We understand that there was a recent change in the way the diplomatic precedence list is implemented by the United States' Protocol.\n\n\"We are discussing with the relevant services in the [US] administration possible implications for the EU delegation in Washington. We were not notified of any change. We expect the diplomatic practice established some years ago to be observed.\"\n\nShe stressed that the EU and US\"remain natural partners, natural friends\".\n\nUS diplomatic snub\n\nThe status change was first reported by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. An EU official told it that the EU's Washington ambassador, David O'Sullivan, had not been invited to certain events last year.  \n\nAt the state funeral for the late President George HW Bush, on 5 December, the EU's ambassador was not called up in the usual chronological order, from the longest-serving to the newest ambassador,\"but he was called up as the last person\", the EU official said.\n\nThe previous day, in Brussels, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had questioned the EU's role, in a major policy speech.\n\n\"Brexit - if nothing else - was a political wake-up call. Is the EU ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels?\"he asked.\n\nHe took issue with the liberal consensus view of multilateral organisations, such as the EU, as guardians of peace and security. He did however praise the EU's contribution to European prosperity. \n\nDonald Trump strongly supports UK withdrawal from the EU and has hosted leaders of the Brexit campaign, including Nigel Farage.\nTL;DR: The EU says the US government has changed the bloc's diplomatic status in Washington, in practice downgrading it.\n\nArticle: \"I feel no pressure at all,\"said John Boyega, who will be seen in the JJ Abrams-directed Star Wars: The Force Awakens as a stormtrooper called Finn.\n\n\"I don't think I feel responsibility,\"said Daisy Ridley, whose character Rey is the film's female lead.\"I think JJ probably feels it more.\n\n\"I just mainly want people to think I did a good job.\"\n\nBoyega and Ridley spoke to entertainment correspondent Liza Mzimba about working on one of the most anticipated films of a generation.\n\nLizo Mzimba: Star Wars means so much to so many people, especially those who saw the original trilogy in the'70s and'80s. How much responsibility do you feel?\n\nJohn Boyega: I feel very responsible for my character specifically - for the things we do in the scenes, and for the collaborative energy we have. But, thankfully, we have a great studio who are overseeing the release of the movie, and we have JJ Abrams who is the perfect mix of serious director and fan boy. The responsibility's there, but I'm not the only shoulder it leans on.\n\nDaisy Ridley: I don't think I feel responsibility. I hope people like it, and I hope that it exceeds their expectations. But I don't really feel that responsibility, no; I think JJ probably feels it more. Yeah, I guess it's daunting. But I just mainly want people to think I did a good job - that's my priority.\n\nLM: How ready are you for the recognition you'll get, the media attention and the way your lives will change?\n\nJB: You can never be ready - it's just something that is going to happen regardless. You have to just make sure you have your family and your friends around you, to help you stay grounded.\n\nDR: Ultimately you go home at the end of the day, and your mum's there, your sister's there, your dad's there and your dog's there, and life goes on. It's like when you do photo shoots and stuff, it's a glamour version of me. I know because I look at myself every day in the mirror and I know that's not how I usually look!\n\nLM: Finn and Rey are at the centre of the film. How did your relationship work out? Did you click the first time you met?\n\nDR: It was great, though John feels I slightly lied to him, because I was already cast and he couldn't know that.\n\nJB: The first time I met Daisy was during the auditions; she had been cast as Rey and obviously they were doing chemistry reads with the guys. So I was like,'Are you playing the girl?' And she was like,'No, no. I'm just reading.' Then I found out she was cast and that she knew all along.\n\nDR: But it was great immediately; when JJ told me it was him, I was really, really pleased. And the more I think about what we did, and the more I see of him, I just think he's brilliant.\n\nJB: Yes, since then we've been pretty close. It's been good having her back and supporting her through this whole process.\n\nLM: Appearing in Star Wars is a great thing, but it's no guarantee of a long, successful film career. How much thought have you given that?\n\nJB: There's no guarantee of life, first of all. And second of all, I just think when it comes to the acting career it's all choice. I'm not stressed; I don't borrow trouble from tomorrow. For me, right now is about supporting a movie that I love, a franchise that's been part of my life for a very long time, and just having fun.\n\nDR: I'm quite a hopeful person, and I've been so lucky with what's happened before. When I did Casualty [for the BBC], when I did Toast of London [on Channel 4], that was thrilling to me, and whatever lies ahead I'm sure will be exciting.\n\nLM: Are you concerned that maybe in 20 years' time you might be known, not as John and Daisy Boyega the actors, but as Finn and Rey in Star Wars?\n\nJB: No, that's great. I mean, that's not the worst problem to have in the world. Have you seen the world lately? No, that's going to be absolutely fine.\n\nDR: Harrison Ford is one of the most successful actors ever but he still gets recognised for Han Solo, even though he's done so many incredible things. I would love to be known as Daisy Ridley the actress, but being known as Daisy Ridley who played Rey is also okay.\n\nLM: How hard has it been maintaining the veil of secrecy that has surrounded the film, and keeping things from your friends and family?\n\nJB: I think it's been fine. I support the vision; I love the experience of going to see a film without knowing what happens. I think it's actually a gift to have all this secrecy around it, so I don't have any problem about not telling anyone anything.\n\nDR: I couldn't tell anyone [I had been cast as Rey] for three months, which was probably the most difficult - my friends are actors, and we were sat around talking about jobs and auditions. But then throughout the filming, there were 2,000 people at Pinewood and it was everyone's secret. It feels wonderful, because everyone knows the reason we're keeping it a secret is because we want people to watch the film and go,'Oh my gosh'.\n\nLM: You both seem incredibly calm now. How do you think you'll feel on the day before release, or when everyone starts tweeting and giving their reactions?\n\nDR: It feels like everyone's ready for it to come out now. There's been so much incredible work, so many people having input into it, and we're now ready for everyone to see it.\n\nJB: This is the image I have.

It is due to collect 400,000 gowns.\n\nAnd an organisation representing UK dentists says dentists in England are facing\"critical shortages\"in personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nThe type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Guidelines recommend that anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. \n\nClinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection, including disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. \n\nOn Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesman said:\"We are working as hard as we can with international partners to bring PPE in and at the same time trying to increase domestic supply.\"\n\nThe government had been\"very honest\"about the\"challenges in supply of PPE\", the spokesman said, and the\"problems in ensuring it gets to the right place at the right time\".\n\nThe spokesman also said it was\"not true\"that the government had ignored one supplier, Veenak, saying\"they registered the offer on 5 April and would have got an immediate response\".\n\nAsked about the consignment of PPE from Turkey, which was due to arrive on Sunday, he said the government was\"continuing to work to ensure this shipment is delivered as soon as it is ready\".\n\nEarlier, Ms Reeves, a Labour shadow cabinet minister, tweeted a copy of a letter she sent to cabinet minister Michael Gove on Saturday to express concern about PPE during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nShe went on to tweet that the letter had prompted manufacturers to contact her with concerns that they had not had a response from the government.\n\nIn her letter, she said there was a\"huge desire\"within the UK's textile's industry to help provide protective gear.\n\n\"It is therefore concerning that the government has not been taking advantage of this,\"she wrote.\n\n\"I was particularly concerned to hear industry fears that the government had favoured engaging with major fashion and clothing brands for the production of PPE, over companies that may have been better placed to manufacture what is needed as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFashion retailers in the UK, including Burberry, Barbour and David Nieper, have reopened factories to help boost supplies.\n\nOn Monday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said there was\"no doubt\"some hospital trusts were already experiencing shortages of gowns.\n\nHe said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day.\nTL;DR: The government has had more than 8,000 offers from suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) and is prioritising those of \"larger volumes\", Downing Street has said.\n\nArticle: The quango said it still intended to press ahead with long-term plans to cut its workforce by about 1,550. \n\nBut it said discussions with staff who might be affected would be delayed until\"current flooding has subsided\".\n\nLabour has claimed the jobs of 550 flooding specialists are at risk from the shake-up but the Agency said this was not currently being considered.\n\nThe Agency has been criticised for its performance in recent weeks and for its past policy on river dredging in Somerset, one of the worst-affected areas.\n\nBut its chairman Lord Smith, whose own position has come under pressure, has praised the dedication and professionalism of its frontline staff, many of whom have been working non-stop since the start of December.\n\nThe Agency, which has an annual budget of \u00a31.2bn, announced plans last year to reduce staff numbers from 11,250 to about 9,700 in response to a cut in the amount of money it gets from central government.\n\n'Change programme'\n\nIt has never specified which departments would be affected and it has now confirmed that it has postponed a consultation on potential redundancies until the current crisis is over.\n\n\"We are prioritising incident response above all other work,\"said its programme director Toby Willison.\n\n\"With this in mind, we are reviewing the timetable for the Environment Agency's change programme and will not be entering a formal consultation with staff until the current flooding has subsided.\n\n\"Once we move out of incident response mode, we will refocus our efforts to continue to bring Environment Agency costs in line with our budget from government for 2014-15.\"\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband highlighted job cuts at the Agency during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, urging the government to reconsider what he said was the threat to 550 flood specialists' jobs. \n\nThe BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the 550 figure may have come from an internal exercise into future changes but it had never been confirmed and the organisation said it was not being considered.\n\nThe Agency insisted that any future reductions in staff would not affect\"its ability to respond to flooding incidents\", adding that it would minimise the impact on other frontline services as well.\n\n'Stay of execution'\n\nSpeaking before the Agency's announcement, David Cameron said the reported job cuts had never been confirmed.\n\n\"Those aren't plans that are going to be put in place,\"he said.\"Of course every organisation has to make sure it is efficient -

Only three had working hearing loops at their main ticket or information point.\n\nThe charity said working loops were needed to amplify speech over background noise for people who wear hearing aids.\n\nIt said it is\"absolutely essential\"for the equipment to be maintained.\n\nThe three attractions with working hearing loops were Stirling Castle, McManus Museum in Dundee and St Mungo's Museum in Glasgow.\n\nVenues were also checked by\"mystery visitors\"on whether staff demonstrated that they were deaf aware, and the overall accessibility of the attraction for people with hearing loss.\n\nHigh profile events\n\nThe three highest-ranked attractions were Stirling Castle, the National Museum of Scotland and Holyrood Palace.\n\nAHLS director Delia Henry said:\"As Scotland prepares for major high profile events in 2014, it is crucial that tourist attractions are fully accessible for the one in six people in Scotland who have hearing loss as well as those coming from overseas.\n\n\"People who are deaf or hard of hearing have the legal right to enjoy the same level of service as other customers so it is absolutely essential that tourist attractions ensure that equipment such as loops at main information points are installed, maintained and switched on and that staff are trained in deaf awareness.\"\n\nThe five attractions with the lowest rating were:\n\nA spokesman for Historic Scotland said:\"We take our obligations to provide reasonable access very seriously and for some years have ensured hearing loops are in place at our properties including Melrose Abbey. \n\n\"However we are disappointed that on this occasion the visitor felt the trip to the Abbey was below what was expected.\"\n\nCommunications equipment\n\nHead of marketing at the Scotch Whisky Experience Julie Trevisan Hunter said:\"I feel disappointed that we have been criticised without discussing this with us - if there was an individual training issue or if there is additional equipment we can install, we would always be happy to consider it. \n\n\"As we are refurbishing the welcome desk in January 2014, we will be updating all communications equipment at that time.\"\n\nEilidh Massie, marketing manager at Our Dynamic Earth, said:\"We have measures in place to help those who have hearing difficulties and we are planning, as part of a major refurbishment next year, to install additional facilities to increase accessibility.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the National Trust for Scotland, which runs the Robert Burns Museum, said:\"We have worked hard to try to make the museum accessible to all.\n\n\"We would be happy to meet with Action on Hearing Loss to talk about ways to improve.\"\n\nChris McCoy, of VisitScotland's Accessible Tourism Project, said:\"While many of Scotland's attractions have gone to great lengths to ensure that visitors with accessible needs are catered for, we know that the industry, as a whole, can still improve.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the relevant groups and organisations, together with the industry, to help ensure that all needs are catered for during what will be a major year for Scottish tourism.\"\nTL;DR: Major tourist attractions in Scotland are failing to cater for people with a hearing loss, a charity has said.\n\nArticle: Items from her personal collection are to go on sale at Christie's in London, among them a Burberry trench coat and a selection of ballet pumps.\n\nPortraits, personal letters and her own annotated film script from Breakfast at Tiffany's will also be available.\n\nChristie's said the sale would feature\"unique personal objects which have never before been seen on the market\".\n\nThey include a letter from Tiffany's author Truman Capote and a cigarette lighter - engraved\"For My Fair Lady\"- which she received from that film's art director.\n\n\"We hope the sales will pay tribute to the timeless style of this legendary actress,\"said Adrian Hume-Sayer, the auction house's director of private collections.\n\nThe sale is endorsed by Hepburn's sons Luca and Sean, who said they hoped it would allow their mother's\"ever-growing base of admirers... to share her spirit\".\n\nBorn in Belgium in 1929, Hepburn appeared in many much-loved films, among them Sabrina, Funny Face and Roman Holiday.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress, who died in 1993 at the age of 63, devoted much of her later life to campaigning for Unicef.\n\nThe auction, to be held on 27 September, will be preceded by an exhibition at Christie's London HQ.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Well, you might just get your chance this September.\n\nArticle: The feature triggers the cross-platform messaging app which offers a free alternative to SMS texts.\n\nHTC and Nokia have previously released handsets with Facebook-devoted buttons, but this marks a first for WhatsApp.\n\nAnalysts suggested the move would make WhatsApp the text app of choice on the handsets, but suggested it would have limited impact on the wider mobile phone market.\n\nNokia's Asha 210 runs on the firm's proprietary Series 40 operating system and will be targeted at consumers in emerging markets looking for a cheaper alternative to the Finnish firm's Windows Phone range and other companies' smartphones. The OS supports third-party web apps and software written in the Java programming language.\n\nTo achieve a targeted retail price of \u00a347 ($72) Nokia decided that the device's 2.4in (6.1cm) screen would not be touch-enabled.\n\nUsers have to use its built-in Qwerty keyboard and navigation button to launch and operate apps, so having a dedicated key gives WhatsApp an edge over alternatives on the handset.\n\nIn addition owners of the phone are offered a subscription to the app for the device's lifespan rather than having to pay the normal annual fee.\n\nNokia refused to reveal the financial terms of the arrangement and said it would monitor customer response before deciding whether to include the feature on any of its other devices.\n\nRoom to grow\n\nSilicon Valley-based WhatsApp launched in 2009. \n\nIts chief executive Jan Joum recently told the AllThingsD tech site that his firm had more active users than Twitter which claims more than 200 million people use its service at least once a month. \n\nMr Joum did not give an equivalent figure of his own. However, he did say that WhatsApp processed about eight billion inbound messages and 12 billion outbound messages a day.\n\nAccording to a study published by tech consultancy Ovum, WhatsApp is the world's third most popular social messaging service after Facebook Chat and Google Chat.\n\nReports earlier this month suggested the firm was in talks to be taken over by Google in a $1bn deal - however, they were later denied.\n\nA survey by Ovum suggested that 51% of WhatsApp users reduced the amount of SMS messages sent after downloading the app.\n\nThat threat has prompted some telecom operators including Telefonica to launch their own rival services, while others such as India's Reliance Communications have preferred to sign formal partnerships with WhatsApp itself.\n\nSince Nokia's Asha range is predominantly targeted at consumers in Asia, Africa and the Middle East any benefits from the tie-up will come from those territories.\n\n\"WhatsApp is doing quite well in emerging markets, but you have local players who are outstripping it simply because they are more culturally specific and can therefore outshine the US firm,\"said Neha Dharia, an analyst at Ovum.\n\n\"The most prominent example is in China with WeChat.\n\n\"But the emerging markets still offer huge potential for all the social messaging apps to grow because the amount of mobile internet available is still lower than in mature markets.\"\n\nHowever, another industry watcher questioned what impact the move would have.\n\n\"Having a dedicated hard key is a nice touch and it might help differentiate Nokia's Asha line,\"said Roberta Cozza, research director at tech analysis firm Gartner.\n\n\"But I don't think it will make a big difference for either of the firms involved because there are already lots of affordable low-end full-screen touch-enabled Android phones out there which can be customised to offer quick WhatsApp and other messaging software.\"\nTL;DR: Nokia has released a mobile phone with a dedicated WhatsApp physical button.\n\nArticle: The election is due to take place on Thursday 6 May, 2021.\n\nIt comes after the West Of England Combined Authority's first elected mayor, Tim Bowles, announced he will step down at the end of his first term.\n\nMr Bowles, a Conservative, was elected to the post in 2017, in a devolution deal for Bristol, Bath & North East Somerset and South Gloucestershire.\n\nThe West of England's Mayoral role has seen more local decision-making on roads and house building.\n\nAs part of the government's devolution arrangement, the West of England Combined Authority receives \u00a31bn over 30 years.\n\nThe Combined Authority area excludes North Somerset Council, who elected not to join in 2016.\n\nThose hoping to take on the role are:\n\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Eventually I stopped in 2013 and have been through a long and crippling withdrawal,\"she added.\n\nExplaining what it was like trying to stop taking the drugs, Ms Lewis told BBC Radio Wales:\"As the drug is leaving your system, you have very bad stomach issues, gastrointestinal issues.\n\n\"You become very sick, very nauseous, become very dizzy - it plays a part in your balance - you can have heart palpitations, you're likely to have your sleep affected.\"\n\nBut she added that the drugs can change people's lives for the better.\n\n\"There are many many instances where people will stand up and they will say,'this antidepressant has really helped me, I don't know what I would have done without it', and that is what is accepted everywhere.\n\n\"There is another side to this coin, and what is equally true is that antidepressants can harm people and cause them to have problems.\n\n\"Through this petition and through the people that have experienced the same as me, we are trying to get our voice heard.\"\n\nThe report said there were few services specifically for prescription drug dependence and people were often referred to substance misuse services, which may not be suited to providing the right support.\n\nWhile antidepressants are not addictive, some patients experience difficulties when they try to stop taking them.\n\nCurrent advice on withdrawing from anti-depressants was called\"insufficient and underestimates the challenges related to coming off these medications\".\n\nAMs called on the Welsh Government to restate that antidepressants should not be routinely prescribed for mild depression in guidance to healthcare professionals.\n\nThey said more guidance should be produced and promoted on\"safe tapering of prescription medications, both for patients and health professionals\".\n\nPetitions committee chairwoman Janet Finch-Saunders said:\"Antidepressants and other prescription medications can be a lifeline to many people, however, there is a growing body of opinion that it can be difficult to stop using some medications and that not enough advice is available to patients at the outset.\n\n\"What is clear is that we need to do more to improve the support and information that is available to people who are prescribed these medications. \n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said:\"We invest almost \u00a350m annually to provide a range of services and actions which respond to all forms of drugs (both illegal and legal) or alcohol addiction, this includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines.  \n\n\"We have also previously issued comprehensive guidance and advice to prescribers across Wales.\"\nTL;DR: More priority should be given to dealing with prescription drug dependency in Wales, AMs have said.\n\nArticle: By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent\n\nGillian Quinn works at Bangor Health Centre which is responsible for delivering vaccines to people's homes in the South Eastern Health Trust.\n\nSo far over 2,800 people in Northern Ireland who are clinically housebound have received their first Covid jab.\n\nVaccinating that cohort of patients began on 6 February.\n\nThey have been receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nWhile just under 16,000 people are registered to receive the flu vaccine at home according to the Department of Health a number of housebound people have been receiving their Covid jab at their GP practice as well.  \n\nAmong those to have received their vaccine last week was Dustin Wright who is 49 and lives in Bangor.\n\nMr Wright, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), has been housebound for years and said he was\"relieved\"as he has also been isolating for months.\n\n\"Because I have MS I am a higher risk category so getting the jab soothes my mind and will eventually allow people to call round to the house to visit again,\"he told BBC News NI.\n\nNurse Quinn said she and others are a lifeline to many housebound patients and bringing the vaccine to them is just another development in the Covid story.\n\nShe explained:\"Last March was tough on all of us, we were working in the unknown, we were scared and just trying to get on with doing our job.\n\n\"But almost a year on look how far we have come.\" \n\nBBC News NI spent a day with Gillian as she went about her house calls.\n\nTemperatures outside were below zero and a harsh wind followed Gillian as she walked down driveways armed with heavily laden medical bags.\n\n\"It's challenging but it's also so rewarding when you get to vaccinate people like Dustin who can't leave their house, patients are delighted to see us and we are delighted at being able to give them their jab,\"she said.\n\n'It can be a rush'\n\nOne challenge is that within each vial there are up to 10 doses of the vaccine, which has a short shelf life of about six hours.\n\nGillian is constantly monitoring numbers including those on her watch as she drives between houses vaccinating patients.\n\nThe vial is kept in a portable fridge which is secured in the boot of her car.\n\n\"The cold chain is important, we have to be very regimental with that,\"she outlined.\n\n\"We have to make sure that the vial is kept between certain temperatures and we have six hours to vaccinate 10, possibly 11, people each day. So it can be a rush.\"\n\nAfter leaving Dustin, Gillian travelled several miles to vaccinate Alan McKinney, who is 77 and has dementia.\n\nEach patient gets a cheery greeting as Gillian puts on her personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitises her hands and prepares the injection.\n\nAfter it was administered Mr McKinney said he felt\"100%\"and was happy he and his wife had got their first jab.\n\n'Anxious and frustrated'\n\nIn order to roll-out the vaccine, community nurses work closely with GPs in individual practices.\n\nIt is a well-oiled machine as practices attempt to get around as many of their patients as quickly as possible.\n\nDr David Reid, who is a GP in Bangor Health Centre, said his team was delivering it as quickly as they get it but he acknowledged some are\"feeling anxious and frustrated\".\n\n\"That creates a massive logistical and administrative challenge and that is being met by practice managers and the admin team.\n\n\"To be honest, the easiest thing is putting the vaccine in someone's arm.\"\n\nHowever, the pace of the roll-out is not in step across the country.\n\nAccording to Dr Reid, that is due to what nurses are available in each practice and how quickly they are able to call members of the public to come into the surgery.\n\n\"I'm sure those behind the scenes are trying to do this as equitably as they can,\"Dr Reid said.\n\n\"There are frustrations and anxieties but I think, if we look at where we are in Northern Ireland and as part of the UK, our roll-out has been incredible.\n\n\"I would just ask people to be patient.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health said\"it is anticipated that the vast majority of housebound patients will be vaccinated over the next few weeks\".\nTL;DR: Delivering Covid-19 vaccines to housebound patients is \"like a light at the end of a very dark tunnel\", a community nurse has said.\n\nArticle: Philip Clarke and Laurie McIlwee, who left the firm last year, will receive \u00a31,217,000 and \u00a3970,880 respectively.\n\nThe payments were initially suspended while Tesco investigated last year's \u00a3263m accounting scandal.\n\nTesco said it had taken legal advice and could not withhold the payments.\n\n\"Defending costly claims for the payments would not be in the company's best interests,\"it added in a statement. \n\nIn September, Tesco stunned investors when it announced that it had misstated its half-year profit guidance by \u00a3250m - a figure that was subsequently revised to \u00a3263m in October.\n\nMr Mcllwee resigned as chief finance officer in April last year - before the accounting irregularities were uncovered - while Mr Clarke was ousted in July after he failed to halt a dramatic decline in both sales and profits. \n\nTesco said it was\"contractually committed\"to make the relevant payment to each former director unless it could legally establish a case of gross misconduct against him.\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is currently carrying out a criminal investigation into the accounting irregularities at Tesco.\n\nThe company said that if new information came to light from the SFO probe then it\"will pursue recovery of the payments and damages and has fully reserved all its legal rights in this respect\".\n\nThe announcement comes less than a week after Tesco named the 43 stores it is closing across the country, a move that will put 2,000 jobs at risk.\nTL;DR: Tesco's former chief executive and finance director will share \u00a32.2m in severance pay after the supermarket said it was \"contractually committed\" to make the payments.\n\nArticle: Oscar-nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as coke-snorting hedonist who faces death on his 40th birthday.\n\nPoet laureate Carol Ann Duffy's reworking of the 15th-century morality play is described in one review as\"a seductive spectacle\".  \n\nAnother, however, found it a\"dumbed-down jumble\".\n\nNorris's production features an impressive arsenal of stage effects including a giant video screen, suspended silver statues and a wind machine - along with energetic choreography by Javier de Frutos.\n\nKate Duchene plays God as a cleaning lady who opens the play sweeping the floor. The character of Death is played by Dermot Crowley as a dry-humoured Irishman.\n\nThroughout the 100-minute drama, Ejiofor's character Ev meets an array of allegorical characters as he assesses his past life. \n\nAfter Wednesday's opening night at the Olivier Theatre,  Reuters entertainment editor Michael Roddy described Everyman as\"a strong debut for Rufus Norris\".\n\n\"Ejiofor is convincing as the smooth operator who belatedly sees the light, but the entire cast is terrific,\"he said. \n\nIn his four-star review, Whatsonstage.com's Michael Coveney wrote:\"Ejiofor is a commanding, sympathetic presence in the middle of this energetic and seductive spectacle.\"\n\nIn the Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish struck a note of caution.\"It sounds a little worthy, a touch dull. Is it? Well no. But if anything it swings so far in the direction of looking and sounding with-it and hip that it commits the sin of appearing at once theatrically lavish and dramatically threadbare.\"\n\n'Foul-mouthed' \n\n\"Foul-mouthed, moralistic, atheistic, theatrical; the first big production from the new regime at the Royal National Theatre grabs your attention but it is also a dumbed-down jumble,\"said the Daily Mail's Quentin Letts. \n\n\"Dame Carol, weak with rhyme, strains for topicality. She gives us references to footballers, pop stars, even to a colostomy bag worn by'Sir Cliff'. She may say this is in the spirit of medieval jauntiness. It felt to me more like desperation.\"\n\nBut The Arts Desk's Marianka Swain felt Everyman was a clear signal of intent from Norris:\"an overt state-of-the-nation play\"for the National Theatre.\n\n\"Magnetic Ejiofor provides a much-needed focus for the episodic structure. His sonorous delivery of Duffy's lyrical passages is exquisite, offset by powerful physicality,\"she said. \n\n\"Offbeat but traditional, theatrical but heartfelt, it's a triumphant night,\"concluded Libby Purves on her theatreCat.com blog.\n\nEveryman runs at the National Theatre until 30 August and will broadcast in UK cinemas on 16 July\nTL;DR: Everyman, the first play to be directed at the National Theatre by Rufus Norris since he took charge, has largely impressed the critics.\n\nArticle: By Huw ThomasBBC Wales arts and media correspondent\n\nAppearing at the Hay Festival in Powys to discuss his new BBC adaptation of Les Miserables, Davies said his biggest hit had taken him by surprise.\n\nPride and Prejudice aired on the BBC in 1995 and starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.\n\nAs Mr Darcy, Firth's emergence from a lake has become one of British television's most iconic scenes.\n\nDavies, who was born in Cardiff, said the series had transformed his career.\n\n\"I was amazed, way back, with Pride and Prejudice,\"he said.\n\n\"I knew we had done a good show, I just loved Colin and Jennifer's performances. But I didn't think it would be taken on like it did, I thought it was a minor cultural thing. \n\n\"But it just got these great big audiences, and really changed my life in quite a big way.\"\n\nDavies's TV adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel Les Miserables is currently in production and is due to air on the BBC in January 2019.\n\nHe admitted never having read the book or seen the musical when he was originally asked to consider adapting the story for television.\n\nDavies was appearing at the opening weekend of the festival, which began with an appearance by TV presenter and children's author David Walliams.\n\nMargaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and Benedict Cumberbatch are among the other writers and performers due to appear at the event which runs until Sunday 3 June.\nTL;DR: Screenwriter Andrew Davies has admitted he was \"amazed\" at the success of his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.\n\nArticle: By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring\n\nContracting company Black & McDonald said in a Facebook post that the individual concerned is\"no longer employed\"with them after a video of their anti-social behaviour went viral, Canadian broadcaster CBC reports. \n\nA 45 second clip, filmed on a rear-facing dashcam, shows the unidentified driver veering into the kerb on a rainy day to drench pedestrians at least three times. At the very end of the clip, the company's logo is clearly seen on the side of the vehicle. \n\nThe video has been viewed over 750,000 times, and Black & McDonald subsequently made an apology for their driver's behaviour on its Facebook page. \n\nIt says:\"We apologise to everyone impacted by the recent incident in Ottawa of unacceptable driving by one of our van drivers... This is an isolated incident and the individual is no longer employed with Black & McDonald.\"\n\nA spokesperson also said the company had been co-operating with the police over the incident.\n\n'Case closed'\n\nAccording to the Ottawa Sun newspaper, the driver will not face any criminal charges, with police considering the driver's sacking being punishment enough. \n\n\"We consider the file now closed,\"Sgt.

It was that serious.\"\n\nAlleged health risks explained\n\nAround half the air on board most modern commercial jets is drawn through the engines. \n\nCampaigners say when a fault occurs in the engine seals, a cocktail of potentially poisonous gases can reach the cabin. This includes TCP, an organophosphate known to be dangerous to human health in high enough quantities. \n\nIt is repeated exposure to such fume events - combined with long-term, low-level exposure to chemicals - which some cabin crew believe has damaged their long-term health.\n\nThe problems are said to affect the central nervous system and brain.\n\nThe CAA says there is no evidence that chemicals appear at high enough concentrations to cause harm.\n\nHow safe is air quality on planes?\n\nLawyers and campaigners are closely watching a series of inquests which could influence the outcome of a much larger number of civil cases.\n\nPilot Richard Westgate died in December 2012, aged 43, after complaining of long-term health problems. \n\nLast February, the coroner in the inquest into his death wrote to British Airways and the CAA saying that examinations of Mr Westgate's body\"disclosed symptoms consistent with exposure to organophosphate compounds in aircraft cabin air\".\n\nHe asked them to take\"urgent action to prevent future deaths\". \n\nBoth organisations have since replied to the coroner implying he overstepped the mark and had relied on\"selective and contentious evidence\". \n\nA second inquest is due to open into the case of 34-year-old Matthew Bass who died suddenly in January 2014 after suffering unexplained health problems. \n\nHis family says a specialist post-mortem examination found high levels of toxins in his nervous system linked to organophosphates.\n\nBritish Airways said in a statement:\"We would not operate an aircraft if we believed it posed a health or safety risk to our customers or crew.\n\n\"There has been substantial research into questions around cabin air quality over the last few years. In summary, the research has found no evidence that exposure to potential chemicals in the cabin causes long-term ill health\". \n\nAirbus and Boeing both maintain cabin air is safe to breathe.\n\n'Nocebo effect'\n\nIn 2013, an independent group of scientists, the Committee on Toxicity, looked at the evidence of long-term health effects for the government. \n\nIt could not establish a link between contaminated cabin air and ill health. \n\n\"The levels [of harmful chemicals in planes] were as low or even lower than those in the home or the workplace,\"said Prof Alan Boobis, current chairman of the committee.\n\n\"We can't be sure what the levels are in fume events, which are very rare, but we do have some information which would indicate that even in those circumstances levels are probably below those which would affect health in humans.\"\n\nThe committee believes one explanation could be the so-called\"nocebo\"effect, a psychological condition where exposure to a harmless substance can lead to nausea, fatigue and other medical symptoms.\n\nRecorded incidents\n\nThe following table shows extracts of some of the most critical safety reports submitted by crew to the CAA.\n\nWatch Jim Reed's full film on cabin air quality on the Victoria Derbyshire website.\nTL;DR: Seventeen former and serving cabin crew are planning legal action against British airlines

unduly lenient sentences. \n\nThe minister said sentencing did not just affect the offender, but victims, families and the wider community.\n\nMs Sugden said recommendations would be put out to consultation. \n\nShe said sentencing played a\"major part\"in how the criminal justice system as a whole was perceived and\"impacts on public confidence in the delivery of justice\". \n\n\"I am aware of concerns that have been expressed from time to time about sentencing in some individual cases,\"she said. \n\n\"While such cases represent a very small part of the everyday work of the courts, they can have a significant impact on public perception and confidence in the justice system and the sentencing process. \n\n\"That is why I have decided that a comprehensive review of sentencing policy is needed.\"\n\nThe review will consider the following areas:\n\nThe minister stressed it was not a review of sentencing decisions, as in each individual case it was a matter for the judiciary and the courts.\n\n\"It is essential that their independence is maintained,\"she added. \n\n\"However, it is my responsibility to ensure the effectiveness of the legislative framework within which individual sentencing decisions are made, and, along with the Lord Chief Justice's programme of action, to seek to ensure that there is confidence in how those decisions are reached.\"\nTL;DR: The justice minister has announced a major review of sentencing in Northern Ireland.\n\nArticle: Ms Bracknell, who played Zoe Tate in the ITV soap from 1989 to 2005, was diagnosed a few weeks ago.  \n\nAnd her partner, Jez Hughes, said she wanted treatments that\"are not yet available on the NHS outside of clinical trials and are very expensive\".\n\nA terminal cancer diagnosis can mean being left with only weeks or months to live. \n\nThe NHS offers palliative care, but some patients prefer to seek treatments abroad.\n\nHowever, medical professionals have concerns these may not have been approved in the UK, or even trialled, and could give some patients false hope.\n\nMedications are licensed in the UK only if they have passed robust trials, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which approves drugs for the NHS.\n\nRadio 5 live's Emma Barnett programme found out about the experiences of two people who chose to pay for cancer treatment abroad.\n\n'I sold my house to fund my cancer treatment'\n\nIn May, Pauline Gahan, 61, was told she had stomach cancer that had spread to her lungs and liver and there was nothing the NHS could do.\n\nAfter researching her options, she decided to go to a private clinic in Germany for a form of immunotherapy.  \n\nShe had to sell her house, borrow money and start fundraising to pay for the treatment.  \n\nMs Gahan has now had eight rounds of the treatment and says it has been worth every penny.\n\n\"My son did lots of research on the clinic and knew about a previous patient who had been treated there,\"she says.\n\n\"The initial treatment was \u00a360,000, and I have now spent more than \u00a3300,000.  \n\n\"When I first went to the clinic I could not walk, so we travelled to the clinic in a campervan.  \n\n\"I'm not in remission yet but have just two discreet tumours left in my liver.\"\n\n'We wasted thousands of pounds on private cancer treatments'\n\nMaggie Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 and had a mastectomy.  \n\nDuring follow up tests it was found that the cancer had spread to other parts of her body and was given less than a year to live.  \n\nHer family looked into using a private clinic in Germany for\"alternative\"cancer treatments.  \n\nAfter spending around \u00a3200,000 on treatments at two private clinics Maggie died aged 46 in February 2012.  \n\nMaggie's husband David said he was apprehensive about paying for the treatment but admitted he wanted to do what he could to make his wife better. \n\n\"My wife was desperate and kept fighting to the end. The first clinic charged us \u00a330,000 to heat up the tumour but that didn't work.  \n\n\"We also spent more than \u00a3100,000 at another clinic but my wife didn't live a day longer than was originally expected.  \n\n\"I'm still paying off the debts now\", he said. \n\n'No evidence'\n\nProf Karol Sikora, who has been at the forefront of cancer treatment for the past 40 years, says some clinics can, in some circumstances, feed patients false hope.\n\n\"People with cancer get desperate and upset and grab on to anything which might help them,\"he says.\n\n\"The problem is that some of the treatment will work, but we have no evidence to prove it.\"\n\nBut Prof Alexander Herzog, who has treated hundreds of British patients at his private oncology clinic in Germany, says all the treatments he uses, which include immunotherapy, have proven benefits published in studies.  \n\nHe criticises the\"limitations of the NHS providing certain treatments and not being open to new approaches\", saying his clinic can successfully treat UK patients who have been\"given up on over there with just weeks to live\".\n\nWhat is immunotherapy?\n\nNormally the immune system spots and destroys faulty cells - including cancer cells - but sometimes these can escape detection and develop into tumours.\n\nInstead of targeting the cancer cells themselves, as many traditional cancer drugs do, immunotherapy reawakens the immune system so it can\"remember\"the cancer and stop it in its tracks.\n\nA number of immunotherapy treatments are already showing considerable promise and some have already been approved by NICE for treating cancers, such as skin cancer, on the NHS.\n\nBBC Radio's 5 live Daily programme is on air from 10:00-13:00 Monday to Friday.\nTL;DR: Former Emmerdale actress Leah Bracknell is to receive \"cutting edge\" treatment at a private clinic in Germany after receiving \u00a350,000 in donations on a fundraising website following a terminal lung cancer diagnosis.\n\nArticle: Recent hunger strikes undertaken by some detainees were an\"indication of the unbearable conditions under which they're being held\", she said.\n\nDetainees have been refusing food to protest against living conditions and the length of their detention. \n\nAustralia reintroduced its offshore processing policy in September. \n\nUnder the policy, asylum seekers are sent to processing centres away from the Australian mainland - currently to Nauru and in coming months to Manus island in Papua New Guinea - while their claims are assessed. \n\nThe government says the policy is intended to deter people from paying people smugglers and making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat. \n\n'Last resort'\n\nSpeaking to ABC radio, Ms Pillay said she was\"alarmed\"to hear of the hunger strikes, saying\"it would be a blight on Australia's good human rights record if it doesn't respect the rights of asylum seekers\".\n\n\"I fear that this is another road to indefinite detention,\"she said, adding that\"detention of asylum-seekers should be the last resort, not the first\".\n\nRefugee advocates said that at one point 300 detainees were taking part in the hunger strike - the Australian government said numbers involved were smaller. \n\nMost of the participants are now reported to have ended the strike, following news that human rights watchdog Amnesty International is to visit the camp in Nauru next week.\n\nSince it was reopened in early September, more than 370 asylum seekers - mostly from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan - have been transferred there. They are currently living in tents while more permanent structures are built. \n\nIn recent weeks both the ruling Labor Party and the opposition have suggested that asylum seekers will have to spend as long as five years in camps while their claims are processed. \n\nMs Pillay said she understood Australia's\"obligation to its own citizens to protect them from unwanted or excessive migration\".\n\nBut she suggested there was a double standard for European migrants or migrants arriving by air, who could stay in homes while their claims were processed.\nTL;DR: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has criticised conditions at Australia's offshore processing camp for asylum seekers on Nauru.\n\nArticle: The whale vomited five bags during a vain attempt by conservation officials to save it in a canal in Songkhla province.\n\nThe bags, weighing about 8kg (17lbs), had made it impossible for the whale to eat food, a marine expert said.\n\nA recent report warned the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter was curbed.\n\nThailand is a major user of plastic bags and its government last month announced it was considering a levy on them.\n\nThey are believed to kill hundreds of marine animals there each year.\n\nThe small male pilot whale had been discovered ailing and unable to swim in the Na Thap Canal last Monday.\n\nEnvironmental officials used boats to try to help float the whale and erected a sunshade for it. They nursed the whale through the week but it died on Friday afternoon.\n\nMarine biologist Thon Thamrongnawasawat told Agence France-Presse the bags would have made it impossible for the whale to eat nutritional food.\n\n\"If you have 80 plastic bags in your stomach, you die,\"he said.\nTL;DR: A pilot whale has died off southern Thailand after swallowing 80 plastic bags, Thai marine officials say.\n\nArticle: The Irish prime minister (taoiseach) Enda Kenny confirmed the move during a speech to the Irish parliament.\n\nThe Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an international bailout in November 2010.\n\nIreland is due to leave the EU-IMF bailout on 15 December.\n\nMr Kenny said:\"We will exit the bailout in a strong position. The government has been preparing for a return to normal market trading.\n\n\"We will set out a path to a brighter economic future for our people, a path from mass unemployment to full employment, from involuntary emigration to the return of thousands of people who have to leave for other countries to find work.\n\n\"Today is just the latest step in that ongoing journey, a significant step indeed but also just another step towards our ultimate job of getting Ireland working again.\"\n\nHe added that German chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to work closely with Ireland to improve funding mechanisms for the economy, including access to finance for small and medium businesses.\n\n\"The German government has asked KFW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date,\"Mr Kenny said.\n\nStrategic outline\n\nInternational Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said the performance of Ireland bodes well for the future.\n\n\"The Irish authorities have established a very strong track record of policy implementation. This bodes well as Ireland exits its EU/IMF-supported programme,\"she said.\n\n\"Although uncertainties remain in Europe and the global economy more broadly, Ireland is in a strong position in terms of its bond yields and has built a sizable cash buffer. We look forward to continuing to work with the authorities as they address the challenges that remain.\"\n\nIt is understood a decision not to seek a special overdraft facility was finalised at an emergency cabinet meeting on Thursday, ahead of Finance Minister Michael Noonan flying out to a summit in Brussels.\n\nMr Noonan said the decision was in Ireland's best interests, and that he hoped to publish the main outlines of a medium-term economic strategy before 25 December.\n\nThe Department of Finance said confidence and sentiment towards Ireland has improved considerably in recent months and domestic and international economic conditions were also improving.\n\nDeputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore told the parliament it was an\"historic, important and welcome\"announcement.\n\nHowever, the Labour leader added:\"There will be no celebration until our economic fortunes are fully recovered.\"\n\nMr Gilmore said the renegotiation of bailout interest rates and the Anglo bank promissory note were among the reasons Ireland can cleanly exit the bailout.\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin, leader of the opposition Fianna F\u00e1il party, said a case should be presented by the government on why Ireland does not need a precautionary credit line.\n\nHe said there was no need for a\"stage-managed\"announcement. \n\nSinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams welcomed the move but said the government should not applaud itself for decimating public services and leaving families across the state in poverty.\n\nIndependent member Stephen Donnelly described it as a\"bittersweet moment\"for Ireland and said there was a need for retrospective capitalisation.  \n\nAnother independent member, Shane Ross, said the bond markets would require as much austerity as the Irish government had been\"imposing at the whim of the troika (the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund who provided the bailout)\".\nTL;DR: Ireland is to make a clean break from its three-year 85bn euro (\u00a371bn) bailout programme next month, without seeking precautionary funding.\n\nArticle: They were arrested when police stopped a bus on the Beltany Road outside Omagh on Saturday night.\n\nA police spokeswoman said the teenagers, aged between 16 and 18, have been released pending further enquiries.\n\nIt followed a report of an earlier attack on four boys, aged between 15 and 17, in Strabane.\n\nAt about 21.10 GMT on Saturday, a group of four boys were attacked in the Ballycolman estate, police said.\nTL;DR: Five teenage boys arrested following an incident in Strabane, County Tyrone, have been released on bail.\n\nArticle: DRD will pay Mr Gormley's legal costs.\n\nRegional development minister, Danny Kennedy, said the DRD\"acknowledges that Mr Gormley was not guilty of any personal wrongdoing or misconduct. \n\n\"The department further acknowledges that his removal from office did not reflect adversely in any respect on his character or integrity.\"\n\nMr Gormley has accepted the apology. No damages are being paid.\n\nIn December, Mr Gormley won a libel case against Sinn Fein over press statements.\n\nThe statements were issued a year after the then minister Conor Murphy sacked him from the board of Northern Ireland Water.\n\nMr Murphy has criticised the apology, saying it had not been issued on his behalf.\n\n\"Danny Kennedy's response to recent legal cases displays a serious weakness as a minister and will have longer term implications both for ministerial authority and the ability to investigate allegations made by civil servants and others,\"Mr Murphy said. \n\n\"He has for reasons of political expediency and a desire to try and cause political damage to opponents set these issues and clear advice from senior legal figures to one side.\"\n\nIn a written statement to the assembly Mr Kennedy said:\"Following the recent High Court case in which Mr Gormley was awarded damages against Sinn Fein, he had indicated that all that he wanted from the litigation against the department and the other defendants was an apology and the legal costs incurred in the case. \n\n\"In light of this statement I felt duty bound to ensure that this statement was explored with Mr Gormley's legal advisers. \n\n\"Following tough negotiations by both parties it was eventually possible to reach a settlement on the basis of an apology on behalf of the department and the payment of Mr Gormley's reasonable legal costs but without payment of damages.\"\n\nThe SDLP have called for an independent inquiry into Mr Gormley's dismissal. \n\nJohn Dallat MLA said:\"An independent inquiry is required to provide answers to the many unanswered questions.\n\n\"It is critically important that a thorough inquiry is conducted into the activities of the independent review team on whose recommendations Mr Gormley and his four innocent colleagues were dismissed\".  \n\nTUV leader Jim Allister said:\"I welcome the fact that the public have been spared any further expense.\n\n\"After the result of his libel action against Sinn Fein this outcome was both sensible and just. Mr Gormley is to be commended for settling in this fashion.\"\nTL;DR: The department for regional development has settled a case taken by former Northern Ireland Water director Declan Gormley by apologising to him.\n\nArticle: Rafal Trzaskowski said any plans to discriminate on grounds of nationality would be a\"red line\"issue.\n\nPoland was ready to discuss introducing a system under which all citizens, including from the UK, had to pay in before receiving benefits, he said.\n\nThe UK PM has admitted his plans would need EU support to succeed.\n\nMr Trzaskowski told the BBC's Newsnight Poland was ready to oppose the proposals as they stand.\n\nChanging the rules\n\n\"If one wants to get away with all the benefits that are enshrined in the regulation of the EU and treat immigrants from the EU differently, and for example only pay benefits after four years of their stay in Britain or extradite people who can't find work, that would be against all the existing laws of the EU and obviously that would be a red line for us,\"he said.\n\n\"The Polish government is quite ready to talk about abuses of existing systems, sham marriages, extraditing criminals and so forth.\n\n\"But to be truthful this is not the problem - it is marginal. When it comes to changing the rules in the EU, when it comes to social support and so forth, when it comes to undermining the existing laws, obviously we are going to react quite strongly and we are going to be against.\n\n\"But the most important thing is that David Cameron wants to talk about it and doesn't want to change policies unilaterally.\"\n\nHe added:\"This is an absolute red line, that there is no discrimination on grounds of nationality.\"\n\n'Rule nothing out'\n\n\"If Britain were to change its policy, for example, into a contributory system in which everyone has to pay in to get some money from the system, we then could talk about changes if they were absolutely non-discriminatory,\"he said.\n\nMr Cameron has said lower EU migration would be a priority in future negotiations over the UK's membership and he would\"rule nothing out\"if he did not get the changes he wanted.\n\nHe said he was confident he could change the basis of EU migration into the UK and therefore campaign for the UK to stay in the EU in a future referendum planned for 2017.\n\nBut he warned, in a speech on Friday, that if the UK's demands fell on\"deaf ears\"he would\"rule nothing out\"- the strongest hint to date he could countenance the UK leaving the EU.\n\nIn reaction to Mr Cameron's speech Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron had made a\"no ifs, to buts\"promise at the last general election to get migration down and he had\"no credibility\"on the issue.\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage said the prime minister should have apologised for missing his immigration target, said he was\"playing catch-up\"with UKIP and said the only way to get control over Britain's borders was to leave the EU.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said some of the proposals were\"sensible and workable\"but said there were\"very serious question marks\"over others, including deporting jobseekers after six months if they had not found work.\nTL;DR: Poland will not accept David Cameron's proposal to stop EU migrants claiming benefits for four years, its deputy foreign minister has said.\n\nArticle: By Reevel AldersonHome affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland\n\nNormally courts do not intervene in the decisions of the government, using the principle of a\"margin of appreciation,\"which gives ministers more leeway under the law than that of ordinary people or organisations. \n\nSo the fact that all three judges at the Court of Session have - albeit by different routes - arrived at the decision that they can intervene is highly significant. \n\nStephen Tierney, professor of Constitutional Theory at Edinburgh University, believed the significance of this judgement would be felt not only in the short term but in the longer term also.\n\nHe explained:\"The normal view of the courts is that it would not be appropriate to rule on the exercise of prerogative power.\n\n\"So the long-term significance of this ruling is very important.\"\n\n\"The lower court had said the actions of the executive were'non-justiciable' - meaning they were not to be examined by judges.\n\n\"But this decision indicates the courts are more prepared than many people had expected to intervene in government actions.\"\n\nThe case was brought to the Court of Session by a cross-party group of 75 parliamentarians, who argued the PM had exceeded his powers.\n\nLord Doherty heard both sides of the argument and ruled last week that the issue was for the judgement of politicians and voters, and not the courts.\n\nBut when the case was taken to three appeal judges, they saw it differently.\n\nThey concluded that the PM was attempting to prevent Parliament holding the government to account, ahead of Brexit.\n\nJim Cormack, a constitutional law expert at lawyers Pinsent Mason in Edinburgh said:\"The judges have decided this was a clear case in which the government had stepped outside of the normal room for manoeuvre it is allowed by the courts, when it gave its advice to HM the Queen.\n\nHe added:\"This decision of the Scottish appeal court radically changes the legal landscape ahead of an expected hearing before the United Kingdom Supreme Court next week.\"\n\nWhy did Scotland's judges get involved?\n\nThis case was brought in a Scottish court because at the time the High Court in England was on holiday. \n\nBut that does not diminish the effect of the ruling, as the case was against the actions of the Westminister government which, within the devolution settlement, affects the whole of the UK.\n\nSo the ruling in Edinburgh is binding on the UK government - although this is by no means the end of the legal battle since the case will now be appealed to the UK Supreme Court which will make a definitive decision. \n\nIt is also likely to hear arguments arising from decisions in similar cases brought at the High Court in London under English law and the Northern Ireland High Court. \n\nWhat does proroguing parliament mean?\n\nAlthough proroguing parliament - or suspending it from sitting - is not unheard of, this time it was seen as different.\n\nParliamentary sessions normally last a year, but the current one has been going on for more than two years - ever since the June 2017 election.\n\nWhen Parliament is prorogued, no debates and votes are held - and most laws that haven't completed their passage through Parliament die a death.\n\nThis is different to\"dissolving\"Parliament - where all MPs give up their seats to campaign in a general election.\n\nWhat will happen next, and whether MPs head back to Westminster, will be fought out in both the political and legal arenas.\n\nThe argument for why it was legal to prorogue \n\nThe argument for why it was not legal to prorogue\n\nCourt of Session case: How we got here\nTL;DR: The ruling by Scotland's highest civil court that it was illegal to shut the UK Parliament is -

Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself.\"\n\nA fall in US growth this year to 1.6%, down from the previous 2.2% forecast, will be offset by increases in countries including Japan, Germany and Russia and India, the IMF said.\n\nEconomists for Brexit, a group of eight influential economists which supported the Leave campaign ahead of the EU referendum, criticised the IMF's forecasts arguing their pre-Brexit forecasts had already been proven wrong.\n\n\"The IMF, together with countless other institutions, forecasted a state of Armageddon which hasn't even come close to materialising in the UK,\"said Graeme Leach, member of Economists for Brexit and chief executive of Macronomics.\n\nHe added:\"The UK economy seems to be strengthening, not weakening. Just today, construction PMI was positive, ahead of many gloomy forecasts. \n\n\"Consumer spending is strong, with retail sales up 6% and car sales also growing.\"\n\nThe group said it still expects the UK to grow 2.6% this year and next, unchanged from its pre-referendum forecast.\n\nPattern of underperformance\n\nThe indifferent economic recovery after the global financial crisis has been a persistent theme in the Fund's regular World Economic Outlook reports. \n\nThe latest report warns of the danger of a pattern of underperformance becoming entrenched. \n\nWeak growth can lead to lower investment, slower productivity growth and the erosion of what the IMF calls\"human capital\"- which means skills and expertise. \n\n'Fraying consensus'\n\nThe UK referendum result highlights wider trends in developed economies, the IMF says. \n\n\"The Brexit vote and the ongoing US presidential election campaign have highlighted a fraying consensus about the benefits of cross-border economic integration,\"the report says.\n\nThe US reference is about the hostility to international trade agreements such as NAFTA, which involves the US, Canada and Mexico,) voiced in the election campaign. \n\nThe Republican candidate Donald Trump has been the most vocal, though not the only voice expressing such views.  \n\nIt is a political trend that has the IMF worried. It argues that an environment hostile to trade would make it harder for commodity exporters and poorer countries to develop new lines of exports. Such a trend would also undermine productivity growth and the spread of knowledge and technology. \n\nMr Obstfeld says:\"It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration. Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy's current doldrums.\"\n\nIn one important area - China - the IMF's concerns have eased somewhat in the short term. Growth has been stable, allaying fears that China's widely reported economic slowdown would be much more abrupt than it has been. \n\nHowever, there is a warning about the country's longer-term prospects and the debt burden faced by many businesses.\n\n\"A still-rising credit-to-GDP ratio and lack of decisive progress in addressing corporate debt and governance concerns in state-owned enterprises raise the risk of a disruptive adjustment,\"the IMF says. \n\nThat could have important international implications especially for commodity and machinery exporters, for which China is a vital market.\nTL;DR: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for UK economic growth next year as it warned that the global recovery remains \"weak and precarious\".\n\nArticle: Her death was announced in a statement from executive producer Al Jean.\n\nWallace won an Emmy in 1992 for her work on The Simpsons, as a jaded, grumpy fourth-grade teacher, forced to put up with Bart's antics.\n\nJean said her\"irreplaceable character\"would be retired from the show.\n\n\"I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace,\"he said on Saturday. \n\n\"She was beloved by all at The Simpsons. It's a terrible loss for all who had the pleasure of knowing her.\"\n\n'A legend'\n\nWallace had played Edna Krabappel since The Simpsons began in 1990.\n\nHer character was known for the catchphrase\"Do what I mean, not what I say\"and exclaiming\"Ha!\"in disgust.\n\nIt is unclear when the actress died or what the cause was. \n\nShe had previously survived breast cancer, which she wrote about in her memoir Don't Look Back, We're Not Going that Way, published in 2004.\n\nBefore appearing in The Simpsons, Wallace played receptionist Carol Bondurant on The Bob Newhart Show and guest starred on popular shows in the 1970s and 1980s such as The Love Boat and Magnum PI.\n\nBill Schultz, an award winning writer and producer on The Simpsons, paid tribute to her.\n\n\"She's an icon and a legend, just a hard worker,\"he told BBC Radio 5 live. \n\n\"When somebody like that comes onto a show and takes on the character, all of a sudden, you know that character in a three dimensional way. She brings life to something that's written on a page.\"\n\nHarry Shearer, the voice of her on-screen husband Ned Flanders, told the Associated Press that Wallace\"brought this huge, positive energy\"to her work on The Simpsons.\n\n\"She was just a warm and wonderful person,\"he said.\n\nExecutive producer Jean stressed that previous hints that a regular character on the show could be killed off in the next series were unrelated.\nTL;DR: The US actress Marcia Wallace, best known as the voice of Bart Simpson's teacher Edna Krabappel, has died at the age of 70.\n\nArticle: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter\n\nWhat message will Theresa May take with her to Italy next week? Inside Number 10, the view is not to spill a single fagiolo, a bean, before the words come out of her mouth.\n\nThat's not just because they want the story to be told on her own terms in her own words, when she is ready to tell it. \n\nBut also, perhaps, because I'm told that she is yet to have signed off the full contents with those members of the cabinet who might object to some of it.\n\nAnd frankly, at this stage, it is extremely difficult to get to the bottom of what the precise thinking in government really is, about the next move on Brexit.\n\nAnd it is also very hard to understand exactly what the views really are from the different parts of the EU machine.\n\nIn the coming days, I'm told Boris Johnson is likely to see the PM. She'll try to square him on her plans, with private suggestions that she has to persuade him to accept cash going to Brussels. \n\nThat would go against, of course, what he suggested in the referendum campaign, and also how he evoked the memory of Margaret Thatcher earlier this year, by mentioning the\"illustrious precedent\"of Fontainebleau. \n\nI'm told Theresa May has not yet put a proposal to the foreign secretary that would involve continued payments to the EU during a transition period for a couple of years after the UK leaves the EU, or to other Brexiteers. \n\n\"She has yet to try it on for size with these people\", I was told. And sources suggest it will be hard for Mr Johnson to stomach in particular.\"I can't see him turning and agreeing that's palatable,\"one source said.\n\nThe prevailing wind however in the cabinet, as the chancellor even said publicly this week, is for a transition period that looks rather similar to the status quo, and to retain some of those privileges -and burdens - would have to involve some payments.\n\nIn fact, there are whispers that UK officials are ready to put just such an offer on the table.\n\nFee for access?\n\nPrevious speculation seems to be solidifying around a potential\"sensible offer\"where the UK would offer to pay \u00a310bn a year for three years, in return for continuing access to the single market, while business disentangles itself from the EU and the final details of a permanent trading relationship are hammered out.\n\nThat would seem a specific price for a specific outcome, a fee for access, rather than one enormous Brexit bill. Under this plan, the longer term liabilities of the UK to EU pensions, and other assets, would be settled over time by committees, with the political sting removed.\n\nBut it's not just confirmed Brexiteers who might find that hard to accept. Whispers suggest that while France and the EU Council would accept that broadly as a fair deal, Germany and the EU Commission see that as not good enough.\n\nA UK government source tells me that, on the issue of the bill, France and Germany are split. It's not clear however what the view is of the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. \n\nBut remember his mandate comes from the member states, he is unable to make compromise decisions on his own.\n\nDivisions inside\"the 27\"are denied in Brussels, where they are described as\"wishful thinking\"by the UK. \n\nHere, the speech is so sensitive no one will be drawn on the record. But one former diplomat, familiar with the talks, told me there is a chance for the UK to throw the EU\"into disarray\"- put forward that\"sensible offer\"and destroy the unity the 27 other countries have worked so hard to preserve. \n\nThat could in theory, in turn, crack open the impasse in the talks and give the UK the advantage. \n\nThe Florence speech has the potential perhaps to be a game-changing moment in this vital process. \n\nBut could Theresa May's cabinet stomach the offer that might finally open up a British advantage?\nTL;DR: No sooner had her next European adventure been confirmed than the speculation began.\n\nArticle: John Lamb knew three of the victims when working at Nottingham High School, and met another at a cricket match before showing him around Loughborough University, where he then worked.\n\nThe 66-year-old, of Park Road in Loughborough, was found guilty of 10 counts of indecent assault at a trial at Nottingham Crown Court.\n\nJudge Sally Hancox said Lamb carried out\"predatory offending\".\n\nThe court heard Lamb, who left the education profession in 2011, carried out the offences against the four boys during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSome offences were carried out in school, while others occurred at Lamb's home address.\n\nProsecutor Sarah Knight read out statements from the victims, with one describing being\"trapped in a confined space\"and groped after Lamb\"targeted\"him.\n\nAnother said Lamb's actions\"clouded my thinking over my sexuality\".\n\nOne statement added:\"The effect of child abuse ripples far beyond the initial events.\n\n\"The actions of John Lamb have had a significant and sustained impact on me.\"\n\nDefending, Andrew Wesley said Lamb had been a well-respected teacher who had\"affected the lives of many, many young people for the better\"over his career.\n\n\"Even one or two of the victims themselves conceded his teaching was exemplary,\"he said.\n\nJudge Hancox said Lamb, who was cleared of one count of indecent assault, was\"an intelligent and sadly manipulative man\".\n\nShe said he exploited the victims to satisfy his\"desire to control\"and forced each to recount their abuse during the trial.\n\n\"Each of your four victims was told, in effect, that they were each a liar,\"she said.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

I've been tracking the weather and it's already -10C and -15C in some places and it's already starting to snow.\n\n\"I've given so much of myself this year, I've tried so hard to cycle around the world and now I'm faced with a situation that I can't.\"\n\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland from Brisbane, Mr Quigley said he would now fly to Edinburgh on Sunday to renew his passport.\n\n\"I had given up because the last few days had been really tough for me but then I sat and thought about it and I thought'no, I have to finish this no matter what'.\n\n\"It's my seventh attempt and I've never got as far as this before so I have found a way to carry on.\n\n\"There is a lot of pressure on me but I have faith no matter what and I refuse to give up despite this latest setback.\"\n\nHe will cycle from Adelaide in Australia, where he left off, to Brisbane.

I was a couple of stone overweight, I was drinking alcohol four times a week - but cycling was my way of trying to get happy again.\"\n\nAfter losing his father to leukaemia in 2018, he slipped into depression once again before deciding to embark on his seventh attempt around the world.\n\nMr Quigley wants to get back in time for Christmas to be there for his mum and brother.\n\nHe said it would be tight and it may mean he now returns on Christmas Day.\n\nHe said: I'm feeling really up for it, I can do this and I will.\"\nTL;DR: A cyclist forced to abandon his seventh attempt to ride around the world after his passport was damaged has decided not to give up despite the setback.\n\nArticle: The 48-hour strike, which began at midnight on Tuesday, is part of a long-running dispute over the role of conductors on trains.\n\nSouthern said 62% of its services are running.\n\nThe RMT said the strike was\"rock solid and determined\"and called on the government to\"force Southern back to the negotiating table\".\n\nFurther stoppages are planned around Christmas and over the new year.\n\n'Pure misery'\n\nGovia Thameslink (GTR), Southern's parent company, said on strike days it used\"contingency conductors\"- members of the management team.\n\nCommuters took to Twitter to vent their anger.\n\nBecky Aston posted:\"Between @SouthernRailUK and @RMTunion mornings are a pure misery.

How could no-one believe I was me?\"\n\nHe was taken to court and, after three nights in a cell at Addiewell Prison, he was released without any explanation or apology.\n\nAfter his release, Mr Webb, a former timber yard manager, made a formal complaint for wrongful arrest but after two years this was rejected by an internal police investigation and recorded as a\"quality of service issue\".\n\nHe then contacted the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) who ordered the arrest of five officers and reported them to the Crown Office over allegations of criminal neglect of duty and attempting to pervert the course of justice.\n\nFollowing a two-year investigation, the Crown Office said none of the five officers would face prosecution.\n\nMr Webb said:\"I experienced things I should never have had to.

But he added that it was important that inflation did not get stuck permanently below 1%.\n\nPeter Vanden Houte, ING's chief eurozone economist, said:\"Today's figures show that it's too early for the ECB to become complacent about deflation risks, especially in peripheral countries.\"\n\nThe euro rose to $1.3646 from $1.3618 on speculation the ECB might take more action to support the eurozone' economy. \n\n'Weakest'\n\nIn October, the eurozone's inflation rate fell to 0.7%, the first time it had dropped below 1% since February 2010. This prompted the rate cut from the ECB.\n\nIn Tuesday's figures, analysts highlighted the\"core\"rate of inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco. This fell to an all-time low of 0.7%.\n\n\"It constitutes the weakest reading on record and reflects a marked slowdown in services price inflation,\"said James Ashley, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe worry is that muted wage rises and high unemployment in the eurozone will continue to force prices lower. Meanwhile, the relatively high value of the euro has made imports cheaper, while making exports more expensive. \n\nEurostat also released industrial producer price data for November, showing a 0.1% fall on the month after a 0.5% drop in October.\nTL;DR: The eurozone's inflation rate fell to 0.8% in December, official figures have shown, down from 0.9% in November.\n\nArticle: Filter Bubbles of BritainBy BBC Trending\n\nRosanna Lowe was listening to soothing Georgian and Gregorian music on YouTube when political advertising broke her reverie. Lowe says that, on one recent day, she clicked on 15 different songs - and each was preceded by a Conservative advert.\n\n\"It was like I was going mad,\"Lowe told BBC Trending.\"It was like I was trapped in some kind of Tory Groundhog Day.\"\n\nYouTube adverts appear to be a one big component of the Conservatives' digital campaign. But there is evidence to suggest that the political parties are not able to target YouTube users with much precision. \n\nAlong with BBC Newsnight and local radio, Trending has crowdsourced more than 500 political adverts across social media platforms. On Facebook, we've reported on the big money campaigns of the major political parties, and the self-funded efforts of grassroots groups. But a lot of ads are served up on other platforms too - with YouTube being the biggest - and in recent days we've noticed curious things about how broadly these are being'served' to audiences.\n\nJames McAteer was watching WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) videos on his laptop when he saw a Conservative advert criticising Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. This advert has gone viral online - perhaps boosted by paid-for advertising - but McAteer was taken aback when he was shown it on YouTube. \n\n\"I knew that the political parties were advertising on social media, but it didn't seem appropriate for me to see this advert,\"he says.\"When political ads are shown in a party political broadcast on TV we are told what it is and I can choose to watch or not. With this type of ad I have little or no choice to listen or watch.\"\n\nThis type of apparently general advertising differs from the highly targeted Facebook campaigns coming from the major parties, who have made use of data collected by the social network, including age, location and political views - which can be either provided by Facebook users, or deciphered from their\"likes\". For instance, the Conservative Party has targeted voters in key constituencies with anti-Jeremy Corbyn ads. \n\nOn YouTube, things are different. Viewers, listeners and readers have reported that they've seen Conservative YouTube ads in some of the safest Labour seats in the country, and many people unlikely to vote Tory have also been served the ads. \n\nChris Evans was chatting to his 10-year-old son about the upcoming general election, when his son firmly responded that he did not support Corbyn because of the Labour leader's stance on NATO. \n\nEvans, a member of the public who sent us the advert, was surprised by this mature contribution. However, when he pressed his son on the source of this information - presuming he'd overheard a teacher or a school friend - he found that his son's anti-Corbyn attitude had in fact been shaped by Conservative adverts on YouTube.\n\n\"Frankly, I was shocked - as perhaps I was naively unaware of political advertising on YouTube,\"he told Trending.\"As he rarely watches TV, the internet is now a primary source of information. The problem is, these ads are not the subject of balanced debate and argument.\"\n\nBut not all voters share such concerns. Another person who sent us an ad, Mike Quinn, saw a Conservative advert on YouTube while he was watching guitar pedal demonstration videos. He doesn't see much difference between traditional ads and social media campaigning.\"In principle, YouTube advertising is no different to the old-school loudspeaker vans that used to go around the streets urging us to'Vote for the Labour Party' or party political broadcasts,\"he told Trending. \n\nPaid-for political advertising on TV is banned in the UK, but the Electoral Commission told Trending that there are no specific laws regulating the output of political advertising on YouTube or any other social network.\"The political parties just have to report their total YouTube and social media spending to the Electoral Commission after the election,\"a spokesperson said. \n\nPolitical adverts on social media are also less visible than traditional forms of advertising, such as billboards, because social media ads generally can only be seen by those individuals who receive them. \n\nMore on political advertising from BBC Trending\n\nMeet the'micro-Pacs' buying political ads on Facebook\n\nThe rise of Tory attack ads on Facebook\n\nFilter Bubble Britain: General Election coverage from BBC Trending\n\nElection 2017: How can you pop your filter bubble?\n\nA Tory walks into an SNP bar...\n\nPro-Brexit Facebook groups: Conservative converts?\n\nIn addition to YouTube, the Conservatives seem to be expanding their advertising footprint to Snapchat. Several individuals reported seeing Tory adverts on the youth-oriented network - including one who saw a Conservative advert just after he had finished watching a Snapchat story from Jeremy Corbyn. It is not clear how that ad reached the user; whether the Conservative Party paid for it to be delivered to Corbyn's Snapchat followers. However, it's clear that the Conservative Party is trying to spread its reach across a wide range of social networks.\n\nThe majority of adverts seen by our readers have been paid for by the Conservatives. This might be explained by our unscientific methodology - Labour supporters might have been more motivated to send us examples of Conservative ads than vice versa. However, the Conservatives have in the past invested more heavily in online advertising than the other parties. During the 2015 election campaign, the Tories spent over \u00a3300,000 on Google advertising (including YouTube ads), whereas Labour only spent \u00a3371. \n\nAdverts have also been placed on lesser known social networks and apps not considered to be traditional locations for political messages. Several people told Trending that they had seen Conservative videos pop up on popular mobile phone games.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Labour is relying less on paid advertising in order to spread its message. Corbyn boasts more than double the number of Facebook likes than May, and this unpaid online army has proven effective at spreading Labour's message organically. Yet, although the methods of political parties might be different, their intentions are the same: to win over swing votes ahead of 8 June.\n\nBlog by Sam Bright\n\nWe're still keen to get a better understanding of social media advertising during the general election. \n\nIf you spot an advert in your social media feed which looks political then please send us a screengrab or a link to the content.

Food [was left] out at room temperature, very high-risk food like rice. And [there were] no records.\"\n\nThe pub has a zero hygiene rating - meaning it is in need of\"urgent improvement\".\n\nBut that is not just an issue for those who eat at the pub. It also offers a takeaway service - with a listing on Just Eat.\n\nAnd on that app and website, it gets a four-star customer review rating - but the hygiene score is not disclosed. \n\nWhat happens next differs between the nations. Restaurants in Wales and Northern Ireland must display their rating prominently.\n\nIn England, many outlets choose to do so, particularly if it shows a high score for hygiene, but it is not mandatory. \n\nScotland has a different system, with just three ratings - Pass, Improvement Required and Exempt Premises (which are given to premises such as newsagents or chemists that are checked but are not predominantly food businesses). Ratings are then displayed on the Food Standards Agency website.  \n\n'Serious about food safety'\n\nJust Eat, which describes itself as\"a world leader in online and mobile food ordering\", said it was\"actively working to raise standards\".\n\nIt said the company offered free accredited food hygiene training to any restaurant that signed up to the platform. \n\nIt added:\"Whenever any potential food safety issues are brought to our attention, our restaurant compliance team will review, investigate and liaise with the local authority.\"\n\nThe company pointed out that for each outlet, it already does include a link to the Food Standards Agency website, at the bottom of both the menu and the information page. Customers do then need to input the name and postcode of the restaurant on the FSA website to find the relevant hygiene rating.  \n\nBut consumer rights campaigner Chris Emmins says he believes this is not enough and wants Just Eat to display the hygiene rating for each restaurant on their individual entry.\n\nThis is an idea that Just Eat says it is willing to try out, with a trial planned for Northern Ireland outlets, so it can\"test and learn what customers want\".\n\nMr Chris Emmins believes Just Eat also needs to lead a more active change.\n\n\"There is a duty on all businesses to safeguard their customers, and it's no good saying you are just an agent,\"he said. \n\n\"If that was a standard traditional business, a supermarket or a travel agent, they would be hauled over the coals considerably for a failure for that sort of lack of due diligence.\"\n\nMs Statham, from Ealing Council, added her frustration. \n\n\"Members of the public are of the view they are buying their food from that business, but I think at the same time there is a responsibility or a part to play by somewhere like Just Eat in order to help to improve those standards,\"she said. \n\nJust Eat entered the FTSE 100 last year and now employs more than 2,900 staff across 12 different countries.\n\nFood outlets pay to sign up to the platform, and, in return, Just Eat promotes the business and takes orders and payments - with the outlet charged a commission on each order.\n\nA rating appears alongside the listings, but this is generated by collated customer scores rather than decided by Just East itself.\nTL;DR: Many takeaway shops in England with a zero rating for hygiene are among those listed on the Just Eat food ordering app, a BBC investigation has found.\n\nArticle: The move comes as the US stepped up its airport security, although the Department for Transport (DfT) said there was\"no change to the UK threat level, which remains at substantial\"- the third of five possible threat levels. \n\nSo what has changed and what will it mean for passengers?\n\nWhat are the new restrictions on charging devices in your hand luggage?\n\nAll passengers flying into or out of the UK will have to be able to prove electronic and electrical devices in their hand luggage are sufficiently charged to be switched on. \n\nWhat gadgets are included?\n\nThe DfT guidance includes devices such as:\n\nThe general advice applies to anything\"with a battery\", so other items such as handheld games consoles and e-readers could also be checked.\n\nWhat will happen if my device cannot be switched on? \n\nThe government guidelines say passengers carrying devices which they cannot switch on\"face not being allowed to bring the device onto the aircraft\". Passengers would then have to choose between charging the device if possible, leaving it behind (see below) or not getting on their flight.\n\nWhat will happen if I leave an electronic device?\n\nSome airlines have outlined ways customers can get their devices back. British Airways said passengers could either keep devices at airports for customers to collect or have them forwarded to another address, at the airline's expense. Virgin Atlantic has said likewise. EasyJet said it was seeking clarification from the government on the new regulations and had not, so far, issued any specific instructions to passengers.\n\nCan I charge my device at the airport?\n\nTo avoid the risk of missing your flight or having your device taken away, make sure it is fully charged and check that the airport you are travelling from has a charging point. If for any reason you have a device with a flat battery, charging points are available near security in most airports - so if you have enough time before your flight you should be able to charge it up. \n\nWhat flights are affected? \n\nThe DfT said the changes would affect\"some routes into and out of the UK\", but added:\"For obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on the routes affected.\"All passengers flying to or from the UK are advised to charge electrical items they wish to carry as hand luggage.\n\nWhy are these measures being put in place?\n\nThe UK government is acting\"in line\"with advice from the US, which recently warned of a\"credible\"threat of terrorism. US authorities did not give specific details of this threat. The DfT would not comment on why people carrying electronic devices needed to show they could switch on. Analysts have suggested the new rules could be a response to efforts by Islamic militants in Syria and Yemen to build bombs that evade airport security checks.\n\nHow will long will the measures be in place?\n\nThis is not known. The DfT said it would\"not be commenting in detail on the measures\".\n\nUK Airport security\n\n\n\n228m\n\npassengers on international flights to and from the UK per year\n\n91%\n\npeople over 16 use a mobile phone in the UK\n\n20,000 fly daily from Heathrow to the US\n\n4,500 charging points at Heathrow \n                \n\n40+ UK airports fly to international destinations\n\nDo I need to leave more time when catching a flight?\n\nThis seems to depend on who you ask. British Airways is advising its passengers to allow extra time at various stages of their journey, from checking in to the boarding gate. But very few delays were reported when the new rules came into force, and Heathrow Airport has said passengers do not need to allow extra time in light of the new measures.\n\nDo the previous restrictions on hand luggage still apply?\n\nNormal hand luggage rules are still in place, including restrictions liquids and sharp objects. The DfT website has full details.\nTL;DR: Travellers are being advised to power up electronic devices in hand luggage as part of new security measures introduced at UK airports.\n\nArticle: By Sherie RyderBBC UGC and Social News\n\nAlastair McAlpine, from Cape Town, tweeted:\"I asked some of my terminal paediatric palliative care patients what they had enjoyed in life, and what gave it meaning. Kids can be so wise, y'know. Here are some of the responses.\"\n\nDr McAlpine told the BBC he wanted to write something uplifting, and was overwhelmed when he saw hundreds of responses to his tweet, which has been liked more than 10,000 times. \n\nAt first he tried to respond to each comment. He said:\"It's extraordinary. I believe in thanking people when they say something nice, but there were just too many for me to reply to all of them.\"\n\nNone of the children, aged between four and nine, said that they wished they had watched more television, or spent more time on Facebook.\n\nAnimals played a huge part in their lives as they enjoyed talking about their pets. Dr McAlpine tweeted examples:\"I love Rufus, his funny bark makes me laugh; I love when Ginny snuggles up to me at night and purrs; I was happiest riding Jake on the beach.\"\n\nDr McAlpine trained in palliative care in May 2017 after he saw a huge gap in paediatric care.\n\n\"When it came to kids dying, it seemed we weren't prepared for what to do. The best part of my job now is that I get to meet these extraordinary children and families. I walk a special road with them,\"he says.\n\n\"As horrible as it is when a child dies, one of the best rewards is a dignified and pain-free death. If I can make their lives slightly less bad, it's worthwhile. That keeps me going.\"\n\nOne person who was impressed with the paediatrician's tweets, was Canadian obstetrician, Dr Jennifer Gunter, who has frequently written about Gwyneth Paltrow's advice on the actress's lifestyle website. \n\n\"I was pretty star-struck when I saw Jennifer's comment. My partner will probably roll her eyes at me. I think she's liked a grand total of two of my tweets.\"\n\nSome people online asked how the paediatrician copes with working with terminally ill children, while others just admired both the medical staff and the children:\n\nAfter a child's death, parents often continue a relationship with their child's doctor, which Dr McAlpine says is a\"huge compliment.\"\n\nFrom his online thread, the children also worry about their parents as one of his tweets read:\"Hope mum will be OK; Dad mustn't worry, he'll see me again soon.\"\n\nYou  might also like:\n\nAll of the children loved ice cream and books. But many wished they had spent less time worrying about what others thought, and about losing their hair or how their scars looked.\n\nIt's no surprise that kindness, laughter, toys and family were all very much valued by the children. As his threads unfolded and the comments poured in, Dr McAlpine left this take-home message:\"Be kind. Read more books. Spend time with our family. Crack jokes. Go to the beach. Hug your dog. Tell that special person you love them... and eat ice cream.\"\n\nWorking in palliative care can be heart-wrenching, but Dr McAlpine says he works with some\"lovely people\"at Paedspal Cape Town - a programme providing care for terminally ill children.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary team. We believe in a holistic approach to care.\n\n\"The negativity can get me down. But I glean inspiration from the parents of these children.\"\nTL;DR: When a palliative paediatrician in South Africa saw too many negative stories appear on his Twitter feed, he decided to share some positive, inspiring thoughts of the terminally ill children in his care.\n\nArticle: The planemaker was forced to ground the aircraft, which had been its best seller, in March last year after two deadly crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nNow it has said that it expects the bill for the grounding to surpass $18bn (\u00a313.8bn).\n\nThat has hurt the firm's finances, pushing it to a $636m loss for 2019.\n\nSales were worse than expected in the final three months of last year when the planemaker booked $17.9bn in revenues.\n\nThat was much lower than $21.7bn that had been expected by analysts.\n\n\"We recognize we have a lot of work to do,\"said Boeing's newly-appointed boss David Calhoun. \n\nHe replaced Dennis Muilenburg who was fired late last year following his handling of the crisis at the company.\n\n\"We are focused on returning the 737 Max to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public,\"said Mr Calhoun. =\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSamira Hussain, BBC business reporter, New York\n\nThis was not necessarily the best first earnings report for the newly appointed chief executive of Boeing. There were some eye-catching headlines: more than $18bn in costs associated with the Max crisis; it's first loss in more than two decades; plummeting sales. \n\nBoss Dan Calhoun's primary focus is to first get the planes back in the air quickly and safely, making fixes, giving pilots extra training and convincing regulators.\n\nBut he also needs to re-establish broader confidence in Boeing planes - and that will be far more difficult. Yes, Boeing has been in communication with its airline customers about when the jets may be airworthy again. \n\nBut how do you convince the public that the aircraft responsible for 346 deaths, countless investigations and billions of dollars in fixes is safe to board?\n\nThe cost of 737 Max crisis was thought to have reached around $9bn but Wednesday's announcement suggests the final bill could be more than double that.\n\nThe return to service of the 737 Max has been repeatedly delayed. And last week, Boeing said it did not expect the fleet to return to the skies before the summer.\n\nBoeing has been working on fixes to try to get the 737 Max planes back up and running.\n\nAnd in an interview with CNBC, Mr Calhoun said he expected the firm would meet deadlines set by regulators.\n\nMeanwhile, he said that - despite the two fatal crashes - he did not plan to rebrand the 737 Max.\n\nThe company had a total backlog in orders worth $464.4bn.\n\nBoeing's share price climbed on Wednesday, soaring by more than 4%.\nTL;DR: Boeing has reported its first annual loss in more than two decades as the 737 Max crisis continues to hit the firm.\n\nArticle: However that was offset by strong sales of its luxury Jaguar and Land Rover brands.\n\nNet profit for the January to March quarter was 39.18bn rupees ($665.48m \u00a3398m), down 0.7% on the same period a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, net sales were up 16% to 647.16bn rupees.\n\nThe company reported a foreign exchange loss of 3.55bn rupees, due to a revaluation of borrowings, deposits and loans in foreign currencies.\n\nSales at Jaguar Land Rover were up 8%, with\"robust demand\"for the Jaguar XJ and XF models, \"and buoyed by the introduction of the new F-Type\".\n\nIn India deliveries of cars, trucks and buses fell by 36% in the quarter,  \n\n\"Sustained deceleration in the economic growth leading to weak consumer sentiment, high inflation, higher fuel prices, reduced availability of finance, elevated interest rate regime, continues to impact the demand for the entire auto industry,\"Tata said in its financial report.\nTL;DR: India's biggest carmaker, Tata Motors, reported a slight fall in fourth-quarter net profit due, in part, to adverse currency moves.\n\nArticle: The first ever UK version of the show is in the middle of its debut season, with the finale on 21 November.\n\nDrag Race features a regular panel of judges made up of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Michelle Visage, BBC chat show host Graham Norton and comedian Alan Carr.\n\nThe second season of the iPlayer show will air next year.\n\n\"I want to thank the BBC and all our fans for their overwhelming support of RuPaul's Drag Race UK,\"Emmy Award-winning host RuPaul said. \n\n\"This season's queens proved that Britain's Got Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent - and I want to see more!\"\n\nThe US version of the show first aired in 2009, has run for 11 seasons and inspired a number of spin-off shows. \n\nSeason one of the UK version, which began airing in October, has attracted 6.5 million requests on iPlayer just over halfway through the series.\n\nCelebrity guest judges on the first season have included actor Andrew Garfield, Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall, singer Cheryl and Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams. \n\nThe show sees drag queen contestants - with names such as Baga Chipz, Sum Ting Wong and Divina De Campo - compete in challenges related to drag queen skills, such as singing, acting and comedy.\nTL;DR: RuPaul's Drag Race UK, the BBC Three drag queen reality competition, has been commissioned for a second series.\n\nArticle: By Alex GatenbyVictoria Derbyshire programme\n\nOne University of Liverpool student was unable to afford the \u00a3200\"tuition fee\", and was locked out of her student account with\"no access\"to emails or documents for her dissertation.\n\nShe said the institution\"had not been accommodating or sympathetic\".\n\nThe university apologised and said it was reviewing its policy.\n\n'Trying my hardest'\n\nOne postgraduate student, Felicity, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she provided evidence from doctors to show the extension was required for medical reasons, meaning it was granted by the university as an\"extenuating circumstance\".\n\n\"I've not extended my studies because I want to have some more time to do my work. It's because I need it,\"she explained.\n\n\"It's the one thing that would have made my life easier, given all the health problems I've got. \n\n\"I'm trying my hardest to finish my work as it is - which has been pretty difficult.\"\n\nThe university's policy states that students face a fee for extending their studies into a new academic year, even if they need the extra time because of personal or medical reasons - also known as extenuating circumstances.\n\nFelicity and fellow student Kayley - who have a range of mental and physical health conditions -  were charged \u00a350 for a three-month extension, which rose to \u00a3200 when they asked to extend further.\n\nFelicity said she felt it could amount to discrimination, as such an extension could be considered\"a reasonable adjustment,\"which has to be implemented under the Equality Act 2010. \n\nThe university said Felicity had\"received a number of short-term coursework extensions as reasonable adjustments\". It said Kayley was not registered as disabled with the university.\n\nIt added:\"In line with university policy, a \u00a350 tuition fee charge is applied for each three-month extension period, which covers access to study services as well as tuition and supervision.\n\n\"We are reviewing this policy.\"\n\nInaccessible rooms\n\nThe programme has also heard of wider issues surrounding disability support at the University of Liverpool.\n\nNana, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, said her requirements were not always met.\n\nShe has been scheduled into inaccessible rooms\"five or six\"times.\n\nAnd she added that when lecture theatres were accessible,\"there tends to be something wrong with the rooms\".\n\nIn one, it was not possible to see the lecturer due to frosted glass.\n\n\"That kind of speaks to how the wider society treats disabled people,\"she said,\"because they hide them away and put them in a corner so you don't have to deal with them.\"\n\nA recent Freedom of Information request revealed that only 57 out of more than 100 buildings at the University of Liverpool were fitted with general use lifts, meaning many are inaccessible for disabled students. \n\nThe University of Liverpool told the BBC:\"We are sorry that Nana has experienced a number of occasions where rooms have not met her needs and sincerely apologise for the use of frosted glass in a designated space for wheelchair users.

He also said he feared Mr Trump would pull out.\n\nWhat has Iran said?\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said the US would face\"historic regret\"if it pulled out.\n\nIn remarks carried live on state television, he said Iran had\"a plan to counter any decision Trump may take and we will confront it\".\n\nBut he also hinted Iran could work out a deal with other signatories, excluding the US.\n\nMr Rouhani said:\"If we can get what we want from a deal without America, then Iran will continue to remain committed to the deal.

Its replacement, designed by architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, was built in the mid-19th Century.\n\nSince last year's fire, discussion over how to restore the spire has been tense. \n\nJean-Louis Georgelin, the army general put in charge of the reconstruction effort, wanted a modern alternative. This idea appeared briefly to have President Macron's backing, when he said he would be in favour of a\"contemporary gesture\".\n\nThis sparked a wave of unconventional proposals from architects around the world - including one design with a rooftop pool, and another with a giant park and greenhouse on the roof.\n\nBut the cathedral's chief architect Philippe Villeneuve spoke out strongly in favour of a faithful restoration to the previous, 19th Century design.\n\nIn one particularly heated exchange last November, Gen Georgelin told Mr Villeneuve to\"shut his mouth\"- causing audible gasps in a meeting of the National Assembly's cultural affairs committee.\nTL;DR: The spire of Notre Dame cathedral, which was destroyed in a fire last April, will be restored according to the original Gothic design.\n\nArticle: Five other people were wounded during the incident at a members-only bar in the city centre, local police say.\n\nThey believe that\"an earlier dispute occurred inside the bar\", which led to the shooting just before 01:30 local time (06:30 GMT). \n\n\"The suspects were armed with handguns and fled the scene,\"Kansas City Kansas Police Department (KCKPD) said.\n\nEarlier, the local police told the BBC that a suspect was a Hispanic man.\n\nAn investigation is continuing.\n\nSo far this year, the US has been hit by more than 40 mass shootings - defined since 2012 as incidents that kill at least three people.\n\nLater on Sunday Kansas City Police released photos of the suspects.\n\nWhat is known about the shooting?\n\nThe KCKPD said in its statement that police officers were despatched\"to the 1000 block of Central Avenue (Tequila KC)\"after receiving first reports of a shooting. \n\nTequila KC refers to a bar in central Kansas City, local media report.\n\n\"Upon arrival, we located a total of nine people that had been shot. Four of the victims were found deceased inside of the business and five were found outside with injuries, all due to gunshots,\"the KCKPD said. \n\nAbout 40 people were inside the bar at the time of the shooting, according to a police estimate.\n\nMore than one gunman may have been involved, and it is possible the perpetrator was at the bar earlier and had returned to carry out the attack, police spokesman Thomas Tomasic said.  \n\nA handgun was used during the incident, he added, and police believe it is unlikely another attack will be carried out by the attacker or attackers.\n\nThe identities of those killed have not yet been released, but the Mexican government said that two of the victims were Mexican citizens. Two are in their mid-20s, one is in their mid-30s and the fourth in their late 50s.\n\nSome of the injured have been released from hospital and the others are in a stable condition, police say.\n\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area straddles the border between the states of Kansas and Missouri, with the main municipality being Kansas City, Missouri.

in a shooting at a bar in Kansas City in the US Midwestern state of Kansas.\n\nArticle: By Julian FowlerSouth West Reporter, BBC News NI\n\nThe boy is charged with five counts of committing an act of a lewd, obscene and disgusting nature and outraging public decency. \n\nHe took five images involving two female teachers at Enniskillen Royal Grammar School in 2015 and 2016.\n\nHe was 14 and 15 years old at the time of the incidents.\n\nThe defendant, who is no longer a pupil at the school, did not appear for the hearing at the youth court sitting in Strabane. \n\nThe fact that the images were taken by the pupil are not in dispute, but the case centres on legal definitions of the offence.\n\n'Trying to shoehorn the facts'\n\nThere is currently no offence of\"upskirting\"in criminal law in Northern Ireland.\n\nDefence barrister Frank O'Donoghue QC said Parliament had recently shown an\"identifiable need that conduct of this type needs to be subject of a statutory offence\".\n\nHowever, he said\"the prosecution is trying to shoehorn the facts of this case into the current unsatisfactory state of the law\".\n\nThe act of a lewd, obscene and disgusting nature must happen in a public place where there is a real possibility members of the public might witness what happens.\n\nProsecution lawyer Michael Chambers argued that\"upskirting\"has on many occasions found to amount to an act to outrage public decency. \n\n'Gross and humiliating'\n\nHe said the motivation for taking an image of this type is\"irrelevant\".\n\nHe described it as a\"gross and humiliating attack on these two ladies carrying out their work\"and said other pupils and members of staff were present. \n\nIf the court ruled that they were not\"members of the general public\", visitors to the school would meet this definition.\n\nThe defence lawyer, Mr O'Donoghue, said\"these teachers have been the victims of an unsavoury act\"and his client now realised that.\n\nThe\"stupidity of his own conduct is now better appreciated\"he added. \n\n\"The victims have been outraged with the invasion of their privacy but that is not the test.\"\n\n'Teenage bravado'\n\nHe said his client was\"a teenage boy engaged in a childish prank to impress his peers\"and it was not an act that would outrage people. \n\n\"Dare say this is not the first time such an event had happened within a school setting,\"Mr O'Donoghue said.\n\n\"We live in a world changed by mobile phones and cameras.\n\n\"But teenage bravado has always been a part of life.\"\n\nHe argued the circumstances of how these images were taken were unknown.\n\n\"We don't know if his fellow pupils knew and laughed, guffawed along with him,\"he said.\n\nHe argued that a school is not a place to which the general public has access and that the prosecution case was not proven. \n\nInitially the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) decided not to prosecute the pupil for the offence of voyeurism.\n\nIt said that the activities reported to them by police as having been committed did not constitute an offence in criminal law.\n\nThe PPS said that the women teachers involved\"were not observed doing a private act and therefore the evidential test in respect of the offence of voyeurism\"was not met.\n\nThe youth court panel reserved judgment and will deliver its ruling next month.\nTL;DR: A teenager who took upskirt images of two teachers at a Fermanagh school committed a \"childish prank\", but not a criminal act, a court has been told.\n\nArticle: The 24-year-old was

porpoises in captivity, except for orcas and bottlenose dolphins already held.\n\nThe association of French zoos complained they had not been consulted on the ban.\n\nBut animal rights activists said it was a\"historic French advance\".\n\nThe ban on captive breeding would eventually lead to the end of\"marine circuses\"in the country, a joint statement from five conservation groups including Sea Shepherd said. \n\nEnvironment Minister Segolene Royal had signed a version of the legislation on Wednesday, but decided to tighten the rules further and ban captive breeding completely after finding out that\"some animals were drugged\"in aquariums, the ministry told the AFP news agency.\n\nJon Kershaw, who heads the Marineland Antibes park in the French Riviera, told local media that government's decision was a\"bombshell\".\n\nThe new rules also ban direct contact between animals and the public, including swimming with dolphins, and require pools holding the animals to be made significantly larger.\n\nEstablishments have six months to comply with some of the rules, and must expand their pools within three years.\nTL;DR: France has banned the breeding in captivity of dolphins and killer whales, in a move hailed by campaigners as a major victory.\n\nArticle: Julia Rawson, 42, from Dudley, was last seen on 12 May, with inquiries leading detectives to believe she is

the President of the Royal Society has told the BBC that the future prosperity of the UK is at stake.\n\nBritish universities, in collaboration with small businesses, receive \u00a3850m in research grants each year from the European Union. \n\nSince the vote to leave the European Union there have been reports that British applicants for grants are already losing out. \n\n'Frozen out'\n\nDr Nick Wright is one of the UK's brightest young astronomers at Keele University in Staffordshire.  A long-standing collaborator recently told him that he was applying for a travel and accommodation grant, which would enable astronomers from research groups across Europe to work together on similar research projects at each other's universities. \n\nBut Dr Wright was told that there were concerns from others involved in the application that a UK institution's involvement in the project would harm its chances - so Dr Wright and his group were asked not to be involved. \n\nHe told BBC News that Brexit was already beginning to hurt.\n\n\"It made me think we were missing out; that potentially they would go ahead without us or even worse they would find our expertise elsewhere in Europe and we would be frozen out of this kind of research in the future,\"Dr Wright said.\n\n\"We are going to start getting frozen out of big projects. Researchers in Europe are looking elsewhere to collaborate and that might mean we are not at the table when big discoveries are made.\"\n\nArcher Technicoat is a small hi-tech company in High Wycombe, which develops bespoke coatings to toughen components. On the day BBC News visited the company, engineers there were testing a new coating for rocket thrusters for the European Space Agency. \n\nThis coating would allow the thrusters to burn at much higher temperatures and hence use more explosive rocket fuel, reducing the cost of future Mars missions.\n\nSince it was founded, the firm has received EU funds from the Horizon 2020 research programme.

That was half-predicted, following the EU leaders' summit.\n\nThe prime minister had set the summit as a deadline (the EU regarded it as an artificial one) by which time a trade deal should be on the table. If not, Mr Johnson had said, he thought there wouldn't be an EU-UK trade deal and\"we should move on\".\n\nA slight unease in Brussels\n\nNo-one I spoke to in EU circles in the lead-up to the summit took that ultimatum too seriously. \n\nInstead they reeled off examples of promises and deadlines the prime minister had made and set and ultimately ignored in the past: walking away from negotiations this June if sufficient progress hadn't been made, dying in a ditch last year rather than extend Brexit divorce talks and more.\n\nBut I detected a slight unease in Brussels too.\n\n\"You never know with Boris Johnson. Might he do something radical? Something unexpected? I mean just look at the Internal Market Bill!\"mused one Brussels contact on the eve of the summit.\n\nThe government's Internal Market Bill published last month has provisions (the cabinet call them a safety net) to override parts of the divorce agreement pertaining to Northern Ireland - which was agreed and signed off by the EU and Mr Johnson last year. The EU was taken aback by the bill and started legal proceedings.\n\nYet on Friday, when the prime minister insisted there was no point carrying on with negotiations unless the EU fundamentally changed its position, there was a widespread assumption in Brussels and in parts of the UK that this was political posturing.\n\nYes, the government had clear frustrations with the EU in its approach to talks.\n\nYes, the EU was impatient with the UK because of a range of issues that came up in negotiations. \n\nBut - the theory went - the end stage of negotiations would naturally be when both sides would publicly flex their muscles most of all. \n\nTo show domestic audiences back home that they would fight their corner to the end... just before they agreed a compromise deal behind closed doors in the coming weeks.\n\nWe saw France's Emmanuel Macron sweep into the EU summit last week sounding intentionally hardline about fish. \n\nEU leaders' written summit conclusions pointedly put the onus on the UK to make the compromises necessary to make a deal. And the prime minister responded that the EU had effectively ended negotiations, unless it changed its position.\n\nMost commentators assumed talks would resume late this week after some diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing.\n\nAnd bang on cue on Monday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier offered to intensify talks (a big UK complaint has been that the EU hasn't complied with a promise to truly speed up talks this autumn). \n\nHe also spoke about getting to work on\"legal texts\". Again, this was an overture to the UK, which has long grumbled that Brussels refused to start work on a joint legal text, despite the majority of the EU-UK deal already being agreed.\n\nBut instead of welcoming these moves - while maybe playing coy or hard-to-get till the end of the week (as it might have felt it too soon to\"give in\"after declaring talks over, such a short time ago) - Number Ten responded that, although welcome, the EU offer was insufficient. \n\nAgain came the demand for a\"fundamental change of approach from the EU\".\n\nHow fundamental is fundamental?\n\nThis is far tougher to come back from than the bilateral fist-waving last week. The EU has already made its overtures. It's unlikely to go much further unilaterally.\n\nDepending, of course, what the UK means by\"fundamental change of approach\".\n\nIf what the government is after is the EU dropping its insistence on agreed competition rules, or at least common\"principles\"aka the level playing field, then Downing Street must know that's not going to happen - and negotiations are indeed over.\n\nThe UK says it no longer wants to be tied to\"Brussels' rules\"but it's not unusual to agree competition regulations with trade partners. The UK has a state aid agreement in its post-Brexit trade deal with Japan. It's asking for level playing field provisions in a future deal with the US.\n\nIf pushed, the EU may well further water down its demand for what it calls\"fair competition\"rules - if, for example, it feels there is a robust dispute mechanism in place in the trade deal, that allows either side to take swift legal action, if they believe the other has broken their agreement. \n\nBrussels has already budged on some of its competition demands, by the way, but it will never drop the ask altogether.\n\nProtecting the single market is more important to the EU (and for German car manufacturers, as they've told us) than a trade deal with the UK.\n\nAnd the EU does feel it must protect its market and businesses from potential\"unfair competition\"from post-Brexit UK.\n\nBut, if what the government wants is the EU admitting that it, too, must make compromises to reach a deal, not the UK alone, in order to return to the negotiating table, then that is certainly doable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said as much last week.\n\nBack to the table at some point\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who has in the past also spoken of bilateral compromise, could call Boris Johnson over the coming days.\n\nMr Barnier has long been pushing coastal member states to allow him to start discussing compromises on fish. Months ago, he openly admitted that the EU's demand to keep pretty much the same fishing quotas in UK waters after Brexit as before was a\"maximalist position\".\n\nThe EU's negotiating team was keenly aware that it would be easier for Downing Street to discuss compromises on competition regulations - which are far more important to the EU as a whole than fish - after it became clear Brussels would give way on fishing quotas.  \n\nBut coastal nations like Spain and the Netherlands - and especially France - insisted that they'd only start talking about quota compromises once the UK\"seriously engaged\"in discussions on the level playing field.\n\nMost importantly, those countries wanted to be seen by the fishermen and fisherwomen at home to have been fighting hard for their industry in trade negotiations with the UK. \n\nThat they would have to compromise in the end is an open EU secret.\n\nBets are now on amongst Brexit commentators over whether EU-UK talks will resume, come the end of the week, or next week at the latest, or whether we're indeed heading for no-deal. \n\nIn the knowledge that, as economically significant neighbours and trading partners, the EU and UK will end up back around a negotiating table at some point, whatever happens next.\nTL;DR: After months of wrangling and shadow-boxing, posturing and incomprehension of the bottom-line priorities of the other side - are the negotiations truly over?\n\nArticle: Other items include the Jules Rimet Trophy and Pele's training kit. \n\nDr Kevin Moore, from the museum, said England's victory was about\"far more than simply football\".\n\nCurator Andy Pearce said:\"We have really uncovered some fascinating stories.\"\n\nShirts worn by Roger Hunt and hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst are being displayed along with boots worn by Hurst, skipper Bobby Moore and West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and Uwe Seeler from the final, in which England beat the Germans 4-2.\n\nWinning eleven\n\nPhotographs, memories and memorabilia from people including a ball boy to a photographer have also been documented and collected.\n\nThe museum has also unveiled its new Walk of Fame of 25 of the game's best players according to a online poll, including England's World Cup winning eleven.\n\nThe exhibition runs until April and will be partly displayed at Wembley next month.\nTL;DR: Memorabilia from the 1966 World Cup including shirts and boots worn by the England team have gone on show at an exhibition at The National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\nArticle: Jose Goncalves, from Our Taste of Portugal in Worcester, said he may have misunderstood the English sense of humour and he had been\"surprised\"at the reaction. \n\nA centre for sexual assault victims said it was\"disgusted\".\n\nRonaldo has denied assaulting Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.\n\nLydia Johnson, a referral co-ordinator at The Glade, a sexual assault referral centre in Worcestershire, said it was never OK to make a joke about rape or sexual assault.\n\n\"I couldn't really believe it when I saw it on Facebook, I was disgusted to hear about it,\"she said. \n\n\"There's really no circumstance when it's ever going to be OK... it's disappointing and infuriating really to think anybody would think it was a good idea.\"\n\nMr Goncalves apologised for selling the biscuits:\"It was not my intention or my business's intention to make something feel really bad for everyone.\"\n\nIn an earlier BBC interview, prior to his apology, the cafe owner said he had sold between 60 and 70 on Monday morning.\n\nMr Goncalves said most people who came into the cafe\"thought it was really funny so they bought them to take to their friends and family\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\"They even told me it was a brilliant idea to do something different,\"he added. \n\nHowever, the cafe has been widely criticised on social media. \n\nTracy Shenton wrote on BBC Hereford and Worcester's Facebook page:\"Don't see anything about rape being funny myself, very weird sense of humour.\"\n\nAnd Heather Whitehurst said:\"I cannot believe anyone would find these biscuits funny.

There are restrictions which are unnecessary.\n\n\"We keep getting told it's based on data rather than dates, but when they don't have the data they still pick on our industry.\n\n\"The hospitality industry is happy to stick to the data - but unfortunately the Scottish government is not.\"\n\nUp to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals under the new plans.\n\nHowever, Duncan McConchie of the Wedding Industry Alliance said a continued ban on alcohol sales would\"turn venue owners into police\".\n\nHe said:\"People will drink, but they will go to their cars and drink. They will go to the toilets and drink.\n\n\"Whereas, if we are allowed to sell alcohol, we are then in charge of the alcohol that those guests consume.\"\n\nMr McConchie said the industry was\"broadly accepting and happy\"with Tuesday's announcements,\"but the devil is in the detail that comes back to bite us\".\n\nJulia Eeeles, who owns The One Lounge hairdressing and beauty salon in Glasgow, said partial reopening without allowing for beauty treatments would leave her worse off.\n\n\"The problem for me - and I think there will be a lot of beauty salons like this - is that I've got two hairdressers but 10 other members of staff.\n\n\"So I am actually under financial strain having to open up just for two people.\n\n\"It means I have to run the salon, run reception and use all my gas and electricity. It doesn't help me as a business owner.\"\n\nPriority groups\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that the\"stay at home\"lockdown order will be lifted from 5 April.\n\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\n\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\n\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including\"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\"- by mid-April.\n\nShe said this would\"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\n\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date.\n\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like\"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\"- would involve\"plucking it out of thin air\".\nTL;DR: The hospitality industry is being \"scapegoated\" by the government as it moves to ease lockdown restrictions, business owners have said.\n\nArticle: A thief took the painted cast iron eagle from the 72ft (22m) pole in Madingley in 1992, leaving only its talons still attached.\n\nOn Thursday it was found at the front gate.

Newcastle saw the lowest rate of just under 200 cases per 100,000.\n\nHartlepool again saw the highest proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus in the last week. Of those taking lab-based tests, about 24% had at least one positive result. More than 5% positivity suggests widespread community transmission of the virus.\n\nSouth Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust had 222 beds filled with coronavirus patients as of 30 December, rising from 202 the previous week and 171 a month ago. Many of these appear to be new admissions.\n\nOverall, there seems to be a real contrast across the North East in terms of the impact of coronavirus, with some areas affected far more than others. It's unclear whether this situation will remain, but cases are rising across the board, with the virus spreading quickly.\n\nThe House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on England's new restrictions on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said they have the support of his party, Ms Lewell-Buck told BBC Radio Newcastle she might vote against them.\n\n\"I'm saying I want the government to put other things in place before I vote for another lockdown because constantly doing the same thing and supporting them is letting them off the hook,\"she said.\n\n\"The prime minister said on Sunday morning schools were perfectly safe to reopen then last night he changed his mind and decided to close them. It's an absolutely shambolic mess.\"\n\nMr Holden said the government moved to impose lockdown and close schools because\"the data is changing all the time\". \n\n\"A few weeks ago I was desperate to see my community come out of tier three, but since then we've seen the new variant of the virus really rip through our communities,\"he said.\n\n\"We've seen hospital numbers surge and we've got to respond.\"\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The same law is being used in San Bernardino. \n\nThe All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here. \n\nNo legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant. \n\nApple v the FBI - a plain English guide\n\nApple's boss hits back at FBI conduct\n\nBill Gates calls for terror data debate\n\nFourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December.\n\nA court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information.\n\nApple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was\"an overreach by the US government\"and risked giving authorities\"the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data\". Last week, the company asked a court to overturn the ruling.\n\nThe same Act from 1789 that was used by the FBI in the San Bernardino request was applied in the Brooklyn case. But Judge James Orenstein said the Act was not applicable in this case, adding that it was not right to impose\"on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will\".\n\nThe US Justice Department said it planned to appeal against the Brooklyn ruling.\nTL;DR: A judge in the United States has ruled that Apple cannot be forced to give the FBI access to a locked iPhone in a case that echoes an ongoing legal battle.\n\nArticle: Three-quarters of the budget, \u00a311bn, goes on pay, and Theresa May told force leaders in London that must change.\n\nMrs May said she wanted officers' pay to be frozen for two years along with that of other public sector workers.\n\nSimon Reed, from the Police Federation, said she\"clearly undervalued\"the work of officers and morale would suffer.\n\nThe government is planning to cut its funding for the police by 20% by 2015.\n\nMrs May's speech comes ahead of the publication of a review of police wages and conditions next week.\n\nThe review, by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, will consider cuts to overtime payments, and housing and travel allowances, and will also suggest changes to shift patterns, and procedures for retirement and redundancy.\n\nPolice'let down'\n\nThe home secretary told the meeting in Westminster the government had identified ways of making savings by cutting bureaucracy and improving the procurement of equipment and other services.  \n\nBut she said:\"There's no question that pay restraint and pay reform must form part of the package.\n\n\"I want to protect police jobs and keep officers on the street, and we can only do that if we reform pay and conditions for all officers.\"\n\nThe government announced last year that it would introduce a two-year pay freeze for all public sector workers earning \u00a321,000 or more.\n\nMrs May said that subject to any recommendations from the police negotiating board, implementation of the freeze in 2011-12 and 2012-13 would save \u00a3350m.\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said the police were being\"let down by a system that has far too many officers in back-office roles\".\n\n\"That's what needs to change, along with some of the working practices that frankly aren't actually modern and up to date,\"he said.\n\n\"We need to make sure that happens so we keep the maximum number of police on the front line in our communities.\"\n\nAnd he added:\"As in so many areas we inherited a police service [that was] completely inefficient, not properly managed by the party opposite.\"\n\nEarlier, the prime minister's official spokesman told reporters:\"If you are going to find savings, pay is a good place to start.\"\n\n'End bonuses'\n\nBut Mr Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said Mrs May's talk of reform was\"a euphemism for cuts\". \n\n\"She clearly undervalues what we do, despite what she says. Words are cheap, but actions speak louder,\"he said. \n\nMr Reed also said the pay freeze would mean\"a considerable sacrifice\"for officers and their families, and accused the home secretary of undermining the Winsor review by making her speech ahead of its publication. \n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had\"put chief constables in an impossible position with a 20% front-loaded cut to their budgets\".\n\n\"This is a desperate and disingenuous attempt to distract people from the fact that whatever reforms are introduced, police forces across the country have already said they are being forced to cut the jobs of around 10,000 police officers,\"she added.  \n\nHowever, Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said officers were\"realistic\"and hoped wage cuts would save jobs.\n\n\"I think most of our staff would obviously understand that bargain,\"he added.\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers has suggested scrapping a host of additional payments and bonuses, as well as reducing the amount of overtime paid for working on public holidays. \n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has also called for an end to all bonuses for police officers.\n\nBut the BBC's home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said there were fears within the Police Federation, which represents officers, that removing additional payments for anti-social or dangerous work could deter high-quality candidates from applying to join the police. \n\nIn 2008, the then Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith rejected a recommended pay increase, but was forced to back down after marches by officers.\n\nLast year, a report by the independent Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said spending on overtime in England and Wales had increased by 90% since 1998 despite a record rise in the number of officers.\n\nThe police overtime bill in 2009 was nearly \u00a3400m.\nTL;DR: Pay cuts for police officers are essential in order to minimise front-line job losses at forces in England and Wales, the home secretary has said.\n\nArticle: Maung Maung Soe is among a host of world figures blacklisted by the US over human rights and corruption allegations.\n\nThe crisis in Myanmar has seen more than 650,000 Rohingya flee for neighbouring Bangladesh since August.\n\nMyanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians.\n\nThe exodus began earlier this year when Myanmar's army launched a counter-insurgency operation in northern Rakhine state after militants attacked police posts and killed members of the security forces.\n\nMany who reached Bangladesh - some with bullet or other wounds - said Burmese troops backed by local Buddhist mobs had burned their villages and attacked and killed civilians.\n\nThe UN has described the military offensive in Rakhine as a\"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\".\n\nIn its statement, the US Treasury said Maung Maung Soe\"oversaw the military operation in Burma's Rakhine State responsible for widespread human rights abuse against Rohingya civilians\".\n\nLast month he was transferred from his post, but Myanmar's Ministry of Defence gave no reason for the move.\n\nThis week, the UN's investigator into human rights in Myanmar was barred from entering the country.\n\nThe government said they barred Yanghee Lee because she was\"not impartial and objective\", but Ms Lee said the decision suggested\"something terribly awful\"was happening in Rakhine.\n\nThe Rohingya people are predominantly Muslim.

away, while others question the suitability of the site.\n\nThe firm has said that people's views will be considered as part of its consultation process.\n\nLast year it unveiled its plans to build a

Presteigne.\n\nThe Grade II-listed premises were built in the 1820s as a court room with offices and living accommodation.\n\nAgents for the applicants claimed the cafe and accommodation would generate income for both the museum and the town.\n\nThe\u00a0neo-classical building is currently an attraction depicting how judges, court staff and prisoners lived in the 19th Century, according to

would be carried out with\"due care and attention\"to the listed building and\"to a very high standard in order to maximise the return\", they said.\n\n\"Market research has indicated that a high-quality holiday let will achieve high occupancy rates and maximise return on the investment,\"the architects added.\n\n\"High occupancy rates also have a knock-on effect on the local economy generating revenue for existing businesses in the locality.\"\n\nPresteigne was the legal centre of the former county of Radnorshire for 400 years, hosting the Court of Assizes, part of the legal circuit which saw judges travel around the country hearing and ruling on cases.\n\nThe building hosted legal proceedings until 1970, after which it fell into disuse with the creation of permanent crown courts.\n\nIn the 1990s Powys County Council transferred the premises to The Judge's Lodging Trust which opened a museum.  \n\nThe local authority is expected to make a decision on the application for listed building work in the coming months.\nTL;DR: The future of a Powys town's landmark building could be secured by the opening of a cafe and holiday lets.\n\nArticle: The long-delayed project has seen its budget almost double to more than \u00a380m.\n\nJapanese architect Kengo Kuma, who designed the building, visited Dundee to mark the construction work getting under way. \n\nIf all goes to schedule in BAM Construction's project, the building will be complete by the end of 2017. The museum could then be open by June 2018.\n\nMr Kuma's vision for the museum on the banks of the Tay was chosen in an international design competition in 2010.\n\nAt that point the project had a budget of \u00a345m, and the museum was to be complete and open to the public in 2014.\n\n'Vision intact'\n\nMr Kuma said the waterfront site was\"very special and complex\", but insisted his vision was intact despite the museum being moved fully onto land to cut costs.\n\nHe said:\"Many reasons have come together to make the cost higher. We tried to find the most reasonable solution for everyone.\n\n\"The vision that we had five years ago is still in the design. It will be a very strong building.\n\n\"We are delighted that our vision for the V&A Dundee building, which was originally inspired by the breathtaking natural setting, is now starting to take physical shape.\"\n\nThe museum is the centrepiece of Dundee's \u00a31bn waterfront regeneration project, and is forecast to attract hundreds of thousands of tourists and millions of pounds in investment to the city.\n\nThe Scottish government has committed \u00a325m to the capital cost of the museum, and Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the government was fully committed to seeing the project through.\n\nShe said:\"It's an ambitious project for the people of Dundee and Scotland, and a landmark building which signifies our confidence in the future.\n\n\"This is a city in transformation.

His latest funds will pay for UKIP's advertising.\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Sykes' backing was a\"significant boost\".\n\nBut Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the party of being\"unpatriotic\", arguing that leaving the EU would damage the UK's prosperity and undermine its position in the world.\n\nMr Sykes, who is estimated to have a fortune of around \u00a3650m, has given no indication of how much he is prepared to donate on this occasion, but said he believed the European elections were\"the one last chance to stop the gradual erosion of our national independence\".  \n\n\"If, as I hope and believe, UKIP score a stunning national victory, then the leaders of the other main parties will have no choice but to abandon their slavish support for the EU,\"he said in a statement. \n\n'Earthquake'\n\n\"Nigel Farage and UKIP are the last best hope for Britain.

I believe terrorism to be wrong and I believe the targeting and killing of innocent people to be wrong.\"\n\nIn a statement, Scotland Yard said:\"The Metropolitan Police Service carried out their investigation strictly in accordance with UK law. This process involved close liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service.

How much it has been paid for test-and-trace work had been a mystery, but these results show \u00a3350m of revenue in the year, which it describes as a material contribution. \n\nThey also provide a reminder of the type of frontline work that most Serco staff do - 90% of them have not been able to work from home during the pandemic. They will each receive a \u00a3100 bonus.\n\nThe test-and-trace scheme has been criticised for poor performance. In October last year, data showed that, in the week to 7 October, NHS Test and Trace had reached only 62.6% of people who had been in contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nLocal public health teams, who conduct contact tracing for the most complex cases, reached 97.7% of identified contacts in the same period.\n\nDividends'fair'\n\nSerco reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3153.3m for 2020, up from \u00a380.7m a year earlier, and restarted its dividend.\n\nMr Soames insisted that work from the pandemic contributed less than 1% of profit, although he conceded that it added \u00a3350m of revenue.\n\nLosses in the transport sector - the company runs Merseyrail and the Caledonian Sleeper service between London and Scotland - and from running closed leisure centres depressed profit, he said.\n\n\"Dividends should normally be paid by companies, dividends after all are what pay people's pensions,\"Mr Soames said.\n\nThe company halted dividends a year ago to shore up its finances, It has now paid back furlough money it received and refinanced its borrowings.\n\n\"On those grounds I think that it is fair that shareholders who over the last five years have come to the rescue of Serco and put \u00a3800m of equity into Secro should be allowed a dividend.\"\nTL;DR: The boss of outsourcing firm, Serco, part of the NHS Test and Trace programme, has defended the scheme.\n\nArticle: The 448-page report says it did not establish the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 US presidential election. \n\nThe inquiry also built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the Republican president, though it stopped short of concluding he committed a crime. \n\nWhile there was no immediate\"smoking gun\"to trigger impeachment proceedings, Democrats said the report had plenty of ammunition to keep up congressional scrutiny of Mr Trump.\n\n'This is the end of my presidency'\n\nThe report details the president's expletive-filled horror as he learned that a special counsel was being appointed in May 2017. \n\nAccording to the Mueller report, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the president about the coming inquiry, he replied:\"Oh my god. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency.\"He added two expletives to describe his situation. \n\nMr Trump added: \"Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\n'Mueller has to go'\n\nThe Mueller report details how in June 2017, the president called White House counsel Donald McGahn at home from Camp David and ordered him to have the special counsel removed. \n\nOn a second call, Mr McGahn said the president stepped up the pressure, saying:\"Call Rod [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel\", and\"Mueller has to go\"and\"Call me back when you do it.\"\n\nMr McGahn was so upset by the interference that he threatened to quit rather than participate in what he predicted would be a Nixon-style\"Saturday Night Massacre\".\n\nAfter media reports in January 2018 revealed Mr Trump's attempts to have Mr Mueller removed, one of the president's lawyers made contact with Mr McGahn, asking him to publicly deny the reports. But McGahn, through his attorney, refused.\n\nNo collusion\n\nThe report found there were a number of contacts between members of Trump's circle and Russia, and the campaign\"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\". \n\nThe Trump team also\"showed interest\"in the Wikileaks release of hacked emails and\"welcomed their potential to damage\"Hillary Clinton. Unpatriotic and immoral, Democrats say. But the Mueller team makes clear it did not amount to a criminal conspiracy.\n\n\"The Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the campaign, invitations for candidate Trump and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to meet in person, invitations for campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking improved US-Russian relations.\n\n\"While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. \n\n\"The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\"\n\nBut no vindication on obstruction\n\nOn potential obstruction of justice, the Mueller report is far from the\"total exoneration\"claimed by Mr Trump during a victory lap last month.\n\nThe report ultimately concludes:\"Unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of justice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference.\"\n\nBut it also pointedly notes: \n\n\"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.\"\n\nWhile the report acknowledges a sitting president cannot be indicted, it also mentions Congress' ability to investigate and potentially impeach him. \n\nIt says:\"Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.\"\n\nHow else Trump tried to influence inquiry\n\nThe report cites 10 instances that were investigated as potential obstruction by Mr Trump.\n\nMost have already been well documented, such as Mr Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nBut the findings also validate past US media reports that were denied at the time by the White House.\n\nWhen Mr Trump learned the media was asking questions about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr, and a Russian lawyer who was said to be promising\"dirt\"on Hillary Clinton, the president crafted a misleading response, says the report:\n\n\"Before the emails became public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with'an individual who [Trump Jr] was told might have information helpful to the campaign' and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions of Russian children.\"\n\nMr Trump also asked former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to announce publicly that the investigation was\"very unfair\"and Mr Trump had done nothing wrong, says the report. \n\nAfter Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving an enraged Mr Trump feeling that he was losing control of the inquiry, the president pressed his attorney general that if he would only\"unrecuse\"himself he would be the\"hero\".\n\nRefusal to'carry out orders'\n\nThe Mueller report found that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to\"carry out orders\", including former FBI Director James Comey, former White House counsel Don McGahn and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowksi.\n\nIn one unflattering passage, the document says: \n\n\"The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed.\"\n\n'Inadequate written answers'\n\nClose followers of the Mueller saga may recall that in January 2018 at the White House, President Trump told reporters that he was\"looking forward\"to sitting down for an interview with Mr Mueller, that he would\"love to do that as soon as possible\", and boasted he would do so under oath. \n\nBut in the event, the report notes,\"after more than a year of discussion, the President declined to be interviewed\". \n\nHe agreed to submit written answers to the special counsel's questions to Russia-related matters, but declined to\"provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during his transition\", the report notes. \n\nThe Mueller report states:\"Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to subpoena for his testimony. We viewed his written answers to be inadequate.\"\n\nBut the Mueller team said they ultimately decided not to subpoena Mr Trump because of the likelihood of litigation would cause a substantial delay at a late stage in the inquiry.\n\nWhy Sessions, Trump Jr and Kushner weren't prosecuted\n\nThe Mueller team did not indict then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for perjury to Congress when he wrongly testified that he had no contact with Russians during the campaign because of the inexact wording of the questions, according to the report. \n\n\"The evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to Russia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions,\"the report says.  \n\nIt also makes clear Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and other campaign staff were on legally thin ice with their June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer. \n\nThe Mueller team says they declined to prosecute the president's eldest son and son-in-law for campaign finance violations because they couldn't prove they had\"wilfully\"violated the law.\nTL;DR: Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation paints a decidedly mixed picture of President Donald Trump's conduct, that provides ample fodder for either side of the political divide.\n\nArticle: By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online\n\nThe error means doctors who sectioned patients in England did not have the right jurisdiction to do so.\n\nMr Hunt insists all were qualified to make the clinical decisions and none of the patients was wrongly detained. \n\nHe has ordered an independent review. \n\nMr Hunt said:\"We believe that all the proper clinical processes were gone through when these patients were detained. They were detained by medically qualified doctors. We believe that no one is in hospital who shouldn't be and no patients have suffered because of this.\n\n\"But for the avoidance of any remaining doubt, and in the interests of the safety of patients themselves, as well as the potential concerns of their families and the staff who care for them, we are introducing emergency legislation to clarify the position.\"\n\nThe error\n\nA patient can be sectioned if they are perceived to be a threat to themselves or other people. \n\nGenerally, a patient can only be sectioned if two doctors and a mental health professional believe it is necessary.\n\nDoctors who assess patients, and make recommendations under the Mental Health Act, are required to be'approved' to do so by the Secretary of State.  \n\nSince 2002, the Secretary of State has delegated that approval function to Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs).  \n\nHowever, four out of the 10 SHAs in England asked mental health trusts to carry out the validation and approval process for them, but did not ask for it to be referred back to them for final confirmation.\n\nThis is the error that Mr Hunt says needs rectifying as a matter of urgency. \n\nHe said up to 2,000 doctors working for the four SHAs - North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands and East Midlands - did not have the right approval to section patients sent to hospitals that included Ashworth and Rampton Secure Hospital.\n\nThe Department of Health has asked Dr Geoffrey Harris, chairman of NHS South and former chairman of Buckinghamshire Mental Health Trust to undertake an independent review to look at how this responsibility was delegated by these four SHAs; and, more broadly, the governance and assurance processes that all SHAs use for delegating any responsibilities.\n\nHe will report back to the Secretary of State by the end of the year.\n\nAll doctors involved have now been approved under the correct processes. \n\nPaul Jenkins, Chief Executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said:\"All of us need to know that if we were ever ill enough to be sectioned, we would be treated according to the proper processes. \n\n\"At this stage, we have no reason to think that anyone has been detained who should not have been, even though the correct procedures have not been followed. \n\n\"We believe that the Department of Health and Strategic Health Authorities are taking swift action and we will continue to monitor the situation.\"\n\nPaul Farmer, Chief Executive of the mental health charity Mind, said:\"We welcome the independent review announced by the Secretary of State and look forward to working with the review team and the government to establish exactly what has happened and why.\"\nTL;DR: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says urgent retrospective legislation is needed to correct a \"technical error\" affecting up to 5,000 patients sectioned under the Mental Health Act since 2002.\n\nArticle: Christopher Taylor, 25, brandished a machete and threatened a victim to hand over his bank card in Brickhouse Lane, Tipton, last November.\n\nTaylor was jailed for seven years after his conviction for theft and robbery offences.\n\nWest Midlands Police said\"there was nothing lady-like about his actions\".\n\nPolice said he wore the locks when he forced a man to hand over his bank card before withdrawing \u00a3200.\n\nWomen's clothing\n\nHe fled in a Peugeot 206, which was discovered by officers around an hour later in Hallens Road, Wednesbury.\n\nAn assortment of women's clothing was found inside and officers were able to forensically link Taylor through the wig he left behind, police said.\n\nPolice said Taylor had stolen \u00a3250 from a woman during a cashpoint theft in the same street two days previously.\n\nHe was linked to another knifepoint robbery in which a woman had her handbag stolen while with her 11-year-old son, and he also threatened a man by putting a broken glass bottle to his throat.\n\nTaylor, of Tadmore Close, Bilston, was convicted of theft, two robberies, having a bladed article and affray following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.\n\nDet Con Jason Fowler, of West Midlands CID, said:\"He and his alter ego face a lengthy period behind bars.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nHome -

The researchers set the birds the tasks both in a quiet setting and while a recording of road traffic was played. \n\n\"Just hearing a car drive by is enough to really affect their performance,\"explained Prof Templeton.  \n\nThe tasks were designed to mimic problem-solving and foraging (finding and gathering food) in the wild. One involved retrieving food from beneath leaf-like\"lids\"that the birds had to flip over to reveal the reward. \n\nIn another test, the birds had to work out the way into a cylinder that had a piece of food inside.\n\n\"They're almost twice as likely to do [the foraging tasks] correctly if they don't hear traffic noise,\"explained Prof Templeton. \n\n\"I think these results are going to be pretty widely applicable to other species,\"he continued.\"While the zebra finches might live in a lab, it's anything but quiet. You can imagine a colony of a whole bunch of birds making sounds all the time - it's pretty noisy.\"\n\nThere is mounting evidence that human-made noise has a variety of negative effects on wildlife. \n\nOne study found that birds have actually changed their songs during the relatively quiet period of lockdown. And even in the deep ocean, the noise of sonar, seismic surveys and shipping can disrupt animal communication. \n\nIn another study published this week, researchers demonstrated the impact of traffic noise on crickets; the sound of road vehicles impairs the insects' ability to differentiate between potential mates based on their courtship songs.\n\nDr Adam Bent, a zoologist from the University of Cambridge, told BBC News:\"This is causing a massive disruption to mate choice systems that have been in place for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n\"That affects how a species will evolve, develop and adapt over time. \n\nDr Sophie Mowles from Anglia Ruskin University,  in Cambridgeshire, added that humans were\"continually changing the characteristics of environments, including through the production of anthropogenic noise\". And protecting natural environments from that noise, say scientists, will be a challenge. \n\n\"It's quite sad,\"said Prof Templeton.\"It's getting really, really difficult to find totally quiet environments not touched by human noise.\n\n\"But we can change road surfaces, think about redesigning a vehicle's tyres. I think there's great scope for trying to reduce noise - we just have to be clever with our engineering.\"\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\n\nHear more about how noise pollution is impacting the natural world on the  Inside Science podcast on BBC Sounds\nTL;DR: A test of songbirds' problem-solving skills has revealed how traffic noise impairs the animals' abilities.\n\nArticle: By Francesca Gillett & George BowdenBBC News\n\n\"I'm not angry, I don't blame anyone,\"says Holly Eyre, 28. \n\nShe has moved back home with her parents in Leeds, after being made redundant from her\"dream job\"of managing a bar and restaurant in Newcastle, where she has lived for the past eight years.\n\nMs Eyre says around half the staff at the independent restaurant have been let go because of the virus.\"Moments after the advice came [to avoid non-essential travel], we started receiving cancellation calls,\"she says.\n\n\"As a brand new member of the team, I'd only been there a couple of weeks,\"she says.\n\nMs Eyre, who is also a trained English teacher, says she is going to change jobs.\"I don't think the hospitality sector will survive the next few months.\"\n\nMs Eyre says the government's plan to pay 80% of wages for staff kept on by employers comes too late.

I want a baby.\"\n\nThe request was posted on Craigslist, a website better known for second-hand goods.\n\nThe potential father needed to be over 5ft 9in, under 40 and prepared to take an STD test. He would also be required to have\"a few days of frequent sex\".\n\nJessica makes no apology for her businesslike approach.\n\n\"Our grandparents didn't spend years and years cohabiting and watching boxsets,\"she says.\n\n\"Starting a family was very much the goal of their endeavour.\"\n\nShe'd also watched many of her friends start families after falling\"madly in love\", only to split up later in a cloud of angry recriminations.\n\n\"I decided I could sacrifice romantic fulfilment as long as my child had two parents who loved and cared for them,\"she says.\n\nShe posted her advert on Craigslist while on a bus from her home in the suburbs into central London - and by the time she arrived at Oxford Street, she already had a number of replies. \n\nShe set up a meeting with the most promising one that very evening. \n\nFind out more\n\nJessica spoke to the Emma Barnett Show on BBC 5 live\n\nYou can listen again here (start at 38 minutes 50 seconds)\n\nA year earlier, Jessica had been in a long-term relationship with David. Like her, he wanted children... but he was in no rush.\n\n\"He was aimless. He wanted to wait until he felt better about his life and his career. You just think,'Come on!'\"Jessica says.\n\nShe had wanted children since she turned 30 and was envious of friends who were starting families. She was also shaken by a visit to her aunt in hospital. Her aunt didn't have children, and Jessica believed she had been ignored by doctors as there had been no-one to insist on better care.\n\n\"I thought there was a risk of me ending up in a similar situation if I had no kids of my own. They can act as insurance for when you get older.\"\n\nShe ended her relationship with David in March 2016 and almost immediately started dating her colleague, Scott. He was keen to have a baby, but after six months of trying they had nothing to show for it. So they went to a GP, who suggested blood tests - and while Jessica's results were clear, Scott's revealed a range of fertility issues.\n\n\"He didn't react well to the news and basically fell apart. I didn't feel I had the ability to support him through it,\"Jessica says.\"Also I didn't really want to go through IVF.\"\n\nThey split up after a make-or-break Christmas holiday in 2016.\n\nJessica then spoke to a gynaecologist, who suggested artificial insemination using donor sperm. Jessica wanted her child to have a caring father, so she wasn't keen on the idea, but she discussed it with a friend anyway.\n\n\"She asked,'Why would you spend \u00a3700 for sperm when you could go down to Yates's [wine bar] and find someone who would gladly give you it for free?'\"Jessica says. \n\n\"But I didn't want to go to a pub and have unprotected sex with someone who'd had no STD checks. I also didn't want to entrap someone into parenthood.\"\n\nHowever, this prompted her to post an advert on a co-parenting website. Scrolling through the potential fathers, she came across quite a few married gay couples, but feared she'd lose out as one among three parents.\n\n\"I was worried a 50-50 split would soon become 70-30 in their favour,\"she says.\n\nShe then started chatting to a single man on the website, until an insurmountable barrier got in the way - Brexit.\n\n\"He voted to leave Europe and I'm very much for remain,\"Jessica says.\"I said,'I'm not really sure we can parent like this.'\"\n\nJessica quit the website, which charged a monthly fee, and considered dating apps. But as a teacher she didn't want to post a photograph of herself. Then she thought about Craigslist.\n\n\"I didn't want to use a dating website or Tinder in case a student saw a picture of me. Plus I knew Craigslist got a lot of traffic and was free to use,\"she says.\n\nShe typed out her advert on the bus to Oxford Street last March, and posted it in the personals section.\n\n\"I don't use turkey basters when cooking and am not using one at conception,\"one line read.\n\n\"God, it sounds completely crazy looking back,\"Jessica says.\n\nShe didn't set many parameters for the potential father of her child, only height, age and sexual health.\n\n\"I just wanted to meet a good person with shared values,\"she says.\n\nShe received a flurry of replies, including the obligatory slew of penis pictures. A number of men wrote claiming they had helped several women, which turned Jessica off.\n\n\"The last thing I needed was for my child to end up at a party and snog their sibling without knowing,\"Jessica says.\n\nAnother young man wrote to say he was desperate for a baby after his previous partner had a miscarriage. Jessica felt he was too vulnerable.\n\nThen she received an email from Ross.\n\n\"He was 33 and also lived in London. He said he'd had some disastrous relationships but he loved being an uncle and wanted children of his own,\"Jessica says.\n\nThey agreed to meet for drinks that evening.\n\n\"I thought he was much better-looking in person than the photo he sent,\"she says.\n\nThey discovered they were of different faiths but agreed they wanted a\"London approach\"to religion.\n\n\"We agreed there was one God who loved pretty much everybody and we would want a child to be comfortable with people of any faith or no faith.\"\n\nJessica and Ross kissed at the end of their first meeting.\"I felt very comfortable around him,\"she says.\n\nA few days later they had dinner and arranged to have STD checks. After their fourth date they decided to have sex, to see if they were physically compatible.\n\n\"It was really good,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"We decided to start trying for a baby, knowing it could take a while.\"\n\nBut within weeks Jessica was holding a positive pregnancy test. She had conceived during her very next cycle.\n\n\"I found out I was pregnant about six weeks after I'd posted the advert,\"Jessica says.\"That was a bit of a surprise. It definitely wasn't what I had expected.\"\n\nThere hadn't even been time for Ross to get a sperm count.\n\nThey didn't have a written contract but agreed they wouldn't sleep with anyone else.\n\n\"I didn't want to label what my relationship with Ross was,\"Jessica says.\"I was delighted I was pregnant but I was wary that might make me think I was in love with him.\"\n\nYou may also like:\n\nWhy don't I want to have sex with the man I love?\n\nHollie McNish: The things new mothers aren't always told\n\nWhy I chose to donate my eggs\n\nRoss was very involved during the pregnancy and accompanied Jessica to hospital appointments. It wasn't all plain sailing, though.\n\nThey clashed about who got to keep the original ultrasound pictures and whether to spend money finding out the sex of the baby early.\n\nHowever, this led Jessica to an unexpected discovery. She had advertised for a father for her baby rather than a partner, but the quarrels made her realise that she actually had feelings for Ross.\n\n\"I realised being angry with him made me sad, as I did love him.\n\n\"But I was concerned that perhaps he was caring and attentive just because I was carrying his baby.\"\n\nThe couple told their parents Jessica was expecting a baby after the pregnancy had lasted 12 weeks, but didn't reveal how they had met.\n\n\"Our families get on well. It may be because there was a child involved but everyone was very accepting and tolerant of each other,\"Jessica says.\n\nJessica had been living alone and Ross moved in two months before their baby was due.\n\nShe had a Caesarean after her baby was found to be in a breech position, and spent a week recovering in hospital.\n\n\"Ross slept on a sleeping bag on the floor next to me the whole time. There was another dad there but he lasted one night before he said it was too uncomfortable and went home.\"\n\nHaving a newborn baby has left Jessica and Ross\"bone-achingly tired\".\n\nHowever, Jessica thinks that if anything their relationship has got stronger.\n\n\"We're coping and getting through it - maybe it's because we don't have the energy to argue!\"\n\nJessica is on maternity leave and Ross can work some days from home. It means they share a lot of the parenting duties.\n\n\"It's great, when there is a particularly icky nappy, being able to hand the baby over to dad and say,'This is yours,'\"Jessica says.\n\nThe couple have now been together just under a year and parents for two months. They are still discovering new things about each other.\n\n\"Like the other day in a text conversation I found out he liked Billie Holiday,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"It's great when we get time together and we always have a meal when he gets back from work. We enjoy being together and it makes it easier raising a child.\"\n\nThey have already discussed having another.\n\nJessica says she is pleased she went down an unconventional route to starting a family.\n\n\"I don't regret the advert,\"she says.\n\n\"I don't think you can get what you want by sitting there patiently and waiting for it to land in your lap.\"\n\nAll names have been changed\n\nClaire Bates is tweeting @batesybates\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\nTL;DR: Ten months ago, thirty-something Jessica was eager to get pregnant.

August usually brings an improvement.\n\nBut the annual trend suggests that the decline in the circulation of Scotland's two main quality newspapers is continuing.\n\nSales gap\n\nThere was better news for Sunday papers though.\n\nThe closure of the News of the World helped the Sunday Mail gain sales. It sold 411,755 copies - 22,000 more than last July. \n\nThe Sunday Post saw its Scottish sales go up on the year from 225,387 to 229,016 although its overall circulation still fell slightly.\n\nThe Sunday Herald, which has recorded disappointing sales figures since its relaunch as a news magazine, also put on sales in July, rising to 32,508. But this was still down by about 7,500 on the year.\n\nThis rise may be due to a special promotional offer which allowed Herald readers to buy the paper at a reduced rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Record sold 275,175 copies a day in Scotland - nearly 40,000 less than its arch rival the Scottish Sun.\n\nThis is the Record's lowest sale north of the border in modern times but the gap with The Sun was wider last July. The Record sold a total of 305,226 copies a day once sales south of the border and overseas are added in.\n\nIn recent months sales of the Record have been largely stable and July's figure suggest that changes to the paper in recent weeks are not having much of an effect on sales, at least so far.\n\nSome 80 jobs at the paper have been cut and some features and stories from outside Scotland are being shared with its sister title the Daily Mirror.\n\nHowever, the company is adamant that claims the Record is on the path to becoming a Scottish edition of the Mirror by stealth are unfounded.\n\nAll the other popular Sunday papers - The Star, The People, the Sunday Mirror, the Sunday Express and the Mail on Sunday - also appeared to make significant gains by attracting former News of the World readers.\nTL;DR: The Scotsman newspaper's sales have slipped below 40,000 for the first time in modern times, according to figures.\n\nArticle: By BBC NewsStaff\n\nUnder the headline\"the day May lost control\", the Daily Telegraph says the prime minister\"suffered humiliation on a historic scale\".\n\nThe Daily Mirror calls the situation\"Mayhem\". It believes\"weak and wobbly May has lost all authority\"and that it's time for her to come up with a Plan B.\n\nHowever, other papers take a dim view of proceedings.\"A recipe for chaos and betrayal\"is how the Daily Mail views the amendment passed by MPs giving Parliament supremacy over ministers in shaping Brexit, in the event the PM's deal is rejected in the Commons.\n\nThe paper accuses MPs of vanity and arrogance, and warns that if Brexit doesn't happen it will shatter trust in the political class. \n\nThe Daily Express says Remainers must not be allowed to defeat Brexit. It argues that it's clear the deal struck by\"our courageous and indefatigable prime minister\"is now the only way to ensure that Brexit is delivered.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nThe Daily Telegraph's columnist, Philip Johnston, compares the clash between the executive and Parliament to the English Civil War. He points across the Channel to the\"gilet jaunes\"movement to demonstrate how a sense of grievance can descend into mob violence. Reversing Brexit, he fears,\"might well unleash forces long dormant in this country\". \n\nMeanwhile, the New Statesman's political correspondent, Patrick Maguire, asks whether rebel MPs have really taken back control of Brexit, and really have the power to prevent no deal.\n\nHe says some Conservatives believe more moderate Brexiteers will now support Theresa May's agreement in next Tuesday's vote, to avoid giving control of the process to those in favour of a softer Brexit, or even handing the decision back to the electorate.\n\nFor those of us struggling with the many ifs and maybes that will determine how events unfold in Parliament over the coming days, the Financial Times has produced a handy flowchart of Brexit scenarios. The paper says that - while many believe Theresa May could suffer a calamitous defeat in the vote on her withdrawal deal - there are pathways that could lead to approval, or else a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAmong multiple possibilities, the paper speculates that the prime minister might go back to Brussels to seek changes to the declaration on the future relationship and then go to the Commons for a second vote; or that Labour and rebel Conservatives might back a second referendum.  \n\n'Psychological torture'\n\nThe PhD student who spent five months in jail in the United Arab Emirates, accused of spying, has given an interview to the Times. Matthew Hedges says he was forced to stand in ankle cuffs for whole days and was interrogated for 15 hours at a time. He says his treatment felt like psychological torture.  \n\nMr Hedges denies espionage and says he was pressured into confessing after aggressive questioning gave him panic attacks. He tells the paper the UAE tried to recruit him as a double agent to steal documents from the Foreign Office. \n\nMeanwhile, the Telegraph reports that Hull University is to review its decision to name a lecture theatre after the Radio 4 Women's Hour presenter Jenni Murray because of her past comments about transgender women.\n\nSix refurbished lecture theatres have been named after prominent female alumnae and were officially unveiled last night. The broadcaster has been criticised for arguing that trans women who have lived as men\"with all the privilege that entails\"have not had the experience of growing up female. She has denied being transphobic.\n\nEmoticon-gregation ;-)\n\nA church in Norfolk has asked parishioners to rate hymns, prayers and sermons during services using a smartphone app, the Times reports. The feedback flashes up on a big screen behind the rector at Aylsham Parish Church.\n\nA recent rendition of\"Shine, Jesus, Shine\"earned 27 hearts and 11 thumbs up emojis, but also four thumbs down. A recital of the Lord's Prayer was given eight hearts and two thumbs up. The Church of England is trying to attract younger worshippers, the paper explains.

Once the home of 12th Century monks, the island is said to offer\"the peace and tranquillity that can be sadly absent from modern life\".\nTL;DR: There are differing approaches to reporting the triple Commons defeat inflicted on Theresa May before she kicked off five days of debate about her Brexit deal. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Jeremy BowenBBC Middle East editor, Tunisia\n\nHe does all the voices. His impersonation of Col Gaddafi, a regular caller, is spookily like the Libyan leader's high decibel rasp. \n\nHe debates one of Tunisia's current controversies, over whether or not to make people work in the afternoons in the summer. Traditionally, they knock off at one. \n\nGood idea, says Wassim's colonel. In the afternoon there will be no Nato, and no International Criminal Court.\"I'll be able to swim in the sea and dance with the people, because they love me, they love me all...\"says the colonel.\n\nOn the show, he argues with Tunisia's former President Ben Ali, who fled in January, about who's most popular.\n\nThere is a lot to satirise in Tunisia at the moment. Revolutions always come with unfulfilled hopes, especially after only six months. But Wassim's corner of the new Tunisia isn't so bad. \n\n\"Of course, yes it's better after Ben Ali\u2026 before I couldn't talk about politics, or about Gaddafi and the president.\"\n\n'Clean revolution'\n\nAfter the show, Wassim admits Tunisians were lucky.\n\n\"We had a clean revolution. The former president turned out to be a coward.  He just ran away.  Not like the others - like the poor Libyans, or in Syria - but it lit the fuse to all the other revolutions.\" \n\nClean perhaps compared to what followed elsewhere, especially in Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria. Overthrowing President Ben Ali still meant a month facing the regime's police, and tear gas, beatings and live bullets. \n\nTunisia's is the most complete of all the Arab revolutions. But many of the people who now can stroll down streets that were battlegrounds during the revolution are disappointed.\n\nBack in January, Tunisia showed the rest of the Arab world that it was possible to remove a leader, despite a police state and despite his powerful Western friends.  \n\nSince then Tunisia has also shown that getting rid of a dictator doesn't solve all a country's problems. Years of corruption and mismanagement leave a very difficult legacy. \n\nTunisia is unstable enough for the army still to guard government buildings in Tunis. Elections have been postponed until October to allow new parties time to get ready. \n\nBut even a successful, free and fair vote won't on its own fix unemployment, which is Tunisia's new biggest problem.  \n\nPeople's hero\n\nMohamed Bouazizi, the young man whose death started the uprising, killed himself after years without a proper job.\n\nHe lived and died in Sidi Bouzid, a medium-sized town about three hours drive from Tunis. Local people started demonstrating after Bouazizi set himself on fire on 17 December.  \n\nGovernment inspectors had confiscated his cart and some boxes of pears. He did not have a licence to be a street trader. None were ever issued. For him, it was the last insult. \n\nLike many young people, he had a pent-up rage inside him after years of without a proper job or real freedom. By the time Bouazizi died a few days into the new year, protests were spreading across the country.  \n\nThe inspectors who confiscated his produce sit in their office in a small whitewashed building with sky blue shutters. The only woman, Feyda Hamdi, slight, middle-aged, with a yellow headscarf, denies the reports that circulated at the time that she had slapped Mohamed Bouazizi.  \n\nShe wept as she remembered how she spent 110 days in prison, unjustly she says, after he became the peoples' hero.  \n\nThe officials in this room were symbols of a repressive regime. But even they agree that a revolution was coming.  The suicide of Bouazizi was, they insist, not their fault and simply a catalyst for what is happening in Tunisia and across the Arab world. \n\n\"The revolution was going to happen in Tunisia,\"Mrs Hamdi said.\"Today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow, it was going to happen, because of the accumulation of frustration.  We don't know when exactly, but we knew it was going to happen. He was just the first spark. It was like a full glass of water, and he was the drop that made it overflow.\"\n\nBoiling point\n\nSidi Bouzid is full of men killing time, still frustrated and angry that they can't earn money for their families.  Elections are due in October, but on their own they won't create jobs. Pavement cafes are packed with men nursing small coffees, or tiny glasses of sweet black tea.\n\n\"I'm in the cafe all day - at noon, at 1, 2, at 5, at 10, 11,\"complained Hisham Laabidi, a 19-year-old who gets occasional work polishing marble. \"I drink 50 coffees a day\u2026 I want to have a job, build my life, be rich, and work.\"\n\nHis brother Mongi, 10 years older, works from time to time in construction.\n\n\"The problem is that I'm afraid that what we're dreaming of won't be realised.  A real revolution should include and change many things, like things in education, health, employment, more justice, more freedom.\"\n\nAt the vegetable market where Mohamed Bouazizi worked, you sense that the men - there are almost no women on the streets - are never far from their boiling point, wanting more change, more quickly.  There's even some nostalgia for the quiet streets that used to be part of being in a police state. \n\nA man wearing a farmer's straw hat against the sun said they wanted to stability and security again. And the man next to him said it didn't matter what had started in Sidi Bouzid. \n\n\"Even if the whole world is set on fire we don't care.  We just want this country to be fixed.\"\n\nThe old Arab world couldn't satisfy the people. They've shown they won't be ignored anymore. So how long will their patience last if the new world doesn't deliver?\nTL;DR: Making a political joke in Tunisia used to be a quick way to get arrested.

with the EU had alienated Leavers and Remainers.\n\nHe warned of a\"catastrophic split\"if his party was not able to unite around a different, more flexible arrangement.\n\nNo 10 said its plan was the\"only one on the table\"able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. \n\nThe cabinet backed the so-called Chequers plan when it met at the PM's country residence in July. \n\nThe agreement, which led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, sets out a blueprint for the future relationship with the EU once the UK leaves in March 2019.\n\nMr Baker is the former chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), which plans to publish its own proposals for Brexit ahead of the Conservative Party conference. \n\nHe told the Press Association that the lack of support for Mrs May's plan, which would involve the UK accepting a common rule book for trade in goods, among Tory MPs left her with a\"massive problem\"in the run-up to next month's Conservative conference.\n\nIf the government tried to push through a Brexit deal through the Commons, on the back of Labour votes, he said the Tory Party\"would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid\".\n\n\"It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative Party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party.\"\n\nMr Baker told the BBC that opposition to Chequers was so widespread that some colleagues who backed remaining in the EU would prefer the UK to leave without a deal than sign up to the current proposal. \n\nDespite his criticism, he insisted he was not seeking a change in leadership and he would back the PM if she changed tack and backed a free trade deal modelled on Canada's arrangements with the EU.\n\n\"We want to change the policy and we would be delighted to unite behind Theresa May with a different policy. \n\n\"The Conservative Party must come together to deliver Brexit behind a policy and the policy we are arguing for is the one the EU has offered us in March.\"\n\n'Suicide vest' row\n\nFormer leader Iain Duncan Smith said the PM's plan was\"unacceptable\"to the majority of Tory MPs and was\"essentially dead\".\n\nAsked when Brexiteers outside of the government would come up with a detailed alternative, he said he and others would be putting forward a\"whole set of new ideas\"in the coming weeks but it was up to ministers to mould them into a plan that would be approved by Parliament. \n\nThe latest interventions follow a week of criticism of the Chequers deal from MPs, notably former foreign secretary Boris Johnson.\n\nHe caused controversy over the weekend with a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a\"suicide vest\"around the UK, with the detonator in

were\"terrified of his popular appeal\". \n\nIn his weekly column in Monday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson wrote that the Conservative government should cut taxes to help\"striving\"families and give the UK a post-Brexit boost. \n\nBut Justice Secretary David Gauke said there was\"no vacancy\"in Downing Street and ex-education secretary Nicky Morgan, who backs a Norway-style association agreement with the EU, said getting a Brexit deal through the Commons would potentially depend on the support of Labour MPs.\n\n\"Surely the public want politicians to work together on this matter of national

is\"strongly opposed\"to aspects of the Chequers plan.\n\nBut with the clock ticking to next month's summit, the Financial Times said EU leaders now seem prepared to begin discussions on the most contentious points of Mrs May's plan.\n\nThe paper reported they would give Mr Barnier the green light to begin talks at a meeting in Salzburg later this month.\n\nBut, at the same time, The Republic of Ireland's EU Commissioner Phil Hogan signalled that further UK compromises would be needed and\"factionalism\"within the Conservative Party could scupper any chance of an agreement.\n\n\"If the UK

She says parents need to know now so they can plan for the new term.\n\nAnd she fears she will have to choose between her families.\n\nShe said:\"Many childminders were open throughout the lockdown to care for key workers' children.\n\n\"We did not have to social distance, kids could be dropped off and we kept using PPE only where we would have before.\n\n\"Now all of a sudden we can't pick up from school because parents can use only one provider and that is nursery or school.\n\n\"So the childminder can't pick them up, and can't have them before school.\"\n\nMs Knox looks after eight children - of those, five are at school, one in nursery and two are under three. She can only look after the toddlers under the rules. \n\nShe added:\"Out of my five children at school, two are siblings of the under threes - so they can mix with brothers and sisters in their home without social distancing. They can all meet after school in a park with as many children as they like under 12, but they can't meet in my setting.\n\n\"And employers will now be thinking they can't let half of their workforce leave at 14:30 to pick children up from school at 15:00.\"\n\nMs Knox says she can't expect parents to pay for a service they are not getting so she - and many other childminders she speaks to - are worried about their businesses.\n\nThe SCMA poll found 58% of participants think restrictions to\"blended\"arrangements - when children move between providers - are having a negative impact.\n\nAbout 70,000 children are looked after by childminders, predominantly from working families, according to the organisation.\n\nGraeme McAlister, SCMA chief executive, said the Scottish government should give an\"unequivocal commitment and statement of intent to remove all restrictions on blended placements before the schools go back\".\n\n'Not justified'\n\nHe argued that, with the virus increasingly suppressed, it should consider the\"economic and social impact of Covid-19 on families and childcare providers, which is becoming more critical by the day\".\n\nHe said:\"SCMA has worked very closely and constructively with the Scottish government and others to contribute to national recovery planning and have supported the cautious and considered approach.\n\n\"Schools will be returning full-time without restrictions on capacity in August and many sectors will be opening more widely over the summer, resulting in wider social mixing.

In July, Governor Duarte accused some journalists of having criminal ties. \n\nHe went on to warn them to\"behave\", arguing that if anything were to happen to them, it would be him who would be\"crucified\". \n\nSome local journalists saw this as a thinly veiled threat against them. \n\nHuman rights investigator Patrick Timmons says that while Veracruz may currently be the most risky place for journalists in Mexico, other states are not immune from violence against the media. \n\n\"We have to understand that what we're seeing in Veracruz has happened in other states and it will happen in other states too,\"he warns.\n\nMexican authorities investigating the multiple murder said they were keeping all lines of investigation open, including robbery. \n\nBut friends and relatives of Mr Espinosa think he was deliberately targeted, pointing to the execution-style nature of the killing.\n\nAll five victims were shot in the head. Mr Espinosa's body showed signs of torture and three of the four women were raped.\n\nSo far, one suspect has been arrested.\n\nInvestigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault.\n\nBut Emily Edmonds-Poli, associate professor of political science at the University of San Diego and author of a paper on violence against journalists in Mexico, is sceptical.\n\n\"That's so old-hat in Mexico, you pick up the nearest criminal and you accuse them of the crime,\"she said. \n\n\"I don't believe anyone is fooled by that,\"she added,\n\nDrugs war or politics?\n\nMany of the journalists killed in Mexico reported on organised crime and drug trafficking, considered inherently risky beats.\n\nBut Prof Edmonds-Poli thinks their killings should not be dismissed that easily.  \n\n\"Many of them have covered corruption beats or politics, they are not necessarily chasing ambulances and trying to report on cartel activities,\"she argues.\n\nShe says that\"it's the nexus between drug-trafficking organisations and the government, and that's why this really isn't solely a drug-related issue\".\n\n\"It's about how the state deals with being exposed,\"she adds.\n\nNo safe haven\n\nThe fact that Mr Espinosa was killed in Mexico City after having fled Veracruz, where he had received death threats, is seen by many as a dark development.\n\nMexico City had for several years been seen as a safe haven, a bubble for journalists.\n\nBut that bubble has now burst.\n\nFree speech group Article 19 argues that Mr Espinosa's murder marks a new level of violence against journalists in Mexico.\n\n\"If you get pursued into Mexico City, that shows another level of determination on the part of people who are interested in silencing journalists,\"said Emily Edmonds-Poli. \n\nRuben Espinosa's murder shows that it is no longer true that in Mexico City\"no pasa nada\".\nTL;DR: \"No pasa nada\" is a saying you often hear in Mexico.\n\nArticle: Charges that Intel had\"illegally stifled competition\"have been resolved, the FTC said.\n\nIntel had been accused of\"a systematic campaign to shut out rivals's competing microchips by cutting off their access to the marketplace\".\n\nIntel is the world's largest chipmaker, making 80% of the microprocessors for the world's personal computers.\n\nThere were no details on any money changing hands as a result of the settlement.\n\n'Renewed competition'\n\nIntel had been accused of bullying computer makers into avoiding rivals' chips. The practice was said to be harmful to consumers.\n\nIt had also been alleged the chip giant had sabotaged rivals' attempts to get their chips to work with Intel's, in what the FTC had said was a deliberate move to\"hamstring\"competitors.\n\nAnnouncing the resolution of its action, the FTC said:\"Intel has agreed to provisions that will open the door to renewed competition and prevent Intel from suppressing competition in the future.\"\n\nThe FTC said its settlement applied to central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs) and chipsets.\n\nThe resolution also prohibits Intel from\"using threats, bundled prices, or other offers to exclude or hamper competition or otherwise unreasonably inhibit the sale of competitive CPUs or GPUs\". \n\nIn addition, the settlement\"prohibits Intel from deceiving computer manufacturers about the performance of non-Intel CPUs or GPUs\". \n\nAt the time when the action was launched, in December 2009, Intel said the FTC's case was\"misguided\". \n\nOther actions\n\nIn November 2009 Intel settled a dispute with US rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nIntel paid AMD $1.25bn (\u00a3m787m) as part of a deal to settle all outstanding legal disputes between the two companies.\n\nThe two firms said the settlement covered all anti-trust litigation and patent disputes.\n\nIn December the New York attorney general also launched a lawsuit against Intel.\n\nIn that case, New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo accused Intel of using\"illegal threats\"to dominate microchip sales.\n\nIntel is also still fighting a record $1.45bn antitrust fine in Europe and a separate case in South Korea.\n\nIn July Intel announced net profit of $2.9bn for the three months to 26 June, against a loss of $398m a year before.\n\nAnd revenue for the period was $10.8bn, as a result of what the company called\"strong corporate demand\".\nTL;DR: US chipmaker Intel has settled an antitrust lawsuit filed against it by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nArticle: Northern removed 168 services last month to try to relieve chaos caused by the timetable's introduction in May.\n\nThe train company said 30 services were cancelled on Monday as of 16:00 BST, with nine due to a signal failure.\n\nBut the Northern Fail app, run by a passenger, said 53 trains were fully or partially cancelled by 10:00. \n\nServices in Manchester, Merseyside and Lancashire partially resumed on Monday while all trains on the Lakes Line in Cumbria are being reinstated by Northern.\n\nThe remaining 25% of its cancelled services will not restart until September.\n\nMeanwhile, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has written to the prime minister asking her to personally intervene over the\"chaos\"caused by Northern this summer.\n\nDowning Street said Theresa May understands the\"anger and frustration\"of rail travellers and believes the continuing delays are unacceptable.\n\nPassengers who encountered delays and cancellations earlier took to social media to highlight their plight.\n\nDavid Jenkins tweeted:\"First train for 2 months and they cancel it two mins after it's meant to arrive.\"\n\nCommuter Dominic Abraham-Newman, from Patricroft in Greater Manchester, said:\"By 7am on the Liverpool to Crewe line, two trains were delayed and one cancelled.\n\n\"It took me triple the time to get to work this morning as trains are also being sent to Manchester Piccadilly instead of Manchester Victoria. \n\n\"Enough is enough, they need to lose their franchise and bring it in-house or give Andy Burnham's team the responsibility to deal with this debacle\". \n\nPaul Boden, who travels from Padgate, Warrington to Manchester Oxford Road each day said his train\"was cancelled without warning\"and the next one was\"chaotic and overcrowded\". \n\nAnd David John Gautrey said:\"The service is exactly the same.\n\n\"Got to newly revamped Lime Street Station to get the 8:45 train to Wavertree Tech Park. Guess what? Train cancelled.\n\n\"Northern Rail suck, it was better when they had bus replacement service.\"\n\nThe Trains.im website, which uses open rail data, reported 18% of services on the TransPennine route were either cancelled or more than 30 minutes late on Monday morning.\n\nOn south TransPennine routes, half of services were either late or cancelled and 40% of services between Preston and Scotland were running late.\n\nOver the summer thousands of passengers have applied for compensation from Northern, which made the first pay-outs last week.\n\nNorthern, which has faced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise, says a\"more gradual\"reintroduction of its timetable will ensure a more stable and reliable service. \n\nNorthern said some of those cancellations have been because of signalling problems which is the responsibility of Network Rail. The firm also blamed\"other infrastructure problems\".\n\nDavid Brown, managing director at Northern said the cancellations since 4 June had been an attempt to alleviate\"significant disruption\"caused by the nationwide introduction of the new timetable in May. \n\nHe said:\"Whilst we are ready to reintroduce all 168 daily services, given the need to drive further improvements across Manchester, we have agreed to a more gradual reintroduction of our services.\"\n\nHe said it had been\"working hard\"to ensure customers\"experience stable and reliable journeys today\".\n\n\"Whilst we have experienced a few local operational issues, as we do every day, so far the vast majority of services are running to plan,\"he said.\n\n\"As at 4pm we have had to cancel 30 services - of around 1,500 we would have operated across our entire network - with nine of these relating to issues with lineside equipment.\"\n\nServices reintroduced on Monday:\n\nAt the scene\n\nDave Guest, BBC News at Preston Railway Station\n\nOn Preston station this morning there was some scepticism among delay-weary travellers as to whether Northern has finally sorted things out. \n\nOne frustrated commuter told us her train from Lytham never materialised adding:\"First day of the new timetable and it's out of the window.\"\n\nIndeed the departure boards did show a number of cancellations and delays, though not nearly as many as in previous weeks. \n\nAnother traveller told us hopefully:\"Maybe the recent trouble has just been a blip.\"\n\nMayor Andy Burnham said:\"People could have legitimately expected, when fewer trains were running, that at least the ones that were running would be on time, well they haven't been. The emergency timetable didn't solve anything.\n\n\"And then on Saturday night, nine o'clock an email lands saying Northern will cancel 47 services tomorrow so we can get trains in the right place for Monday morning.\n\n\"Even if trains do run better today it's because there were no services yesterday.\n\n\"Speak to any commuter in the north west of England and they will tell you that Northern services were poor for a long time before the new timetable came in and they haven't got much better in the two months since.\"\n\nAsked if Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should lose his job, Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:\"Yes, ultimately, because he's just not doing enough.\"\n\nLast month, Mr Grayling defended his handling of the saga and announced an inquiry into what went wrong.\n\nRail trouble timeline\n\nA government spokesman said:\"The Rail North Partnership has accepted the rail industry's recommendation to phase in services from Monday when 75% of the Northern train services removed during the interim timetable will be reintroduced.\n\n\"This is in addition to further adjustments to timetables to improve reliability, so that passengers can better plan ahead.\"\n\nHe added that Mr Burnham sits on the board of Transport for the North\"which jointly manages the Northern franchise through the Rail North Partnership\". \n\nIn May, what was billed as the biggest ever overhaul of rail timetables led to significant and widespread rail disruption.\n\nThe timetable change - for Northern as well as Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) lines - was aimed at improving punctuality and boosting capacity, but instead led to a huge number of train services being cancelled or severely delayed.\n\nNorthern and GTR had to remove hundreds of trains in a temporary timetable change to deal with the chaos on the rail network.\n\nServices to be reintroduced in September:\nTL;DR: Services scrapped after a timetable shake-up at Northern rail have begun running again, but passengers have faced more cancellations.\n\nArticle: The airline blamed lack of demand for its flights to Aberdeen, Bristol, Cork, Dublin and Leeds Bradford. \n\nIt pulled out of Plymouth Airport in August, transferring passengers via bus to Newquay.\n\nThe firm said it had planned to fly out of Newquay while Plymouth Airport remained open, but flights had not been\"financially viable\".\n\nAll air traffic from Plymouth will cease on 23 December when airport operators, Sutton Harbour Holdings, closes the business.\n\nAir South West's last flight left Newquay at 12:05 BST for Dublin.\n\nEastern International declined to comment on the future of Air South West.\n\nAl Titterington, Newquay Airport's managing director, called it a\"sad day\"for air services to and from Cornwall, but said the airport was asking other airlines to take on Air South West services.\n\nHe added:\"Air South West dominated our domestic route network meaning other carriers were restricted with the services they could offer and the demand for air services that would make them profitable out of Newquay.\n\n\"Since the announcement of the closure of the airline in mid July we have been in discussion with a number of airlines and already have announced replacement services to Manchester (Flybe) and Glasgow (Loganair) and hope to announce new destinations in the coming months for summer 2012.\"\n\nNewquay continues to fly up to three times a day to London Gatwick, up to four times a day to Isles of Scilly and four times a week to Manchester through the winter.\n\nIn the summer it flies to East Midlands, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dusseldorf, as well as charter holidays to Dubrovnik, Lake Garda and Madeira.\nTL;DR: Air South West has made its last flight out of Newquay Airport in Cornwall.\n\nArticle: The girl's mother Natalie Elbrow had appealed for the return of the MacBook which was stolen while she was paying her respects to Daisy last week.\n\nDorset Police said the computer was handed in by a member of the public.

The majority of our patients are being treated in their own homes rather than in a contained setting such as a hospital where it is possible to control access and consistently maintain levels of infection control. \n\n\"Therefore, it may never be possible to identify the exact cause of the outbreak due to the number of factors involved.\"\n\nThe company added it was taking part in an independent investigation into the outbreak.\n\nThe CCG said Provide had been rated as\"outstanding\"by the Care Quality Commission in March and said while patients affected were receiving nursing care in the community it was unable to share any learning from the investigation at this time.\n\nIt said:\"To ensure we mitigated the risk of a wider spread of infection, additional enhanced infection prevention control measures were put in place by Provide and continue to be rigorously applied across the area.\"\n\nAfter the discovery of the outbreak nursing stations were deep cleaned and additional infection prevention measures were out in place, the CCG said.\nTL;DR: The \"most likely cause\" of a bacterial outbreak that has seen 15 people die was district nursing teams, a document obtained by the BBC has revealed.\n\nArticle: The AU's move has been backed by the UN Security Council, which on 19 June urged the two countries to resolve their differences peacefully.\n\nThe tension has been driven by Qatar's move to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from the border.\n\nThe peacekeepers had been in place since 2010 as part of efforts to resolve a dispute over the status of Dumeira Mountain and Dumeira Island, claimed by both Djibouti and Eritrea.\n\nThe tiny Dumeira Island lies just off the coast of the two countries, at the southern end of the Red Sea. It is close to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, an important shipping lane for global commerce.\n\nThe two countries' armed forces clashed on the border in 2008. Both states later accepted Qatar's offer of mediation and the deployment of peacekeepers, though bilateral relations have remained strained.\n\nThe withdrawal of the Qatari peacekeepers appears to be related to the country's current diplomatic dispute with some of its Gulf neighbours, which over recent weeks have imposed a blockade.\n\nWhat happened and why?\n\nOn 16 June, Djibouti accused Eritrea of sending its troops into the disputed territory, following the withdrawal of the Qatari peacekeepers, a move that Doha had confirmed two days earlier, though without giving any reason. \n\nDjibouti Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf accused Eritrea of occupying disputed territory on the border, and said his country wanted a peaceful solution but was ready for conflict if necessary.\n\nBoth Djibouti and Eritrea have sided with Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Qatar.\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nA statement issued by the Eritrean Information Ministry on 17 June made no direct mention of Djibouti's accusations of military activity.\n\n\"The government of Eritrea has so far refrained from issuing any statement, primarily because it is not privy to and has not, to date, obtained any information on the withdrawal from the party concerned: that is the State of Qatar,\"it said.  \n\nEthiopia - by far the Horn of Africa's largest and most powerful country, which shares borders with both Eritrea and Djibouti - says it backs the African Union move to send a fact-finding mission, and has urged the UN to support the initiative.\n\nThe Ethiopian Foreign Ministry on 18 June called on its two neighbours to refrain from\"escalating tensions\"and instead\"resolve differences through peaceful means\".\n\nWhat are the implications for regional security?\n\nAside from the adverse security and humanitarian effects on the two states themselves, any military conflict between Eritrea and Djibouti has the risk of inflaming the much more serious and longer running border row between Eritrea and Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia, which fought a border war with Eritrea in 1998-2000, enjoys good relations with Djibouti.

There are restrictions which are unnecessary.\n\n\"We keep getting told it's based on data rather than dates, but when they don't have the data they still pick on our industry.\n\n\"The hospitality industry is happy to stick to the data - but unfortunately the Scottish government is not.\"\n\nUp to 50 people will be able to attend weddings and funerals under the new plans.\n\nHowever, Duncan McConchie of the Wedding Industry Alliance said a continued ban on alcohol sales would\"turn venue owners into police\".\n\nHe said:\"People will drink, but they will go to their cars and drink. They will go to the toilets and drink.\n\n\"Whereas, if we are allowed to sell alcohol, we are then in charge of the alcohol that those guests consume.\"\n\nMr McConchie said the industry was\"broadly accepting and happy\"with Tuesday's announcements,\"but the devil is in the detail that comes back to bite us\".\n\nJulia Eeeles, who owns The One Lounge hairdressing and beauty salon in Glasgow, said partial reopening without allowing for beauty treatments would leave her worse off.\n\n\"The problem for me - and I think there will be a lot of beauty salons like this - is that I've got two hairdressers but 10 other members of staff.\n\n\"So I am actually under financial strain having to open up just for two people.\n\n\"It means I have to run the salon, run reception and use all my gas and electricity. It doesn't help me as a business owner.\"\n\nPriority groups\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that the\"stay at home\"lockdown order will be lifted from 5 April.\n\nPeople will still have to stay inside their own local authority areas until 26 April, when the travel ban will be lifted within Scotland.\n\nAll children should return to school full-time after the Easter break, which for some will be from 12 April.\n\nThe first minister said the government was on track to hit the target of giving a first dose of vaccine to all priority groups - including\"a significant majority of Scotland's adult population\"- by mid-April.\n\nShe said this would\"give us confidence to ease restrictions much more significantly from 26 April\".\n\nIt is expected that all areas which are under level four restrictions will move down to level three from that date.\n\nOther changes from mid-May could include the return of cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls, along with adult outdoor contact sports and indoor group exercises.\n\nBut Ms Sturgeon said that to come up with precise dates for other changes - like\"normal family gatherings where we can hug our loved ones, sporting events, gigs and nightclubs\"- would involve\"plucking it out of thin air\".\nTL;DR: The hospitality industry is being \"scapegoated\" by the government as it moves to ease lockdown restrictions, business owners have said.\n\nArticle: By Alun JonesBBC Wales Political Unit\n\nThe centre will have an initial budget of \u00a33m over two years from this month.\n\nWellbeing minister Eluned Morgan decided to establish the centre to\"provide a Welsh-specific programme of research, evidence synthesis and knowledge mobilisation\".\n\nBut an opposition Senedd member says resources should be concentrated at a UK level rather than\"duplicating\".\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson told BBC Wales:\"Research is crucial in developing our understanding and treatment of coronavirus.\n\n\"To support rapid access to evidence, the Wales Covid-19 Evidence Centre will fund a Wales-focused programme of research over the coming two years.\n\n\"This will be used to shape our response to the coronavirus pandemic and how it impacts on health and care in Wales.\"\n\nBut Mark Reckless, one of two Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party members in the Senedd, said\"research and evidence on coronavirus is crucial, but we should concentrate resources at a UK level, rather than splitting money among the four nations to duplicate work\".\n\n\"Wales would surely benefit more by being part of a UK coronavirus evidence centre with a budget of, say, \u00a360 million, instead of setting up its own with a budget of just \u00a33 million.\"\n\nAccording to the advertisement for the role of the centre's director,\"what is needed is a responsive and flexible evidence and research capability which can work closely with Welsh Government officials and leaders in the NHS and social care in Wales to bring evidence to bear on decision making effectively.\"\n\nIt adds:\"There is a need both for rapid evidence synthesis to make use of the huge research base that has now developed and for the capacity to undertake some rapid primary research in Wales targeted on specific and localised research issues or needs.\"\n\nWelsh Government ministers receive advice from several sources, including scientific guidance from its Technical Advisory Cell.\n\nIn December, the Welsh Government faced pressure to produce evidence to support tough new restrictions on the hospitality industry to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.\n\nIt published a report by TAC, referring to a paper issued by UK ministers that pulls together some of the information that helps scientists understand where transmission is occurring.\nTL;DR: A Wales Covid-19 Evidence Centre is being established to \"shape\" the Welsh Government's response to the pandemic.\n\nArticle: Gavin HewittEurope editor@BBCGavinHewitton Twitter\n\nThere will be no safety net; Ireland will gradually fund itself from the markets.\"We are confident we are making a clean exit.\"says Finance Minister Michael Noonan.\"We are not junk. We are doing well.\"\n\nSo Ireland will be the first of the bailed-out countries to step free from its economy being overseen by the troika - the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. \n\nThere will be quiet satisfaction in the corridors of Brussels and Berlin. They will grasp the moment as providing evidence that the medicine of bailouts, austerity and reforming labour markets can work. In their frequent praise for Ireland they can scarcely disguise their gratitude. \n\nNation's'shame'\n\nIt is worth recalling the mood in Ireland back in November 2010. The Irish government had rescued reckless banks, taken on their debts, and was struggling to finance itself. Dublin created a\"war room\"to fight off the humiliation of a bailout.  Sunday, 21 November was the reckoning. Ireland accepted an 85bn-euro (\u00a371bn; $117bn) rescue. \n\nWith the bailout came a national shudder, with the Irish Times, in its editorial, borrowing a headline from a poem by WB Yeats and asking\"Was it for this?\"There were many who shared the paper's lament\"the shame of it all\". \n\n\"Having obtained our political independence from Britain to be masters of our own affairs,\"the lament continued,\"we have surrendered our sovereignty to the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund\". The Irish finance minister at the time told the BBC that it felt like\"hell was at the gates\".\n\nThat was just over three years ago, but the shamed Celtic Tiger knuckled down. The government cut nearly 30bn euros in spending and raised taxes. Salaries were squeezed by 20% and benefits even for unemployment and disability were reduced. \n\nThe country, with its low corporate tax rate, became the hi-tech gateway into Europe for companies like Google, Paypal and Facebook. Gradually Ireland returned to growth. It is expected to hit 1.8% next year. Unemployment, although still at 12.5%, is falling.  \n\nSocial problems \n\nVictory, however, has been bought at some cost. \n\nIt is claimed that the poorest have borne the brunt of the cuts. The think-tank Social Justice Ireland claims the poorest 10% have lost a fifth of all their income; that is harsher than for other groups in society. \n\nHomelessness has increased by 20% since 2010. In a major survey, Growing up in Ireland found that 60% of families were experiencing difficulties in making ends meet - double the number from four years before. And 13% are behind with paying utility bills. A very significant number of homeowners are struggling to pay their mortgages. \n\nAnd then there is emigration. The writer Fintan O'Toole once said that\"mass emigration had always been the index of Ireland's failure\". It is back. Last year more than 75,000 left the country. And 200,000 have gone since 2008.  Some moved to the UK, but many headed west to Canada and the US as previous generations had done. \n\nEmigration helped disguise the unemployment. Some have even suggested that the government actually encouraged emigration.\n\nGoing forward there will have to be another round of cuts and it will take decades to pay back the loans. But investors have rediscovered their faith in Ireland. \n\nIt may be that Portugal and eventually Greece will follow Ireland in throwing off the bailout\"straitjacket\". But for Europe two questions follow: will hundreds of thousands of young people across Europe have to look outside the continent for work? And have the years of austerity weakened Social Europe which, previously, had been one of its defining features?\nTL;DR: This weekend marks an important milestone for the eurozone. The Republic of Ireland, the second European country to need bailing out, will leave the programme - exiting financial rehab.\n\nArticle: By Orla GuerinBBC News\n\nBullet holes still pock mark the walls of a side street that leads to a picture-perfect beach in the resort town of Sousse.  \n\nThis is where a lone gunman was shot dead almost two years ago - but only after he had slaughtered 38 tourists, 30 of them British.  \n\nTunisia's tourist sector was another casualty of the attack.

I think that's a position of fear,\"said Governor Eddie Calvo.\n\nMeanwhile Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Pyongyang's actions were\"provocative to the region including Japan as well as to the security of the international community\". \n\n\"We can never tolerate this,\"he added.\n\nDefence Minister Itsunori Onodera told MPs Japan could legally intercept a North Korean missile headed for Guam because such a move would threaten Japan's existence as a nation.\n\nRecent legislation also allows Japan to defend the US and other allies from attack. Previously Japan's position was only to shoot down missiles headed for its own territory.\n\nSouth Korea's military said it was prepared for swift action.\n\n\"If North Korea conducts provocation in defiance of our military's grave warning, it will confront the strong and firm response of our military and the US-South Korea alliance,\"Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said.\n\nThe foreign ministry in Seoul, meanwhile, urged Pyongyang to respond to its recent offer of new dialogue.\n\nChina has urged calm, describing the situation as\"complex and sensitive\".\n\nWhat have the two sides been saying?\n\nNorth Korean state media said President Trump's remarks on Tuesday that the North risked\"fire and fury\"for threatening the US were\"a load of nonsense\".\n\n\"Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,\"it added.\n\nAmid escalating rhetoric, Mr Mattis issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday calling on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme.\n\n\"While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth,\"he said.\n\nMr Trump, who is holidaying in New Jersey, boasted about America's atomic arsenal earlier on Wednesday.\n\nThe tiny but important island of Guam\n\nShould we be worried?\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has sought to reassure Americans that North Korea does not pose an imminent threat.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said the situation had not dramatically changed over the past few days, and that Americans\"should sleep well at night\".\n\nSouth Korea's military says it has not seen any unusual action in the North that might indicate a provocation.\n\nDespite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July.\n\nVarious reports recently have suggested the North has now achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.\n\nBut this remains unconfirmed, and most analysts doubt the country would launch a pre-emptive attack on the US.\nTL;DR: North Korea says a plan that could see it fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam will be ready in a matter of days.\n\nArticle: Amanda Silverman told news agency The Associated Press, that Cruz, 36, wore a John Galliano dress at the ceremony, which only family members attended.\n\nThe couple, both from Spain, appeared together in Woody Allen's film Vicky Cristina Barcelona in 2008.\n\nCruz won a supporting actress Oscar for her role in the romantic comedy.\n\nBardem, 41, was named best supporting actor at the 2007 Academy Awards for his role in the crime thriller No Country for Old Men.\n\nThe couple first acted together in Spanish comedy Jamon Jamon. \n\nThe movie, which won a Silver Lion award at the 1992 Venice Film Festival, also marked Cruz's debut in a feature film.\nTL;DR: Hollywood actors Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem have tied the knot at a friend's house in the Bahamas, Cruz's spokeswoman has confirmed.\n\nArticle: By Jordan DaviesBBC News\n\nThat is the assessment of the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council six months on from floods that devastated the area and left it with an \u00a380m clean-up bill.\n\nA worker in Pontypridd said things had gone\"from bad to worse\"with Covid-19.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it had spent millions on flood repair and defence schemes and had increased its support.\n\nIn February, flooding associated with Storm Dennis overwhelmed defences across Wales, some flood warning systems failed, homes and businesses were inundated and areas that had not seen flooding for many decades were left underwater.\n\nClimate change is the main cause of extreme weather and needs a major response, according to Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council leader Andrew Morgan, who also heads the Welsh Local Government Association and speaks for the group on environmental matters.\n\n\"Clearly climate change is happening - it's here and now - therefore we are going to have to continue the significant investment that's going in, and I think it's probably going to have to be accelerated again in the coming years,\"he said.\n\n'No chance to recover'\n\nDonna Rewbury works in a greengrocers in Pontypridd which was left underwater during the floods.\n\n\"We had a fridge - it was just floating. Every bit of stock we had here was just floating,\"she said.\n\nMs Rewbury said residents and businesses are living in fear of more floods, and many had maintained a stock of sand bags.\n\n\"It's got to be a concern for every business around here. It's happened once, it can happen again.\n\n\"The atmosphere is very tense and uncertain. It's just not nice at the moment.\"\n\nJust as the recovery was getting under way for people and businesses affected by the floods, the coronavirus pandemic happened.\n\n\"We didn't have a chance to recover from the floods and then Covid came along,\"Ms Rewbury explained.\n\n\"It's going from bad to worse. We just don't stand a chance. We don't know whether we are keeping our own jobs because of the situation - it's very sad at the moment.\"\n\n'We thought it would devastate us'\n\nOther businesses recovering from the flooding have been more fortunate that their product is in high demand during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAmanda Jones' cleaning business took a hit when her office in Nantgarw was severely damaged by the floods.\n\n\"We thought it was going to devastate us, especially with Covid coming straight after,\"she said.\n\n\"Within a month of us having the flood, 80% of the sites we serviced were closed down.\n\n\"So obviously it was really worrying because we didn't know whether, in a couple of months time, we wouldn't have any money coming in and we needed time to get our property back to where it needed to be.\"\n\nBut the pandemic has since provided a boost to the business.\n\nMs Jones explained:\"A lot of places are realising cleanliness is more important than the importance they were placing on it before, so for a cleaning company that is good for us.\"\n\n'We need to prepare... and fast'\n\nMr Morgan was clear that to avoid a repeat of February's devastation, urgency was vital.\n\n\"I think realistically we haven't got an awful long time to prepare,\"he said.\n\n\"We have a matter of a few years to first of all try and do something about climate change and try and slow down the change that's happening. \n\n\"But at the same time, we need to prepare for what is already hitting us, and I think we've probably got the next five to ten years where we'll need significant investment\".\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it had\"provided 100% grant funding for all of the flood risk applications brought to us by RCT [council]\"and encouraged all councils to\"apply for further funding to reduce risk and accelerate delivery\".\n\nThe spokesman added it had given councils \u00a33m in\"emergency flood\"cash, and had\"increased our financial and practical support\"for councils and Natural Resources Wales to support communities affected by flooding and\"bring forward new flood schemes\".\n\n\"We have provided full funding to all those local authorities who applied for emergency flood funding, amounting to \u00a33 million.

Deal with me today or that's it.\"\n\nExtra security staff were brought in to the court room when Reece was sentenced two days later.\n\nAn order was made which banned the judge who received the letters from being identified, along with the name of the crown court where he works.\n\nLaura Marshall, prosecuting, explained how Reece was able to write to the judge by abusing legal mail known as\"rule 39 correspondence\", which is not usually checked by prison staff as it may contain privileged information.\n\nHe wrote to the judge in April at his crown court address. The envelope contained four letters. Three of these contained threats and one contained a diagram of a letter bomb.\n\nHe also said he would bury the judge in Epping Forest, where he claimed he had already buried one body and\"never been charged\"for it.\n\n\"Once you've killed before it gets easy,\"he wrote.\n\nIn one of the letters he said he had stabbed a man to death in 1994 and got away with it.\n\nHe also claimed to have given a prisoner class A drugs so that they overdosed and died.\n\nMiss Marshall did not say whether or not these claims were true.\n\nShe said prison staff are allowed to check rule 39 correspondence if it is thought to contain illicit material.  \n\n\"Somewhat surprisingly, given the nature of the defendant's previous convictions, the prison authorities did not feel it necessary to monitor his mail,\"she said.\n\nWhen the judge received the letters he feared Reece may be capable of carrying through his threats, given his previous conviction for attempted murder.\n\n\"I find it very worrying that one day Reece could be released,\"said the judge in his victim impact statement.\n\n\"They [the threats] have made me more conscious there could be many people out there who may feel a sense of grievance towards me.\"\n\nJudge Richardson said all of Reece's correspondence should be checked by prison staff in future, and asked for his sentencing remarks to be sent to the prison.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

She was jailed for 14 years, which was reduced to 12 on appeal.\n\nVictoria later wrote a book about her experiences, called\"Tortured\".\n\nAt Spry's trial, her behaviour was described as\"horrifying\"and\"sadistic\".\n\nShe was arrested when police raided her home in Tewkesbury in February 2005.\n\nFollowing Spry's conviction, Gloucestershire County Council apologised for the\"shortcomings\"in its care system.\n\nVital information which could have alerted social workers to the abuse was not shared by the various bodies involved.\n\nVictoria later worked with social workers to help them spot the signs of abuse. \n\nHer brother, Christopher, said Victoria wanted to be remembered for her mission to help children. \n\nPaying tribute he said:\"The work she was doing with the Gloucestershire Safeguarding Board and social services was because she wanted ours to be the last'horror case' for Gloucestershire.\n\n\"I think her legacy will be the work she was doing to help the next wave of social workers to spot cases like ours earlier on.\"\n\nAn inquest into Victoria's death, which is not being treated as suspicious, is expected to open later this week.\nTL;DR: A woman who was abused by her foster mother in Gloucestershire for nearly 20 years has died.\n\nArticle: By Catherine BurnsBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service said it had seen a\"notable\"increase in complaints about flood insurance over the past two years. \n\nAlthough bad weather has been one cause, another issue was how long it could take to sort out claims. \n\nHowever, the insurance industry said it was geared up to deal with flood claims speedily. \n\n'Dream house'\n\nOver the past weeks, some parts of the UK have witnessed more rain in less than a day than would normally be seen in a month. For many, now is time for the clean-up and to start claiming for any damage on their insurance.\n\nKate Fellick is at the start of that process. Her family moved to a bungalow in Earnley, west Sussex, just two months ago. She said it was their dream house. \n\nAs it is not far from the sea, she knew that flooding was a risk, but neighbours said there had not been any serious damage in 25 years. \n\nThat all changed on Monday. She watched as the rain poured down, and then it started seeping through the floorboards. \n\nSoon the whole house was flooded. Many of the family's belongings have been ruined, from sofas, televisions and beds, to photos, clothes and the children's toys.\n\nMrs Fellick, who said she was heartbroken, now has a lot of questions about what happens next. \n\n\"What are we going to do? What is our family going to do? Where are we going to live? Are we going to get the insurance? Is it going to cover us? There are a lot of things that need to be sorted out,\"she said.\n\nIt is still too early to know how many people have been hit by floods in the last week. When there was major flooding in the UK in 2009, there were 25,000 claims. \n\nThe Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that generally, a flooding claim could amount to an average of \u00a320,000 to \u00a340,000.\n\nMartyn James, from the Financial Ombudsman Service, said:\"We have seen a considerable increase in complaints related to floods, storms and other weather-related problems.\"\n\nThe ombudsman upholds about half of all complaints about buildings insurance. If it thinks a company is taking too long to settle a claim, it can make the insurer pay compensation to the policyholder. \n\nLong process\n\nAnyone at risk of flooding should contact their insurer before a problem emerges, to ensure the correct level of cover is in place.\n\nThose whose homes are already flooded can take steps to speed up the claims process.\n\n\"Speak to your insurer as soon as possible, find out what your rights are, and what you can look out for in the policy,\"Mr James said. \n\n\"It may be that they will put you up in a hotel, or provide expenses for you while your property is being assessed and put back together.\n\n\"But bear in mind that it pays to be realistic. If you are dealing with structural damage to your home, it may take a while to sort out. We find communication is the way forward.\"\n\n\"As long as consumers are aware of what the timescales will mean for them personally, it is usually enough to sort things out. It is when communication breaks down that we have to look at complaints.\"\n\nHuw Evans of the ABI insisted that, on the whole, customers were happy with the way the industry dealt with flood claims. \n\nBut he accepted that companies\"can always do a better job of explaining to people what happens if a flood occurs\". \n\n\"Dealing with flood damage is a very time-consuming process. When people are flooded, their natural human reaction is to want it to be fixed and sorted as soon as possible, for their house to go back to the way it was,\"he said.\n\n\"The problem is, flooded houses need to dry out. It can take months and months before the property can be restored to how it was before. That is why it often takes a long time to finalise a flood claim.\"\nTL;DR: Claims for flood damage should be dealt with by insurers quickly and as clearly as possible, an ombudsman has warned.\n\nArticle: Victoria Ambrose was found guilty of breaking Ontario's distracted driving law.\n\nIn court, Ms Ambrose said she looked at the watch to find out the time.\n\nThis claim was rejected by the judge who said smartwatches were a distraction as much as a\"cellphone taped to someone's wrist\".\n\nTime check\n\nMs Ambrose got a traffic ticket in April after being seen by a police officer from the University of Guelph lingering at a red light at a junction on the campus. \n\nIn court, the police officer said Ms Ambrose did not move off when the light turned green because her attention was fixed on the watch. She only started moving when the officer shone a side light from the police cruiser at her car. \n\nThe officer then pulled Ms Ambrose over and issued the ticket, reported the National Post.\n\nMs Ambrose did not dispute that she had consulted her watch, but said she only looked distracted because the device must be tapped twice to tell the time. \n\nShe also argued that because the watch was worn on her wrist it was subject to an exemption in the Ontario law which covers devices that are\"securely mounted\".\n\nThe presiding Judge rejected this argument, and Ms Ambrose's testimony about how long it took her to check the time.\n\n\"Checking one's timepiece is normally done in a moment, even if it had to be touched to be activated,\"said the Judge, adding that it was clear Ms Ambrose was distracted.\n\nThe Canadian student is not the first to get a ticket for breaking the country's laws governing driver distraction by consulting a smartwatch. In 2015, a Quebec man was fined C$120 and given four points on his licence for using his Apple Watch while driving.\n\nIn 2014, the UK's Department for Transport warned about the dangers of being distracted by a smartwatch while driving.\n\nIt said there would be\"severe penalties\"for anyone who caused an accident because they were looking at their smartwatch.\n\nIt said existing laws designed to deter people from checking gadgets while driving also applied to smartwatches.\nTL;DR: A Canadian student has been fined Canadian $400 (\u00a3230, $310) for looking at her Apple smartwatch while waiting at traffic lights.\n\nArticle: Mr Carlaw sits on a Holyrood committee considering a petition to make the golden eagle Scotland's national bird.\n\nHe suggested the eagle was a symbol of\"imperial power\".\n\nWildlife photographer Gordon Buchanan, who backs the petition, denied any Nazi links.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament's public petitions committee questioned Mr Buchanan and RSPB Scotland's Duncan Orr-Ewing.\n\nMr Carlaw said:\"The golden eagle is the symbol of an empire that once invaded large parts of Scotland, and more recently of another empire that tried to.\n\n\"In the lifetime of many people in this country it was the last thing their relatives saw as they were marched to their deaths.\n\n\"It has been a symbol of imperial power of which Scotland is emphatically not, never has been, and hopefully never will be.\"\n\nMr Carlaw said the robin would be a better national bird, but wondered why another national symbol was needed at all and where such thinking would end.\n\n\"Do we have a national domestic animal, a national wild animal, a national grievance?\"he asked.\n\nLater Mr Buchanan said he doubted\"if the symbol was shown to people in Scotland as the national bird, that anyone would see it as Nazi.\"\n\n'True icon'\n\nThe petition was lodged in December by RSPB Scotland director Stuart Housden.

The number of excess deaths\n\nFirst, there is no international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. And making comparisons is tricky as countries record deaths in different ways. \n\nBut experts say one of the most telling measures is how many extra deaths a country experiences above the number who would have been expected to die. \n\nThis\"excess\"death data captures some potentially unrecorded coronavirus deaths, and other deaths that might be the result of strain on healthcare systems and other indirect effects of the epidemic. \n\nIt can therefore provide a more complete picture of how a country has been affected overall.\n\nMost developed countries publish excess death data, but they do it less frequently than the daily coronavirus death totals they provide.\n\nThe US experienced almost 200,000 excess deaths from the start of the outbreak up to 11 July, according to the latest data available.\n\nThat's an 18% increase on previous years.\n\nAlthough the time periods are different, looking at the latest data from the world's leading industrialised nations, we can see the US has a lower proportion of excess deaths so far than Italy and the UK.\n\nThe UK has been one of the hardest hit countries, with around 26% more deaths than expected in a typical year up to the start of August.\n\nSo on this measure with the data available so far, the US is not the hardest-hit country, but this figure could change. \n\nWhile weekly deaths in the UK and Italy have gone back to expected levels, the US could move up the rankings if it continues to see above-expected numbers of deaths each week. \n\n2. The case fatality rate\n\nAnother measure is the case fatality rate. This is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of those who tested positive for coronavirus, how many have died? \n\nPresident Trump has said:\"Our case fatality rate has continued to decline, and is lower than the European Union, and almost everywhere else in the world.\"\n\nThe US rate is relatively low compared with most major European countries, including the UK, although it isn't the lowest in the world.\n\nBut different countries are testing to find coronavirus cases in different ways, meaning this is a hard comparison to make.\n\nA low case fatality rate could mean that widespread testing identifies lots of mild cases who were unlikely to die in the first place. \n\n3. Death rates per capita\n\nThe US has recorded the most deaths from coronavirus in the world, but it has a larger population than many other countries.\n\nWhen you look at deaths per capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst-hit countries.\n\nThe US has recorded more than 52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - there are a number of countries that have recorded more.\n\nThe US continues to regularly report more than 1,000 new coronavirus deaths a day, which is one of the highest daily death rates per capita in the world, according to the UK-based Our World in Data website which compiles global figures for coronavirus.\n\nHowever, there are important differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making exact comparisons difficult.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: As coronavirus cases continue to rise in the US, there are competing narratives about the impact of the disease.\n\nArticle: By Sean CoughlanBBC News family and education correspondent\n\nThey do not fit any stereotype of what poverty should look like, but these are among the rising numbers of people turning to food banks.\n\nThe UK's biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, gave 1.6 million packs of food supplies in the past year.\n\nThis was more than ever before and a 19% annual increase.\n\nThe food bank in St Matthew's Church in Fulham is one of three sites run by Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank, a charity which feeds about 300 people a week.\n\n'Embarrassed'\n\nIt is in an area of London where million-pound houses are not unusual, only a short walk from the luxury developments of Chelsea Harbour.\n\nThe people coming to the food bank are often\"embarrassed and ashamed, they don't want to be here\", says Daphine Aikens, the charity's chief executive.\n\nBut they are coming in growing numbers, with almost a threefold increase in three years.\n\nEach person will have their own complicated reasons - but the common denominator, she says, is simply running out of cash.\n\n\"They just do not have enough to live on,\"says Mrs Aikens.\n\nThis can be low pay, low benefits, delays to universal credit, interruptions in earnings, illness, unexpected costs, debts, rent arrears, rising utility bills... but in the end, it comes back to a lack of money.\n\n\"The tipping point between coping and not coping can be pretty abrupt,\"says Mrs Aikens.\n\nFinancial tightrope\n\nThese are people living on a financial tightrope, with just about enough to get by each week, with no\"rainy day\"reserves, who can be pushed into serious difficulties by a big bill or a gap in income.\n\nThere are so many stories here. \n\nA pensioner who got a ridiculously big bill, but who paid it rather than make a fuss, and then found himself without anything left. A woman whose financial problems began when trying to escape domestic violence. \n\nA couple whose work did not pay enough. A woman who faced a penalty charge from the NHS and was self-harming.\n\n\"Poverty is very hidden, but it is very real,\"says Mrs Aikens. \n\n'Dignity'\n\nThe Trussell Trust figures show that people on benefits are the most typical recipients, but a significant proportion of three-day food supplies, about 320,000, go to people in work.\n\nMrs Aikens says it is important to welcome people and give them\"dignity\"when they come to the food bank.\n\nThe food has been donated, often through supermarkets, and those collecting it have been referred by other services, such as Citizens Advice, GPs, schools and children's services.\n\nIf there is a risk of such handouts being exploited by scroungers, queuing for a bag of pasta and tinned peaches seems like a fairly low-gain fraud.\n\nThose arriving often bring other problems, including depression and anxiety - and food banks are turning into mini-welfare and advice centres.\n\nSt Matthew's is offering access to psychotherapy sessions, along with consumer and legal advice, holiday clubs for families and training sessions on cooking and budgeting.\n\nBenefits delays?\n\n\"What we are seeing year upon year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. This is not right,\"says the Trussell Trust's chief executive Emma Revie.\n\nThere are now about 2,000 food banks across the UK, with the Trussell Trust accounting for about 1,200 of them. The number of supplies being distributed has risen by 73% over the past five years.\n\nThe trust puts particular blame on the benefits system - in particular delays in payments during the transition to universal credit.\n\nThis is rejected by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which says there is no delay for claimants.\n\n\"It also cannot be claimed that universal credit is driving the overall use of food banks or that benefit changes and delays are driving growth,\"said a DWP spokeswoman.\n\nWhatever the reason, the idea of food banks would once have seemed out of place in the UK, but John Griffiths, a volunteer and trustee at St Matthew's, says without them\"people would be on the streets begging\".\n\nWho really uses food banks?\n\nResearchers from University of Oxford and King's College London tried to identify the typical users of food banks, in a major study a couple of years ago.\n\nThey found the most frequent recipients were single men, lone mothers with children and single women - between them accounting for about two-thirds of all food bank users.\n\nIt was usually people of working age, middle-aged rather than young or old, mostly living in rented accommodation.\n\nAlmost nine in 10 were born in the UK.\n\nThese food bank users were living in\"extreme financial vulnerability\"and might have a life of missing meals, often for days at a time, going without heating and electricity.\n\nAbout five out of six were without a job and depending on benefits - and those in employment were usually in insecure, low-paying work.\nTL;DR: Baked beans, tinned fish and canned fruit are carried out of a church in west London by neatly-dressed people in their 30s and 40s.\n\nArticle: By Clive ColemanBBC News legal correspondent\n\n\"He's got so much charisma, it's dangerous\".  So says Peter Dimond, the pilot who flew Asil Nadir out of the country in 1993, before his trial for the alleged theft of millions of pounds from Polly Peck International (PPI).\n\nAsil Nadir has always been a man of extraordinary drive.  Born in Cyprus in 1941, he started selling newspapers at the age of six. He studied economics at Istanbul University, but says that before graduating circumstances forced his return to Cyprus where he went on to set up a clothing business.\n\nThe 1980s was the get-rich-quick decade, and few got richer, quicker than Asil Nadir. \n\nIn 1980 he bought a \u00a3300,000 stake in a small textile company called Polly Peck. Over a decade he devoured company after company, turning it into a global conglomerate.\n\nThe corporate expansion culminated in 1989 when the man from Del Monte said'yes' to a Nadir bid.\n\nBy 1990 Polly Peck International (PPI) had 200 subsidiaries worldwide. Its activities were vital to the isolated northern Cyprus economy. Back in the UK, PPI was a stock market favourite and a Conservative Party donor, and Nadir was the toast of the City.\n\nThe extraordinary growth of PPI was driven in large part by the tycoon's sheer force of personality and, he told me, his punishing schedule. \n\n\"My working week was certainly six and a half days a week non-stop, and the hours were anything from 14 to 18 hours a day for many years,\"he said.\n\n\"You have to understand people like me. Cyprus was a British colony and from my childhood I always aspired to come to Britain, to have my life in this country. \n\n\"People in developing countries have tremendous ambitions.\"\n\nIsland'hero'\n\nErsin Tatar worked for Polly Peck and is now the minister of finance in the northern Cyprus administration. \n\nHe said Nadir was a hero to many in the isolated Turkish-controlled territory.\n\n\"On the island one of the main problems that we suffer is high unemployment,\"he said.\"With Nadir coming from abroad with a lot of international finance behind him, investing in new industries like citrus, hotels and other industries, it was all very positive outlook.\n\n\"He was a very powerful man, very charismatic. When you went in front of him you just couldn't challenge the guy. I mean he was that powerful. I was in no way able to question him.\"\n\nBut things fell spectacularly apart for Asil Nadir in September 1990 when the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) raided his management offices in Mayfair. \n\nAsil Nadir blames the raid - not his actions - for how Polly Peck's share price began to dive, leading ultimately to the conglomerate's collapse. \n\n\"It was a very public raid with newspapers. As the raid was progressing, my lawyers were on the telephone and said we could be of help to them,\"he said.\n\n\"They [the investigating authorities] create a cloud over you which is very damaging. \n\n\"It can have a devastating effect.\"\n\nThe SFO initially investigated alleged insider trading. That was dropped and the probe began to focus on Nadir's alleged theft of more than \u00a3100m from the company. \n\nSFO battle \n\nBut from the outset, the investigation was dogged by controversy. \n\nThe SFO case was that money had gone missing from London. \n\nAsil Nadir said the evidence showed there had always been equal and balancing payments at the northern Cyprus end of the operation before withdrawals were made in London - and that the SFO had failed to follow the evidence. \n\nSecondly, the SFO had inadvertently taken legally privileged papers belonging to Asil Nadir. \n\nIt emerged that the SFO case controller, Lorna Harris, had not fully briefed the then Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell QC on the issue, and he had inadvertently misled Parliament as a result. \n\nMichael Mates, then a Conservative minister and friend of the businessman, attacked the SFO's handling of the case in an extraordinary speech in the Commons. He quit after it emerged he had bought Asil Nadir a watch inscribed\"Don't let the buggers get you down\".  \n\nEvents culminated in 1993 with a bizarre and arguably unprecedented situation - an investigation into a possible plot involving Asil Nadir to bribe the trial judge, possibly involving the judge himself. \n\nNadir maintains the allegations of a plot were completely invented. It turned out they came from a police informant who never emerged into the light of day - and the probe was dropped.\n\nHowever, in May 1993, as the trial approached, the tycoon claimed that he had lost faith in British justice - and he fled. \n\nHe said:\"The injustice was so unbelievable. It was a dash to save my life having experienced all this pain here.\n\n\"What else could one do because you are seeing so much injustice?\"\n\nPeter Dimond, the pilot who helped him escape, told me how he did it - dashing from London in a car.\n\n\"He left the house quite cleverly, by leaving his manservant at the window wearing one of his coats and generally looking like him,\"he said. \n\n\"He had a little plastic bag with a wig and moustache. He was a very heavy smoker and at one time had two cigarettes, one in each hand.\"\n\nMr Dimond took me to the field in Dorset where he said a plane was waiting all those years ago.\n\n\"We came right up to this gate, left the car where it was, walked straight through. The aeroplane was right in front of us, the engines were turning, the door was opened. I bundled Nadir in and within 35 seconds we were airborne.\"\n\nIn 1998 Mr Dimond was convicted of committing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of justice but he was later cleared on appeal. \n\nNadir eventually reached northern Cyprus, from where he could not be extradited because he was a citizen of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), a country recognised only by Turkey. \n\nI went to the island to meet those who knew him during these years of self-imposed exile. \n\nRauf Denktash, the founder of the TRNC, spoke to me about the affair, before his death earlier this year. \n\nHe recalled the extraordinary atmosphere following PPI's collapse and the pressure he faced to hand the businessman over to the UK - a country that refused to recognise his administration. \n\n\"I was shocked. I said [to the British] under my constitution he has committed no offence here. We can't deport a subject and I can't arrest a man just because you request it, I'm really shocked.\"\n\nBut Nadir eventually returned to the UK in 2010, saying that he wanted to clear his name. \n\n\"I now realise that justice is more important possibly than health and education. Everybody deserves that and I felt that I deserved it. \n\n\"I was innocent in 1990, innocent today. Injustice and the pain it inflicts on a person you can never remove it unless you find some justice and I will continue to do so.\"\n\nDid he steal the missing millions? \n\n\"Absolutely not,\"he insisted.\"It makes you wonder, a man worth hundreds of millions of pounds spending dozens of millions of pounds a year on charity, what motive does he have, for God's sake, to actually steal money? You steal money from an entity that you've created yourself? Absolutely not.\"\n\nMr Denktash told me before his death that he admired Mr Nadir's\"courage\"in returning to face trial in the UK. \n\nBut Mr Tatar is more circumspect. He was named in the trial as one of Nadir's main helpers, organising the transfer of funds illegally out of London. He denies that allegation. \n\n\"He was a man who wanted to succeed in a very short period of time that others couldn't. But obviously his ambition, maybe powerful ego and other charismatic attributes for a man of that kind did get him into some trouble at the end of the day.\"\nTL;DR: Tycoon Asil Nadir has been convicted of stealing \u00a329mfrom his Polly Peck business more than 20 years ago. But what sort of man was he?\n\nArticle: By Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent\n\nIt is the first full year that the Welsh Government-owned Transport for Wales (TfW) has been operating rail services.\n\nThere were around 33.5 million trips on TfW compared with 33.6 million in 2018, the Office of Road and Rail (ORR) said.\n\nRail bosses put the fall down to line closures due to flooding and fewer international rugby games in Cardiff.\n\nJourneys across the Wales and borders franchise dropped by 7.7% for the last quarter of 2019 - October to December - compared with the same period the year before. \n\nIt is the largest drop seen by any train operator in the ORR's regional sector, which grew by 5% overall.\n\nThe recorded number of journeys in 2019 was 33,466,435, down 119,454 from 33,585,899 in 2018. \n\nThe ORR pointed out in its report that there was only one autumn international played in Cardiff in 2019 and four matches in 2018.\n\nIt also highlighted the line between Abergavenny and Hereford was closed for over a week due to flood damage.\n\nBethan Jelfs, customer delivery director for TfW rail services, said:\"These events have directly affected our passenger numbers and explain [our passenger number drop].  \n\n\"As we move forward we expect numbers to continue to grow as they have in previous years as we deliver our \u00a35bn investment plan to transform transport throughout the Wales and borders network.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru shadow minister for transport, Helen Mary Jones AM, disputed the drop in journeys being linked to three fewer rugby internationals. \n\n\"We know that many commuters have turned away from using rail services as they feel no longer able to rely on the service. This is due to delays, cancellations, rolling stock that is not fit for purpose, and overcrowding which means many passengers are simply unable to board overloaded trains.\n\n\"It's time for the minister to step in and start delivering on the promises that he made to the Welsh public back in autumn 2018.\"\nTL;DR: The number of rail journeys taken in Wales dropped in 2019 for the first time in 24 years.\n\nArticle: Consenting sexual activity between men over the age of 21 was only decriminalised in Scotland in 1981. \n\nIt was a further 20 years before the age of consent for gay men was lowered to 16.\n\nThe new law will pardon men convicted of having consensual sex with other men before it was decriminalised.\n\nIt will also enable men to apply to have convictions for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal removed from central criminal conviction records - with the Scottish government saying it expects about 25 men to do so over the next five years. \n\nBut it will not apply to behaviour that is still illegal today - for example rape or having sex with someone under the age of 16. \n\nWhy were gay men prosecuted?\n\nBefore the law changed, men were prosecuted for offences including consensual sexual activity in private, kissing another man in a public place, or just chatting up another man in a public place - which was known as\"importuning\".\n\nSuch behaviour was legal at the time between a man and a woman, and is legal today between two men.\n\nThe Equality Network charity estimates that the total number of these historical convictions in Scotland runs into thousands, and that there are hundreds of men alive today with such convictions on their records.\n\nSex between women was never criminalised in this way in Scotland, and the same rules applied to it as applied for sex between a man and a woman.\n\nThe Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill had received strong cross-party support since being introduced by the Scottish government in November.\n\nAt the time, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered an\"unequivocal apology\"to men who had been\"convicted as criminals, simply for loving another adult\". \n\nShe said:\"Those laws criminalised the act of loving another adult, they deterred people from being honest about their identity to family, friends, neighbours and colleagues.\n\n\"By sending a message from parliament that homosexuality was wrong, they encouraged rather than deterred homophobia and hate.\n\n\"Nothing that this parliament does can erase those injustices, but I do hope this apology, alongside our new legislation, can provide some comfort to those who endured those injustices.\"\n\nWhat will the new law actually do?\n\nThe bill will give an automatic formal pardon to people, both living and dead, who were convicted of historical sexual offences where the conviction was for conduct which is now legal.\n\nHowever, the pardon is a purely symbolic acknowledgement that the laws were discriminatory, and does not reverse the conviction.\n\nAnyone with a historical conviction for same-sex sexual activity that is now legal would have to apply for a formal\"disregard\"in order to prevent the information being included in disclosure checks.\n\nIt would then be up to Scottish ministers to decide, based on the available evidence about the specific case, whether the disregard is granted.\n\nA successful disregard application means the conviction will not appear on any background check carried out by Disclosure Scotland, and the person will be treated as not having committed the offence.\n\nWhat was said in the debate?\n\nMSPs from all parties spoke in favour of the bill, with Justice Secretary Michael Matheson hailing the\"excellent cross party support\"for the legislation.\n\nFellow minister Derek Mackay said the bill would not just seek to right past wrongs, but could help\"set cultural norms\". \n\nHe said MSPs could unite to say that\"it is OK for gay and lesbian couples to walk with their partners down the street and not live in fear of being ridiculed, spat upon or attacked, which unfortunately still happens to this day\".\n\nTory MSP Annie Wells said the bill would seek to address the\"lingering impact discriminatory laws could have on someone's life\", while Labour's Daniel Johnson said it was\"an important step on the road to undoing the wrongs of history and building a more equal society\"\n\nLib Dem Alex Cole-Hamilton said members were striking down\"one of the last remnants of a more prejudiced era\".\n\nThere was not complete consensus in the debate however, with Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie slamming the\"cowardice\"of SNP MSP John Mason and other members for\"quietly assenting\"to the legislation while holding contrary personal beliefs.\n\nMr Mason responded that\"people of many traditional faiths\"had a\"genuinely held belief\"that gay sex was wrong.\n\nWhat is the situation elsewhere in the UK?\n\nAbout 49,000 gay and bisexual men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received posthumous pardons in January last year.\n\nThousands of living men convicted over consensual same-sex relationships were also eligible to apply to have their convictions removed. \n\nIt followed the pardoning in 2013 of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing, who had been convicted of gross indecency.\n\nPrivate homosexual acts between men aged over 21 were decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967.\n\nThe Equality Network says the Scottish legislation does a better job than the equivalent law elsewhere in the UK as it provides an automatic pardon to people who are still alive, and also covers all of the old discriminatory offences.\nTL;DR: Thousands of gay and bisexual men are to be formally pardoned after a new law was passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament.\n\nArticle: The Met Office said Belfast International Airport recorded an\"incredible\"88.2mm of rainfall on Saturday afternoon. \n\nThe figure was more than the average rainfall for the month -

Monitor found concerns over\"faulty tissues tests\"from patients at King's Mill Hospital in Sutton-in-Ashfield.\n\nManagers admitted this meant about half the patients would not have received the most appropriate care.\n\nSeventy-nine women are being recalled with regard to the results of breast tissue biopsies between 2004 and 2010.\n\nTwenty-seven women have been seen by specialists since Friday.\n\n'Increased mortality'\n\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) will also review wider patient care at Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital.\n\nHospital officials have said the fault is due to a technical issue and not medical error.\n\nAll the affected women had already been diagnosed with breast cancer, but there were problems with further tests to see what treatment would be most effective.\n\nA number of women involved in the testing errors between 2004 and 2010 have since died of cancer but it is unclear whether any of these deaths were as a direct result of the problems.\n\nTrust medical director Dr Nabeel Ali said:\"About half the women affected would have been offered different treatment had we known the correct result.\n\n\"Those women would have experienced a 5% increased mortality rate over 10 years from their breast cancer.\"\n\nMonitor has already raised concerns over the financial viability of the trust because of the rising costs of a private finance initiative to rebuild King's Mill Hospital.\n\nIt stepped in and appointed Chris Mellor as interim chairman following the resignation of Tracey Douc\u00e9t as trust

of intervention because we are concerned the trust has failed to get to grips with the scale of the problems it faces.\n\n\"In addition to the trust's financial difficulties, our concern about its leadership has been heightened by the disclosure that some breast cancer patients are to receive an apology from the trust and an urgent review of their treatment after an investigation into faulty pathology test results.\"\n\nHe said the watchdog had stepped in because the trust's financial performance had\"rapidly deteriorated\"after it made a \u00a35.9m loss in the first quarter of 2012 and\"failed to deliver recurrent savings of \u00a310m\"in the past year.\n\nCQC chief executive David Behan said:\"This urgent inspection will allow us to take an in-depth look at the quality and safety of the trust's services that relate to breast cancer screening, pathology and clinical governance.\"\n\nInterim chief executive Dr Mark Goldman said:\"We are extremely sorry this has happened

potatoes?\n\nOr perhaps you have been out and about and someone has inexplicably shouted\"hit or miss\"at you?\n\nThese seemingly unconnected experiences all share one thing in common - they are memes on TikTok, the short-form video app that you may not have heard of if you are over the age of 35.\n\nFor those who use it, it is a big deal and the app is looking to extend its reach to new demographics all the time.\n\nOwned by Chinese internet firm Bytedance, the app was first launched in China in 2016 with the name Douyin and grew to 100 million users in the space of a single year, with a billion views daily. \n\nIt went on to become the most downloaded app in China and Thailand by the start of 2018, and in October was the third most downloaded app globally.\n\nAnd it has not done badly in the West either, with 80 million downloads in the US.\n\nIn 2017, Bytedance purchased Musical.ly - another short video music app with which parents of young children may be familiar - increasing awareness and adding 30 million more users.\n\nIt now has more than half a billion active users, with 40% of those outside China.\n\nVideos created on TikTok are generally no longer than 15 seconds - although it has experimented recently with longer clips and some star users are allowed to make videos of up to 59 seconds. Adverts have also recently been spotted on the site as it looks for ways to monetise its content.\n\nAll the clips are based around themes, such as music, cooking, dance or fashion.\n\nPreviously, Bytedance had focused on news, with an app called Toutiao which used AI algorithms to learn user preferences. The same AI is used to provide relevant videos to TikTok users.\n\nTikTok has a bunch of clever movie studio-style special effects, such as an editing tool that allows people to appear to move objects with their minds.\n\n\"TikTok has tapped into a successful model of user-generated content by making professional-quality video creation simple and accessible,\"said Paul Barnes, managing director of analytics company App Annie.\n\nAnd while it is not the first of its kind - remember Vine? - it has proved far more durable.\n\n\"Vine popularised the short-form video format, but it was much harder to create a quality video. You were really left to your own devices, and needed a high level of technical expertise, along with talent as a performer, to create something people wanted to watch,\"said Mr Barnes.\n\n\"In contrast, the editing features in TikTok and the relatively straightforward nature of lip-syncing means it's easier than ever before to create original video content.\"\n\nTikTok is often applauded for being one of the few happy places on the internet - its silly video clips contrast starkly with some of the darker content on YouTube.\n\nThat may not last, thinks Charlotte McEleny, publisher of marketing magazine The Drum.\n\n\"No user-generated, or mostly user-governed platform, is ever going to be squeaky clean. What it can and should do is learn from those errors made before, as there is a tough balancing for these platforms to make in allowing creativity and self-expression, while also wanting to protect users from inappropriate content.\"\n\nWho uses TikTok?\n\nSophie is 12 (so in theory not old enough to use the app which is officially for 13-year-olds and over) She,  like many youngsters, came to it via Musical.ly, and has parental approval to use TikTok. She says she used it more when it was Musical.ly, but likes the ephemeral nature of its content. \n\n\"You can go on for one minute, the videos are 15 seconds long so you can watch a lot in a short time,\"she said.\n\nMunavar Zeb is 32 and lives in the Indian city of Surat. He has been on TikTok for more than a year and likes to post videos of himself, which he makes on a Sunday, his only day off work.  \n\n\"I think the basic fundamental thing which appeals is that one can act, dance, sing, and do whatever you are good at in front of a camera and upload the same to get liked by the world and ultimately become famous,\"he told the BBC\n\n\"I don't know about everyone but, yes I feel very excited and happy whenever my video is being liked by someone.\"\n\nLaurie Elle is a 20-year-old from Manchester who has more than 2.5 million followers on TikTok, and has been invited to attend some of its offline events.  As a dancer, she uses it primarily to share dance videos. \n\nShe says that she finds the app really easy to use.\"You can film the videos straight from your phone and add effects in the app, you don't need any professional equipment to use TikTok. \n\n\"The trends on the app are also really popular, fun and easy to get involved in so it gives everyone a chance to share their own content and get creative,\"she said.\n\nShe told the BBC that, while the app is largely free of\"negative content\", it is the online space where she personally receives the\"most negative comments and messages\", although TikTok does have the option to disable these.\n\nLove it or hate it, it could soon become hard to avoid, in part because whenever a meme or clip from the app appears on the web, the branding is watermarked on it with people invited to visit the site, a clever piece of marketing that is making its name stand out amid the ton of anonymous web content.\n\nThat, and the fact that it has concentrated on one thing - user-driven video - could mean Bytedance can achieve what bigger, rival  platforms like Tencent and Baidu have not - breaking into the conscience of Western users too.\n\n\"It's interesting that something so single-minded has done that, over the hugely successful WeChat in China. A lot of people looked at WeChat and thought that would be the crossover app,\"said Ms McEleny. \n\n\"While most young Chinese will order, pay and socialise through it constantly, that behaviour hasn't translated as well into Europe and America.\"\n\nTikTok was given a boast in terms of visibility in America, when US talk show host Jimmy Fallon promoted the app and initiated a campaign #TumbleweedChallenge.\n\nIn the challenge, people roll on the ground to music associated with Western movies. \n\nSince November 2018, when Mr Fallon mentioned it on The Tonight Show, more than nine million videos have been tagged #TumbleweedChallenge on the app.\n\nFor TikTok, there seems to be no tumbleweed moment as it sweeps its way through more and more countries, picking up new users at every turn.\nTL;DR: Have you seen the viral video where a choir of gummy bears sing a rousing chorus of Adele's Someone Like You?\n\nArticle: Around 92% of NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) do not provide round-the-clock telephone help lines, the charity said.\n\nGuidelines say there should be 24-hour telephone services and the NHS says it is\"working hard to make changes\".\n\nThere are half a million carers for terminal patients in England.\n\nSupport'gap'\n\nSue Ryder said there is an\"obvious inequality\"between help and advice for the start and the end of life, with 24-hour, seven-day-per-week help available for maternity issues.\n\nThe charity asked all of the 211 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England whether they had commissioned 24-hour end-of-life care support, including help lines staffed by nurses.\n\nOut of 180 CCGs which responded to requests for information from the charity, only 8% said their local area had a dedicated 24-hour help line and palliative care coordination centre.\n\nA poll of 2,048 UK adults conducted by Populus on behalf of Sue Ryder suggested that around four out of five people support the availability of 24-hour advice for those who are dying.\n\nAround the same proportion of people think 24-hour emergency home visits should be available to alleviate pain and other symptoms.\n\nThe Leadership Alliance for the Care of Dying People, a group of government bodies, health experts and charities, published official guidance in June specifying that palliative care should include access to telephone support.\n\n\"Service providers and commissioners are expected to ensure provision for specialist palliative medical and nursing cover routinely 9am to 5pm seven days a week and a 24-hour telephone advice service,\"the guidance said.\n\n'Making changes'\n\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), service providers should ensure that carers and terminally ill should be offered information\"in an accessible and sensitive way, in response to their needs and preferences.\"\n\nCare should be\"coordinated effectively\", the NICE guidelines from 2011 add.\n\nBee Wee, NHS England's national clinical director for end of life care, said:\"Over the past year we have been working hard to make changes and move towards a palliative care service that gives everyone a choice about how and where they spend their final days.\n\n\"It is really important that dying people, and those close to them, have access to care, support and advice whenever they need it, so we support this as an important issue to address.\"\n\n'Terrifying experience'\n\nVictoria Wolfe-Brown, who gave up work to look after her parents, said she had found the provision of palliative care to be\"unco-ordinated and somewhat chaotic\"at times, last year and this.\n\n\"At one point, in the course of a four day period, there were forty care workers in the house, but not one knew anything about my father's condition,\"she said.\n\n\"On another occasion, we were stranded as the usual service we got help from was closed on a bank holiday - my father's condition was going rapidly downhill - it was quite a terrifying experience,\"she added.\n\nSue Ryder chief executive Heidi Travis said:\"People who are dying, their carers and their families should be able to access the care they want, when they want.\n\n\"Unfortunately many areas of the country simply don't have the services in place to make this ambition a reality.\"\n\nDespite concerns from some charities and carers, the UK has some of the best-rated end-of-life care in the world, according to the Worldwide Palliative Care Alliance (WPCA).\n\nThe UK ranks with the Australia, Austria, Norway, and the US as having the best-rated palliative care, while Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco, Mozambique, and Pakistan have some of the worst-rated care.\n\nAround 98 countries around the world have no hospice or palliative care.\nTL;DR: The NHS is failing to provide access to 24-hour support for the majority of patients dying at home in England, according to health charity Sue Ryder.\n\nArticle: Video shown to the court in The Hague showed panicking civilians swamping UN trucks as Bosnian Serb forces neared.\n\nGen Mladic faces 11 charges, including genocide, over the 1992-95 Bosnian war.

stirrers and plastic cotton buds in England from April 2020. \n\nOnly plastic drinks stirrers will be totally banned from sale - currently 316 million are used a year.\n\nEnvironmental groups have praised the move but say the government needs to take far more decisive action.\n\nHow will plastic straws be affected?\n\nThe government press release announcing the new restrictions talks of\"a ban on the supply of plastic straws\"but in reality the aim is instead to restrict their availability.\n\nShops including supermarkets will not be allowed to sell the straws but they will on sale by registered pharmacies in stores and online.\n\nThat's because disabled groups have highlighted how straws are essential for everyday life and that a total ban could lead to the risk of dehydration.\n\nAccording to the announcement, bars and restaurants will not be allowed to display plastic straws or automatically hand them out but they will be able to provide them if people ask.\n\nWhen asked who could request a straw, a spokesperson for the environment ministry Defra said:\"Anyone can ask for a straw and be given one without needing to prove a disability - we've been working with disabled groups so that they don't feel stigmatised.\"\n\nWhat else is covered by the new controls?\n\nPlastic stirrers will be subject to a total ban.\n\nHowever plastic-stemmed cotton buds, although restricted from general sale to the public, will still be available.\n\nMedical and scientific laboratories will be able to buy them for use in research and for forensic tasks in criminal investigations. \n\nDefra reckons 1.8bn plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used and thrown away every year in England. \n\nHaven't we heard this before?\n\nThe government has been considering action on single-use plastic items since the public reaction to David Attenborough's landmark Blue Planet II documentaries nearly two years ago. \n\nAt the time, Environment Secretary Michael Gove described being haunted by the image of marine life harmed by plastic and launched consultations on a series of measures to curb single-use items. \n\nAs part of today's announcement that controls would come into effect next April, Mr Gove said:\"These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.\n\n\"So today I am taking action to turn the tide on plastic pollution, and ensure we leave our environment in a better state for future generations.\"\n\nThis comes as Scotland is also taking steps to restrict or ban plastic straws, and plastic-stemmed cotton buds.\n\nThe Welsh government has also been considering similar measures. \n\nEarlier this week the European Union formally adopted a plan to ban a longer list of items including plastic straws, plastic cutlery and plastic plates by 2021. \n\nGreen groups say they are pleased that the government is taking action but many are critical that the measures do not go further. \n\nWWF called for a ban on all\"avoidable single-use plastic\"by 2025 and said ministers needed\"to really ramp up their commitments\".\n\nThe Marine

remains are said to be well preserved and include the main quay wall, landing stages and wharves.\n\nExcavation leader Dr Peter Guest said the port was a\"major addition to the archaeology of Roman Britain\".\n\nStudents using geophysical equipment, which can reveal outlines of buried structures, came across the remains of a site of large Roman buildings on the banks of the River Usk last year.\n\nThe buildings may have been market places, administrative buildings, bath houses and temples.\n\nThe excavation work, which also led to the discovery of the port, is said to have exceeded all expectations.\n\nDr Guest, senior lecturer in Roman archaeology at Cardiff University, said:\"I think it's very important indeed for Caerleon because it allows us to see Caerleon in its immediate landscape so we now know there's this suburb of the fortress.\n\n\"Caerleon connected upstream with the hillier parts of Wales, and there were Roman forts at Abergavenny and Brecon, but if you go downstream you can go to Roman London but also the Loire Valley, the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean into the heart of the Roman world.\"\n\nHe said it was believed the port dated to a period when the legions were\"fighting and subduing the native tribes in western Britain\".\n\n\"It's incredible to think that this is the place where the men who took part in the conquest would have arrived,\"he added.\n\nThe port is only the second from Roman Britain to be discovered and excavated after London.\n\nDr Mark Lewis, of the National Roman Legion Museum in Caerleon, said everything learned about Caerleon was\"immediately of international significance\".\n\n\"There were three legions permanently based in Britain for most of the Roman period, and for 200 years from AD 74, the Second Augustan Legion was based in Caerleon,\"he said.\n\n\"At any one time in the Roman Empire, there are about 30 legions and one of them was permanently based here.\n\n'Spectacular'\n\n\"It is always incredibly important.\"\n\nHe said the port was on a major scale and the other buildings discovered were\"spectacular\".\n\n\"We've got a good idea of the shape and outline of the buildings,\"he said.\n\n\"What that has shown up is that what Peter is excavating is one of the largest complexes of Roman buildings in Britain. \n\n\"It ranks with some of the largest in Europe.\"\n\nThe dig's progress can be

Empire.\n\nArticle: By Clare SpencerBBC News\n\nSome of Twitter's most significant moments of the last decade - from revolution to revelling - have been felt in Africa:\n\n#Kony2012\n\nA campaign to find Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony, who roams central Africa, used the hastags #Kony2012 and #StopKony.\n\nThey linked to a half-hour film about his Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which is made up of abducted child soldiers.\n\nThe aim of the campaign by US activists was to bring the Ugandan to justice at the International Criminal Court, where he is charged with crimes against humanity.\n\nThe video is widely cited as being the fastest-growing viral video of all time.  \n\nIt reached 100 million views in six days, and 3.7 million people pledged their support for efforts to arrest Mr Kony, says Invisible Children, the organisation behind the video.\n\nThis was partly achieved through celebrity endorsement by people with a lot of followers like the Bajan singer Rihanna:\n\nThe campaign was heavily criticised. One person to ridicule it was English TV critic Charlie Brooker who pointed out at the time:\"Joseph Kony left Uganda six years ago which makes it so out of date that they may as well be campaigning to kick Bubble out of Big Brother Two\".\n\nFour years on, Mr Kony is still at large. The British Telegraph paper reported at the beginning of March that he is believed to be in South Sudan and the LRA Tracker group says more than 200 people in the Central African Republic (CAR) have been abducted by the LRA since January.\n\n#BringBackOurGirls\n\nTweeters used the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to call for Nigeria's government to rescue more than 200 girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from their school in north-eastern town of Chibok in April 2014.\n\nWithin two weeks of the hashtag taking off, it was tweeted more than a million times. \n\nBBC Trending says Nigerian Lawyer Ibrahim M Abdullahi was the very first person to use the hashtag. \n\nAfter a talk by the former Federal Minister of Education Obiageli Ezekwesili he tweeted this:\n\nThe hashtag went on to be used across the world, including a significant tweet by the US First Lady Michelle Obama:\n\nMore than two years on, the girls have yet to be found.\n\n#Jan25\n\nA few popular uprisings have been dubbed\"Twitter revolutions\"- including Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution of 2011.\n\nThe BBC reported that this was a victory over state censorship - won by using proxy servers to get around the government's attempt to block Tunisians from posting about the protests online. \n\nThe president stood down.\n\nThousands of Egyptians joined protests after an internet campaign inspired by the uprising in Tunisia.\n\nOn 25 January 2011 hundreds of thousands of protesters started to gather in Tahrir Square in Egypt's capital, Cairo. \n\nThey used the hastag #Jan25.\n\nBut then Twitter was blocked in Egypt.\n\nThe Twitter company released a statement saying it believed that the open exchange of information and views was a benefit to societies, and helped governments better connect with their people.\n\nThis tweet has been picked out by the company today for marking when Twitter came back online in Egypt:\n\nBeyond 25 January, the hashtag prevailed:\n\nEgypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak stood down and similar protests followed in 10 other countries, in the so-called Arab Spring.\n\n#OccupyNigeria\n\nAt the beginning of 2012 a group of young, well-educated Nigerians organised themselves on Twitter using the hashtag #OccupyNigeria and forced the government to restore some of the fuel subsidy they had withdrawn.\n\nNigerian leaders being held to account surprised some Nigeria-watchers at the time. Rarely had there been anything as unifying as the fuel subsidy protests. \n\nThe then-head of the central bank, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, and then-Finance Minister Ngozi Okonji-Iweala were forced to explain their actions on TV.\n\n\"When you have a former top World Bank official and minister of finance begging the Nigerian people for their trust, you know times have changed. And when the man voted Central Bank Governor of 2010 appears humbled and contrite, it is time to sit up and take notice,\"wrote the BBC's Nkem Ifejika at the time.\n\n#NigeriaDecides\n\nTweeters in Nigeria continued to flex their muscles last year as they watched President Goodluck Jonathan peacefully hand over power to opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari after elections last March. \n\nEvery twist and turn of the vote was tweeted with the hashtag #Nigeriadecides.\n\nThe person who read out the count results also became a celebrity among tweeters.\n\nThen-electoral chief Attahiru Jega's calm amid a storm was elevated to super-hero status:\n\nAnd a new verb was created after his response to PDP Elder Orubebe interrupting the announcement of results, accusing him of bias:\n\nThe peaceful transition was declared on Twitter the only way tweeters know how - by changing the hashtag from #Nigeriadecides to #Nigeriadecided\n\n#KOT\n\nKenyans on Twitter affectionately refer to themselves as #KOT - and they are not to be messed with\n\nThe group has become a ferocious part of the Twitter landscape, often campaigning about a perceived injustice.\n\nIn one such case in 2013, they demanded justice after three men accused of gang-raping a 16-year-old were ordered by police to cut grass as punishment. \n\nThey used the hashtag #Justice4Liz and an online petition got more than a million signatures, reported BBC Trending. \n\nLast year, the men each received 15-year jail terms.\n\nKenyans on Twitter are also not afraid to take on the international media. The hashtag #SomeonetellCNN trended worldwide last year as tweeters condemned the news organisation for calling the East Africa nation a\"hotbed of terror\".\n\nIt led to the CNN's Global Executive Vice-President Tony Maddox apologising in person to Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who tweeted:\n\nBurkina Faso's'little bird'\n\nKenyans aren't the only African tweeters to create a community of their compatriots. People in Burkina Faso use the hashtag #lwili when discussing the news to do with the country. We first spotted it in tweets about the coup in 2015. \n\nBBC Africa's Leone Ouedraogo, who is from Burkina Faso, says it is a word in the Moore language, which is widely spoken in the West African nation, and means\"little bird\". \n\nSo we suspect lwili may have been chosen to reflect Twitter's logo.\n\n#FeesMustFall\n\nThe hasthag #FeesmMustFall was used to rally support for South African street protests in opposition to a proposed hike in fees for university students in 2015.\n\nTop universities were closed down as the protests spread to 10 institutions across the country.\n\nWhen the police cracked down on protesters, that too was tweeted:\n\nPresident Jacob Zuma backed down, agreeing to freeze the fees increase, and the hashtag changed to #FeesHaveFallen:\n\n#WhatWouldMagufuliDo\n\nThe hashtag #WhatWouldMagafuliDo spread across the continent at the end of last year to make fun of the new Tanzanian president's money-saving plans.\n\nA month after taking office, Mr Magufuli had cancelled the country's independence day celebrations because he thought they were a waste of money.\n\nInstead, he cleaned the streets on 9 December and encouraged his compatriots to do likewise.\nTL;DR: It is 10 years since the micro-blogging site Twitter started. But it is not all Justin Bieber and One Direction fans.\n\nArticle: By David CornockBBC Wales Parliamentary correspondent\n\nWhat is the Budget?\n\nIt is a speech by the chancellor of the exchequer in which he updates MPs on the economy, the UK government's spending plans and how he plans to pay for them. His decisions affect all of us. \n\nThey also give the government a chance to set the political weather after months when it has been beset by difficulties. \n\nThis is Philip Hammond's second Budget but his first in the autumn. He has decided that from now on all Budgets will be delivered in the autumn. \n\nWhat do we know already?\n\nHousing will be a priority. The prime minister, who said solving the housing crisis was her\"personal mission\", used her party conference speech in October to announce an extra \u00a32bn in affordable housing for England over five years. \n\nThe Wales Office confirmed the Welsh Government will get a population-linked share of this but ministers in Cardiff can decide how to spend the cash. \n\nThere has been speculation Mr Hammond may cut stamp duty for first-time buyers. From next April, stamp duty will be replaced by a land transaction tax in Wales.\n\nThe Treasury has already announced some elements of Wednesday's Budget including money for\"artificial intelligence\", next-generation 5G mobile networks and moves to put driverless cars on UK roads by 2021. \n\nIt is unclear how much of any extra cash will be spent in Wales but devolved governments get a share of spending on the National Productivity Investment Fund in England.\n\nWe do know that the chancellor does not have a lot of money to throw around and is reluctant to borrow more to pay for higher spending. \n\nPublic sector pay\n\nThe pay cap has already been lifted for police and prison officers, although that money had to be found with existing budgets - and there could be further flexibility for some departments, possibly teachers and nurses. One to watch.\n\nOther things to look out for\n\nMr Hammond is under renewed pressure to find more money for the NHS and social care in England to deal with winter pressures. Wales can expect a population-linked share of any increased cash he finds.\n\nSome Conservative MPs are unhappy with school funding in England. Wales, under what's known as the Barnett formula, could get a share of any increase.\n\nUniversal Credit, which combines six existing benefits, will soon be introduced in more areas of Wales and the rest of the UK. \n\nMr Hammond has resisted calls for its roll-out to be paused but may be more amenable to reducing the wait some claimants face for payment from the current six weeks.\n\nA north Wales growth deal?\n\nMr Hammond's predecessor, George Osborne, announced in his March 2016 Budget that it was\"opening the door\"for a growth deal for north Wales. \n\nThese mirror the regional city deals in Cardiff and Swansea, agreements between different levels of government and business to bring in extra investment. \n\nOne of the interesting things about the north Wales growth deal is that the package would cross the Wales-England border.\n\nWhat about the Swansea tidal lagoon?\n\nSupporters of the proposed tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay may also be disappointed by the Budget.\n\nThey may see the Budget as a deadline but the signs are that the chancellor does not.\n\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is still considering a report that recommends the project be given the go-ahead. \n\nIts exclusion from the Budget should not necessarily be seen as bad news.\n\nIt means ministers and officials are still trying to find a way to make the sums add up and deliver the project.\n\nWhat do Welsh MPs want?\n\nWhat does the Welsh Government want?\n\nMore money and policy changes. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford wrote to his UK counterpart to demand more spending on infrastructure, giving the go-ahead to the lagoon and reversing its decision to cancel rail electrification between Cardiff and Swansea.\n\nIn a letter to Chief Secretary Liz Truss, he said:\"I urge the UK government to make it a priority to set aside funding in the Budget to address the very significant under-investment in Wales' rail infrastructure.\n\n\"Equally, with the devolution of the Wales and Borders franchise in 2018, it is only right that we receive a fair and equitable funding settlement.\"\n\nAlthough there has been talk of extra rail investment and new stations, Mr Drakeford is unlikely to get the answers he wants in the Budget.\n\nThere is also no sign the UK government is ready to agree to his request to reverse its decision to rule out the devolution of Air Passenger Duty. \n\nBrexit\n\nIn normal times, the Budget would be the big political event of the year. But these are not normal times and Brexit overshadows everything.\n\nIn his letter, Mr Drakeford foreshadowed a battle over EU funds currently spent in the poorest parts of Wales.  \n\n\"We must have the same level of funding as we benefit from currently and this funding must not be subject to any new UK government constraints or top-slicing,\"he wrote. \n\n\"Any attempt to claw back this money to Whitehall and run it as a UK government programme would fundamentally disrespect devolution.\"\n\nThe UK government plans to set up a UK-wide\"shared prosperity fund\"to replace EU grants but slow progress of Brexit negotiations means, again, that Mr Drakeford is unlikely to be satisfied by the Budget.\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWill Mr Hammond live up to his\"Spreadsheet Phil\"nickname?\n\nIt may be a tribute to his accountant's eye, but as nicknames go, it is so last Budget. He has also been known (sarcastically) as\"Box Office Phil\"for his dry delivery but, apparently, he also answers to the more neutral\"Fiscal Phil\".\nTL;DR: Philip Hammond presents his Autumn Budget as chancellor on Wednesday but what does it mean for Wales?\n\nArticle: The expected benefit-cost ratio (BRC) has fallen from \u00a32.50 to \u00a32.30 in benefits for every pound spent.\n\nThat fall is mainly due to a \u00a310bn rise in the scheme's projected \u00a342.6bn cost, which was added earlier this year. \n\nThe report is the latest update on questions such as who benefits and by how much.\n\nIt also has revised an earlier assumption that business people do not get much work done on trains, a view that was widely criticised at the time. \n\nThe new study has cut by one-third the value put on saving an hour's worth of time getting between meetings or workplaces on a quicker train, to reflect that productive work is also done while travelling. \n\nClosures\n\nBBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott says the new report is an attempt to shift the focus away from a controversial assumption of people not working on trains, and towards the benefits of providing lots of extra capacity on the rail network.\n\nOne part of the report, which came out a day earlier, argued that the alternative to HS2 would mean 14 years of route closures and longer journeys.\n\nA study, prepared by Network Rail and the management consultancy Atkins for the government, said that without the project, there would have to be 2,770 weekend closures on the East Coast, West Coast and Midland main lines for the same intended capacity of HS2.\n\nThis could lead to travel times between London and Leeds doubling.\n\n'Play politics'\n\nTransport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said without the new line, the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines were likely to be overwhelmed. \n\nHe said it would also bring benefits for regional and commuter services, as well as increasing the amount of freight that could be carried by rail. \n\nBut he warned it needed broad political consensus or it would end in nothing:\"You can't play politics with our prosperity. The new North-South line is a multi-billion, multi-year investment in the future of Britain.\"\n\nShadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said:\"We must address the capacity problems that mean thousands of commuters face cramped, miserable journeys into cities like Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London. But there can be no blank cheque and ministers must get a grip on costs.\"\n\nPenny Gaines from the Stop HS2 organisation said:\"The big flaw in the government's argument is that phase one of HS2 won't open to the travelling public until about 2027, meaning there would be no change for passengers until the middle of the next decade.\n\n\"But building HS2 would cause years of disruption at [London] Euston, and other places on the rail network as well as chaos along the route of HS2, with roads being diverted during the build and in some places permanently shut.\"\nTL;DR: The government's latest business case for the HS2 high-speed rail link has slightly lowered the amount of benefit it predicts relative to the cost.\n\nArticle: The 33-year-old, best known for playing Santana Lopez on Glee, had gone missing during a boat trip in California.\n\nAfter a long search, divers found her body on Monday, prompting an outpouring of love and sympathy from her co-stars.\n\n\"She was so independent and strong and the idea of her not being here is something I cannot comprehend,\"wrote Glee actor Kevin McHale on Twitter.\n\n\"She was the single most quick-witted person I've ever met, with a steel-trap memory that could recall the most forgettable conversations from a decade ago.\n\n\"She was the most talented person I've ever known and I'm furious we won't get to see more.\"\n\n\"Rest sweet, Naya. What a force you were. Love and peace to your family,\"added Jane Lynch, who played coach Sue Sylvester on the show.\n\nMany of her former cast-mates gathered at the bank of Lake Piru, near Los Angeles, to pay their respects.\n\nChris Colfer, who played Kurt Hummel in the teen comedy, shared a photo of himself with Rivera on Instagram.\n\n\"How can you convey all your love and respect for someone in one post?\"he wrote in the caption. \n\n\"How can you summarise a decade of friendship and laughter with words alone? \n\n\"If you were friends with Naya Rivera, you simply can't. Her brilliance and humour were unmatched. Her beauty and talent were otherworldly.\"\n\nDarren Criss, who played Blaine Anderson, remembered the star's generosity.\n\n\"I was constantly moved by the degree to which she took care of her family, and how she looked out for her friends,\"he wrote. \n\n\"She showed up for me on numerous occasions where she didn't have to, and I was always so grateful for her friendship then, as I certainly am now.\"\n\nFan tributes\n\nRivera was first reported missing last week, after she rented a pontoon boat with her four-year-old son.\n\nHe was found alone and asleep in the boat and later told police his mother had never returned after swimming in the lake.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Monday, Ventura County Sheriff William Ayub said a body had been found near the surface of the water in the north eastern section of the lake. \n\nPolice were\"confident\"they had found Rivera, based on location, clothing and physical characteristics. An autopsy and dental records will be used to confirm her identity. There were no signs of foul play.\n\nThe discovery came exactly seven years after Rivera's Glee co-star, Cory Monteith, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room of an overdose of heroin and alcohol.\n\nLea Michele, who was the show's lead actress, posted black-and-white photos of both actors on her Instagram story in tribute. \n\nMany cast members also re-posted a video of Rivera and Monteith signing autographs for fans outside Paramount studios in Hollywood.\n\nThe original poster had highlighted how\"Naya and Cory always took the time to meet fans and talk with them\".\n\n\"They were so kind-hearted and they loved and appreciated us so much,\"she added.\n\nFans also posted videos of Rivera's most memorable performances on the show - especially the song If I Die Young, which she sang in an episode commemorating Monteith's death.\n\nOthers shared how important it had been to see Rivera portray a character who was both Latin and LGBT.\n\n\"Naya was a powerhouse not just on Glee, but in life,\"wrote Twitter user @IssyFields. \n\n\"Her portrayal of Santana gave me the confidence to be unapologetically myself and made millions of voices heard. Glee has memorialised her beautiful talents forever because she is, and always will be, a hero.\"\n\nSinger Bryana Salaz said she\"didn't realize the impact\"Rivera had on her life growing up as\"the first POC, LGBTQ character I saw on screen. \n\n\"I grew up listening to you sing, being inspired by the girl on Glee who looks like me and is unapologetically herself. You changed so many lives. Rest easy angel,\"she added.\n\n\"Glee gave me the strength I needed to come to terms with my sexuality,\"added YouTuber Luke Birch. \n\n\"Seeing characters like Santana gave me so much hope and courage.

One of the members messaged on 30 January, saying a little girl had been badly injured and her family needed help.  \n\nMr Mohan said this was not unusual because they had collected money or mobilised help in the past by spreading messages through WhatsApp groups. \n\nMessages on WhatsApp, especially on groups, travel quickly in India where the messaging platform has more than 200 million monthly active users. \n\nBut this time, Mr Mohan said, they needed a lot more money. Dhanyashri had fractures in her spine and her legs, and she also needed surgery. \n\nThat's when some of Mr Mohan's friends suggested creating an online campaign that would crowdsource funds.\"They told me, it will help you reach out to many more people,\"he said. \n\nMr Mohan first contacted the girl's father, A Sridhar, over the phone. Then he met him personally to explain that they were raising money to help Dhanyashri. \n\nMr Sridhar told the BBC that he hopes his daughter will recover soon. He added that he wanted to thank everyone for the money they have contributed.  \n\nThe campaign was launched on 31 January with photos of Dhanyashri and details of what happened. \n\nIt's done\"exceptionally well\"considering it only launched on January 31, Arti Rajan, the communication officer for the crowdfunding platform, told BBC. \n\nShe said the donations varied from $1.56 to $780.

PicklesBBC News global education\n\nBut the tennis superstar has other goals that have nothing to do with sport, but much to do with his own childhood.\n\nHis foundation is funding four researchers per year at Harvard University to work on early years education.\n\nTheir research at the leading US university's Centre on the Developing Child is focused on ways to improve the lives of young children, often those facing poverty and violence.\n\nThis topic is personal to the world's number one tennis player because of his upbringing in Serbia during the Balkans war in the 1990s, after the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.\n\n'Toxic environments'\n\n\"Growing up in a war-torn country is not easy on anyone, most of all the children,\"said Mr Djokovic.\n\n\"They don't have the coping mechanism as adults do and the impact of toxic environments on their life is tremendous.\n\n\"Living with that kind of fear is detrimental for any child's development.\n\n\"And knowing personally how that feels, I promised myself years ago that if I could, I would do anything to help these children. \n\n\"I hope the research in this area will help minimise the trauma these children feel so that they too can grow up mentally strong and healthy individuals.\"\n\nBuilding schools\n\nThe initial aim of the Novak Djokovic Foundation was to build pre-schools and support teacher training in Serbia.\n\nBut the partnership with Harvard began after a meeting in late 2015 between the foundation's chief executive Alberto Lidji and the research centre's director, Jack Shonkoff.\n\nMr Lidji describes Dr Shonkoff as\"the Mick Jagger of early childhood development research\".\n\n\"It was an area where we realised we could make a difference,\"said Mr Lidji.\n\n\"There are a lot of gaps within the body of knowledge on early childhood development and we realised that if we could deploy some of our resources to help to fill them, that would drive the field forward,\"he said.\n\nThe name recognition and fame of the tennis player helped to open doors, said Mr Lidji, connecting with\"stakeholders who would otherwise not be engaged in early childhood development\".\n\nIt was also not just a token involvement, said Mr Lidji, as despite the hectic international tennis circuit, Mr Djokovic has stayed closely involved with the foundation.\n\nEarliest influences\n\nDr Shonkoff founded the Centre on the Developing Child in 2006, with the aim of learning how to intervene in children's early years to improve their life outcomes.\n\nIt was an area in which he thought there was a lack of investment and which was not taken seriously enough.\n\n\"People thought that because none of us can remember our experiences as babies, the early years don't matter much,\"he said.\n\nBut since then, a\"revolution\"in biology and neuroscience has changed that perception.\n\n\"We now know that what happens very early in life can have a lasting effect on lifelong outcomes on school performance and physical and mental health,\"he said.\n\n\"The early years have gone from being something which is seen as a responsibility of families to a public responsibility, because it's a return on investment that everyone benefits from.\"\n\nDr Shonkoff calls on governments to invest more in improving how they intervene early in children's lives.\n\nForced separation\n\n\"Many of the challenges ministers deal with, including economic productivity, skill building, physical and mental health, all have origins much earlier in life than school entry,\"he said. \n\nAs an example of the potential long-term impact, Dr Shonkoff highlights the separation of child refugees from their parents in the United States. \n\n\"Sudden, forcible separation of children from their parents is deeply traumatic for both,\"he said. \n\n\"Stated simply, each day we fail to return these children to their parents, we compound the harm and increase the lifelong consequences.\"\n\nDr Shonkoff emphasised the far-reaching importance of early experiences.\n\n\"If we focus more on the foundations of early learning, starting in infancy, we will get much better educational outcomes, have a better educated and more skilled population, and we will pay less for it,\"he said.\n\nNovak Djokovic hopes the research work funded by his sporting triumphs will continue to improve the lives of young children long after he hangs up his tennis racket.\n\nMore from Global education\n\nThe editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk).\nTL;DR: Novak Djokovic has been battling in the Australian Open this week.\n\nArticle: The city council said this week the annual fireworks display at King George V playing fields in Cosham would go ahead on Wednesday, but there would be no bonfire due to its \u00a34,600 cost.\n\nConservative councillors had blamed the cancellation on the previous Liberal Democrat administration.\n\nBut a skip hire company has come forward to provide free firewood.\n\nL&S Waste Management will also provide skips and grab lorries for the clean-up afterwards. \n\nThe firework event, which will cost nearly \u00a320,000 to run, will be funded by the council, along with donations of \u00a31,120 from transport company Stagecoach and local travel campaign My Journey.\n\nA council spokesman said most of the cost of putting on a bonfire would go on security and safety measures, as well as buying\"clean\"wood - which has no harmful chemicals on it - and re-seeding the grass afterwards.\n\nA Conservative minority administration has been running the authority since elections in May.\n\nGerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of the Lib Dems group, said the previous decision to cancel the bonfire was supported by every councillor, of all parties.\nTL;DR: Portsmouth's traditional 5 November bonfire has been saved after it was cancelled due to council budget cuts.\n\nArticle: Mr Piech told German news magazine Der Spiegel that he had\"distanced\"himself from Mr Winterkorn, who was widely tipped as the firm's next chairman.\n\nMr Piech's family and the Porsche family control 51% of VW between them.\n\nBoard member Wolfgang Porsche said Mr Piech had given his\"personal opinion\".\n\nMr Porsche, who is Mr Piech's cousin, said the chairman had not cleared his remarks with family members.\n\nDuring his eight-year tenure as chief executive, Mr Winterkorn has overhauled VW and made it one of the world's most successful carmakers, industry analysts say.\n\nSince Mr Piech's remarks were published on Friday, Mr Winterkorn has received the backing of Lower Saxony state, a minor shareholder in VW, as well as the support of the company's employee council, which holds half the seats on the firm's 20-strong supervisory board.\n\nIn 2014, VW was the world's second-biggest carmaker by sales, behind Toyota and ahead of GM.\n\nApart from Volkswagen, the group's brands include Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley, Skoda and Seat.\nTL;DR: Divisions have emerged in the leadership of German car giant Volkswagen after chairman Ferdinand Piech gave an interview criticising chief executive Martin Winterkorn.\n\nArticle: Sensors allow it to make more than 250,000 3D measurements every second and update its position in real time. \n\nGoogle said potential applications may include indoor mapping, helping the visually-impaired navigate unfamiliar indoor places unassisted and gaming.\n\nIt has offered 200 prototypes to developers keen to make apps for it.\n\nGoogle said its Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) unit developed the phone as part of a project called Project Tango with help from researchers at various institutions.\n\n\"We are physical beings that live in a 3D world. Yet, our mobile devices assume that physical world ends at the boundaries of the screen,\"the firm said. \n\n\"The goal of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion.\n\n\"We're ready to put early prototypes into the hands of developers that can imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality,\"it added.\n\n'Smart' technology\n\nVarious firms, including Google, have been looking at developing niche technology. \n\nFor its part, Google has already unveiled its Google Glass - the intelligent specs due to go on sale later this year. \n\nEarlier this year, the firm said it is also working on a\"smart contact lens\"that can help measure glucose levels in tears.\n\nAlso in January, it bought DeepMind, a UK firm that specialises in artificial intelligence, for \u00a3400m. \n\nAccording to DeepMind's website it builds\"powerful general-purpose learning algorithms\".\n\nAnalysts say that firms have been looking at ways to help bring the advances made in technology to practical use in every day life in an attempt to attract more customers.\n\n\"The focus is not just on the hardware or the device, but on what the gadget can actually do,\"Bryan Ma, associate vice president at research firm IDC told the BBC.\n\n\"It is all about taking it to the next level of usage - be it augmented reality, help with basic healthcare or even just creating better maps.\"\n\nMr Ma added that once fully developed such gadgets could have huge commercial applications as well - which would help drive demand not only among individual consumers but also businesses and corporate users. \n\n\"There could be a lot of opportunity waiting to be exploited in this area,\"he said.\n\nLast year, Japanese firm Sony filed a patent for a\"SmartWig\", with healthcare cited as one of its potential uses along with the ability to help blind people navigate roads.\n\nIt said the wig could use a combination of sensors to help collect information such as temperature, pulse and blood pressure of the wearer.\nTL;DR: Google has unveiled a prototype smartphone with \"customised hardware and software\" that enables it to create 3D maps

Clwyd West Conservative MP said in September it was time for him to step aside at the age of 67.\n\nBut Mr Jones said the decision to call a snap election on 12 December had made him think again.\n\nThe pro-Brexit MP, who was elected in 2005, played a significant role in the Welsh Vote Leave campaign in 2016.\n\n\"The position is that I have been asked by a number of members of my association to stand,\"Mr Jones told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\n\"I have also had a number of constituents who have asked me to stand.\n\n\"I am particularly\u00a0keen to ensure that I'm in the House at the time that Brexit is ultimately\u00a0delivered because I have spent the best part of the last four years concentrating\u00a0on Brexit and I had hoped that it would have been concluded by the time I had left.\n\n\"Because of what has happened over the last few weeks, clearly that is\u00a0not going to be the case.\n\n\"So I want to come back to help deliver Brexit.\"\n\nMr Jones served as a Welsh Secretary under David Cameron for two years, with his tenure ending in 2014.\n\nDuring his time in the cabinet he clashed with then-Welsh Conservative assembly leader Andrew RT Davies over an eventually-scrapped restriction to income tax powers for the assembly.\n\nHe later served as a Brexit minister during Theresa May's administration.\nTL;DR: Former Welsh Secretary and Brexit minister David Jones has reversed his decision to stand down at the next general election.\n\nArticle: Undercliff Drive, on the Isle of Wight, has been closed since February when two landslips left nine homes cut off.\n\nLast month, residents took matters into their own hands by getting the road tarmacked but safety inspectors deemed it dangerous and cordoned it off again.\n\nA highways report has recommended pedestrian access is built along with a low-cost road to the west.\n\nOther options include re-establishing pedestrian access only and building access to the north of the affected properties.\n\n'Fail without warning'\n\nThe Isle of Wight executive is due to consider the report on 11 November.\n\nIn the meantime, the resurfaced road, near St Lawrence, remains blocked off by the council amid fears it\"could fail without warning\".\n\nResidents had initially hoped they would be allowed to use it at their own risk.\n\nA four-mile detour was put in place after the road was first damaged. Eight families are still living in rented accommodation after being evacuated from their homes.\n\nIn September, Isle of Wight Council agreed to spend \u00a3500,000 researching a solution to repair the road, which is on a still-active landslip.\nTL;DR: Access to homes cut off by a landslide could be reinstated if recommendations are agreed by councillors.\n\nArticle: It comes as a report is published into an outbreak of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) at Glan Clwyd hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, this year.\n\nIt was one of a series of problems which resulted in the resignation of three senior Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) figures.\n\nThe new head of nursing said the board has\"acted quickly\"to make changes.\n\nBetween January and May this year there were 96 cases of C. diff infection at Glan Clwyd hospital.\n\nAt least seven patients who died were found to be carrying the bug.\n\nThe outbreak followed a period in which C. diff infection rates within the Betsi Cadwaladr board area were higher than in most other parts of Wales.\n\nBCUHB runs NHS services in the six counties of north Wales with a budget of around \u00a31.2bn.\n\nIn June three senior figures resigned after a damning report on its\"significant management failings\".\n\nThe chairman, chief executive and vice-chairman stepped down after health and audit watchdogs found a range of problems, including infection control.\n\n'Everyone's responsibility'\n\nAn initial report prepared by Public Health Wales had highlighted that the systems to monitor and manage infection control issues within the health board were not operating\"consistently and effectively\".\n\nAs a result the health board asked Professor Brian Duerden, emeritus professor of medical microbiology at Cardiff University, to conduct an independent expert review of infection controls, and to recommend improvements.\n\nHis report published on Tuesday said more needed to be done to improve infection prevention and control\"especially in terms of leadership and management\".\n\nProf Duerden looked at all aspects of the way infection control issues were handled at the hospital from individual job responsibilities to the management hierarchy.\n\n\"It is well recognised that when there are weaknesses in a system, infections is one of the first challenges that will expose those weaknesses,\"the report said.\n\n\"The phrase'infection prevention and control is everyone's responsibility' means exactly what it says,\"it added.\n\n'Zero-tolerance'\n\nThe health board said it has already acted on recommendations.\n\n\"First we must apologise to the people of North Wales that our infection control practices have not been as good as they should have been,\"said Angela Hopkins, recently appointed executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services.\n\n\"We have made it clear that we have an attitude of'zero-tolerance' to preventable infection across the organisation,\"she added.\n\n\"As an immediate step I have brought in a leading expert in infection prevention to work with us in north Wales as we improve our wider infection control services.\n\n\"We have also put in place a weekly monitoring system at board level and we now have infection control groups led by senior clinical staff in each acute hospital to make sure there are clear lines of reporting and accountability at a local level.  \n\n\"We are also in the process of recruiting additional nurses to our infection control teams.\"\n\nMrs Hopkins said she hoped that by commissioning and publishing the report, and acting on its findings, BCUHB will be able to\"demonstrate and assure patients of the health board's determination to make the necessary and urgent improvements\".\n\nDarren Millar AM, the Conservatives' shadow minister for health, said it was\"unforgiveable that senior managers took their eyes off the ball and allowed standards to drop\".\n\n\"This report must be swiftly digested by senior NHS staff and the Welsh Labour Government to ensure that lessons are learnt so patients are not put at risk again,\"he said.\nTL;DR: Health officials have apologised for their failure to control infections at a north Wales hospital.\n\nArticle: The Leicester rockers will line up alongside La Roux and Calvin Harris (DJ set) for the late night show at Shepherds Bush Empire on 16

was shot in the head some hours afterwards and died in hospital. \n\nInquiry counsel said the killing is\"the most horrific incident of child abuse to come before the HIA Inquiry\". \n\nIt was revealed that the school authorities did not report the abduction to the police. \n\nResidential institutions\n\nBut the inquiry counsel added:\"Identifying potential systems failures by those who regulated or ran a training school does not take from the fact that it was the IRA who murdered Bernard Teggart, a 15-year-old boy said to have a mental age of an eight or nine-year-old.\"\n\nThe teenager's father Danny had been shot dead by the Parachute Regiment in Ballymurphy in 1971, along with 10 others.  \n\nBernard's brother John Teggart said he wants his brother's  murder fully investigated.\n\n\"What we need now, we need a thorough investigation, just like an investigation of what happened to my father in August 1971,\"he said. \n\n\"Let's start with an investigation into

You have the RUC were dealing with it at the time - let's bring that forward.\n\n\"Whether it's independent or whether it's any other, let's bring it forward and let's be open and honest.\"\n\nThe inquiry was told that Bernard was abducted along with his twin brother, Gerry, who had also been taken from the school the week before.\n\nThe two brothers were taken to a number of houses and interrogated. Eight hours later Barney was found lying fatally wounded beside a roadside in north Belfast. He died some time later in hospital.\n\nGerry Teggart was released by the killers.\n\nOne possible reason for the murder of the teenager was that he had witnessed an IRA robbery at a beer company and told the robbers who were threatening a beer lorry driver to leave him alone.\n\nThe HIA inquiry was set up in 2013 to investigate child abuse in residential institutions in Northern Ireland over a 73-year period, up to 1995.\n\nIn total, the inquiry is expected to hear from more than 300 witnesses during the course of the public evidence sessions.\n\nIt is required to complete its hearings and all investigative work by mid-summer 2016, and has to submit its report to the Northern Ireland executive by 17 January 2017.\nTL;DR:",

It could be a family living together, flatmates in the same property, or even individuals renting rooms in the same house.\n\nThere is no restriction on the number of people in a household - as long as they are always the same people.\n\nAn extended household is when two of those households come together as one.\n\nFor example, two grandparents could agree to become part of an extended household with their daughter and her partner and children.\n\nThe two households could then visit each other as much as they wish, go indoors, and even stay overnight.\n\nWhere's the catch?\n\nThere are restrictions - and it could mean some tough choices for individuals.\n\nThe main rule is this: Once you join an extended household - you cannot join another.\n\nIf it is our grandparents enjoying Sunday lunch with their daughter and grandchildren at the family home, those same grandparents cannot then decide they want to join with another family member next week.\n\nThey cannot decide they are ditching the daughter for their favourite son. \n\nOnce you are in a extended household, there is no swapping members - you have to stick with your original choice.\n\nAnd a word of warning: If one person in your extended household develops Covid-19 symptoms, every member of that extended household will be asked to self-isolate.\n\nWhat if we share custody of a child?\n\nThere are always exceptions to the rule - and this is one of them. \n\nIf your child divides their time between two homes they can be a member of extended families in both homes.\n\nBut I live in a shared house? \n\nIn this case, where several people are renting separate rooms in a single property they do not have to form a single household themselves - and they can join other extended households. \n\nOf course, where you may be sharing bathrooms and kitchens in a multiple-occupancy house, the Welsh Government points out it will increase the risk of spreading coronavirus - so they suggest have a good think and conversations with your housemates first.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of people in extended households?\n\nNo, there is no limit. But again, you cannot swap people in or out. Once they are in, they are in.\n\nI am in an extended household. Who else can I meet - and where?\n\nNo more than two households can get together - and then they have to meet outside.\n\nIt is exactly the same for extended households. \n\nTwo extended households can meet - but they have to meet outside, and the two groups should also observe social-distancing rules.\n\nTwo families - our grandparents and their son or daughter, for example, who are in a single extended household - can meet another extended family household - perhaps their other son or daughter and their in-laws who have decided to bubble together.\n\nBut it must be outdoors. \n\nIs there a limit on the number of people in extended households getting together?\n\nAs long as it is only two extended households coming together, there is no limit on numbers of people - as there is no limit on the size of a single extended household.\n\nAgain, it has to be outside, and separate households should remain socially distanced.\n\nSo yes, if you want to have a barbecue with your extended household and your neighbour's extended household you can - if you want.\n\nCan I meet more than one extended household at a time?\n\nNo, you cannot. Only two households can come together at once. \n\nYour neighbour's friends cannot tag along to that barbecue in the back garden - sorry.\n\nCould I meet my friends in the pub then instead?\n\nYou cannot meet in the pub just yet - indoor cafes, bars and restaurants in Wales remain closed until 3 August.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for pub beer gardens.\n\nOutdoor parts of pubs and restaurants could open in Wales from 13 July.\n\nThe latest regulations allow gatherings of\"no more than 30 persons\"- as long as it has been organised by:\n\nOf course, all those groups also have to meet strict health and safety rules before they can open their doors to you and your mates. \n\nDon't expect it to be a\"normal\"pint out.\n\nWhat else can I do?\n\nIf it is not a beer or a meal you are after there are now plenty more things you can do in your extended household.\n\nSelf-contained holiday accommodation is open for business and bookings across Wales, with all travel restrictions lifted.\n\nWhile they may be thinking about some sun worshipping - with Welsh weather, they may need a prayer or two.\n\nAnd you'd be in luck there too - as faith leaders are also preparing to welcome back congregations from this week.\n\nFun in the sun\n\nOutdoor exercise classes, team games such as cricket and sports clubs can meet again. \n\nFrom Monday 20 July, there will be some playground relief for your youngsters during the summer holidays as they are allowed to reopen.\n\nAlso opening on Monday are community centres, outdoor gyms, and funfairs.\n\nThe great outdoors beckon on 25 July when campsites will be allowed to reopen.\n\nStay indoors?\n\nOn 27 July, cinemas, museums and galleries in Wales will be allowed to open their doors once more.\n\nYou will also be able to get a beauty salon pamper - and if you've the urge for ink, tattoo parlours are opening again.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nA reminder from the First Minister Mark Drakeford himself:\"We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.\n\n\"It is not over. Coronavirus is still here in Wales - and in the absence of a vaccine, it could be with us for some time yet.\"\nTL;DR: As lockdown restrictions continue to be eased in Wales, many are asking what they can - and cannot do - under the latest rules and guidance.\n\nArticle: The 80-year-old\"passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness\", the foundation named after him said.\n\nHis home country, Ghana, has declared a week of national mourning. Annan served two terms as UN chief from 1997 to 2006, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work.\n\nHe later served as the UN special envoy for Syria, leading efforts to find a solution to the conflict.\n\nIn a statement announcing his death, the Kofi Annan Foundation described him as a\"global statesman and deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world\". \n\n\"Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy.\"\n\nThe career diplomat died in hospital in the Swiss city of Bern.

This is the\"instruction booklet\"that describes how elementary particles (the smallest building blocks of the Universe) and forces interact.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, two years ago this week, Cern announced that a five-decade-long search for the particle, first proposed by Edinburgh-based physicist Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s, had reached its conclusion. \n\nScientists working on Atlas and CMS, the two huge multi-purpose detectors placed at strategic points around the LHC tunnel, saw the Higgs at a 5-sigma level of significance - the statistical threshold for announcing a discovery.\n\nWhile the LHC has been sitting idle of late, its scientists have not. They've continued to crunch the results from the first science run, and hundreds of them will gather to listen to the latest findings at the ICHEP physics meeting in Valencia, Spain, this week.\n\nParticle physicists have learnt more about the Higgs boson's behaviour and how well it conforms to predictions. In a paper published last week in the journal Nature Physics, researchers outlined how they have watched the Higgs decay into the particles that make up matter (known as fermions), in addition to those that convey force (bosons), which had already been observed.\n\nThis is exactly as the Standard Model predicts. Physicists know that this framework, devised in the 1970s, must be a stepping stone to a deeper understanding of the cosmos. But so far, it's standing up exceptionally well. Searches at the LHC for deviations from this elegant scheme - such as evidence for new, exotic particles - have come to nothing.\n\nAt ICHEP, other scientists are expected to outline details of a refined mass for the fundamental particle, which has been measured at approximately 125 gigaelectronvolts (GeV). For those outside the particle physics community, this might seem like a minor detail. But the mass of the Higgs is more than a mere number.\n\nThere's something very curious about its value that could have profound implications for the Universe. Mathematical models allow for the possibility that our cosmos is long-lived yet not entirely stable, and may - at some indeterminate point - be destroyed. \n\n\"The overall stability of the Universe depends on the Higgs mass - which is a bit funny,\"said Prof Jordan Nash, a particle physicist from Imperial College London, who works on the CMS experiment at Cern. \n\n\"There's a long theoretical argument which I won't go into, but that value is intriguing in that it sits on the edge between what we think is the long-term stability of the Universe and a Universe that has a finite lifetime.\"\n\nTo use an analogy, imagine the Higgs boson is an object resting at the bottom of a curved slope. If that resting place really is the lowest point on the slope, then the vacuum of space is completely stable - in other words, it is in the lowest energy state and can go no further.\n\nHowever, if at some point further along this slope, there's another dip, the potential exists for the Universe to\"topple\"into this lower energy state, or minimum. If that happens, the vacuum of space collapses, dooming the cosmos.\n\n\"The Higgs mass is in that place where it gets interesting, where it's no longer guaranteed that there are no other minima,\"Prof Nash, who works on the CMS experiment at Cern, told the BBC.  But there's no need to worry, the models suggest such a rare event would not occur for a very, very long time - many times further into the future, in fact, than the current age of the Universe.\n\nThis idea of a finite lifetime for the cosmos is dependent on the Standard Model being the ultimate scheme in physics. But there is much in the Universe - gravitation and dark matter, for example - that the Standard Model can't fully explain, so there are reasons to think that's not the case. \n\nThe existence of exotic particles, such as those predicted by the theory known as supersymmetry, would shore up the stability of the Universe in those mathematical models.\n\nBut as previously mentioned, searches for these particles, called superpartners, have so far drawn a blank, as have attempts to detect dark matter, extra dimensions, and other phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Hopes that the LHC would allow scientists to lift the veil on a whole new realm of physics have proved optimistic, at least during its initial run. \n\nSome versions of supersymmetry have already been all but ruled out by the LHC. But the theory has many forms, depending on how you tweak the mathematical parameters.\n\n\"From the theory community's point of view, this is all very interesting because it fleshes out much better what the first run of the LHC has excluded,\"said Prof Dave Charlton, who leads the Atlas experiment at Cern.\n\n\"Therefore, it better establishes where we should be looking for new signals next year.\"\n\nAssuming the theorists are indeed correct, supersymmetry will have to wait some time longer for its big reveal.\n\nOther hypothesised particles, such as the W prime and Z prime bosons could possibly be detected soon after the LHC returns to particle smashing.\n\nFor now, all eyes are on the engineers at Cern. The LHC's initial switch on was marked by mishaps, including a magnet that buckled in the tunnel during a test in 2007. The following year, another magnet failure caused a tonne of helium to leak out, forcing controllers to shut the machine down just nine days after its big switch-on.\n\nBut after the re-start in 2009, the LHC performed flawlessly, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIf all goes well, by the end of March 2015 scientists could begin colliding high-energy beams of particles at the LHC.\n\nAnd that's when the real fun will begin.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.\nTL;DR: It's nearly time. After shutting down last year for vital repairs and upgrades, the Large Hadron Collider is being prepared for its comeback.\n\nArticle: Chris CookPolicy editor, Newsnight\n\nThe data would help ascertain which tower blocks fitted with cladding may be unsafe in the event of a fire.\n\nLord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said authorities lack the information they need to make such judgments.\n\nThe test results, however, are considered commercially confidential.\n\nLord Porter said:\"The results that are done by the private sector must... be made public. Some tests have been done, but\u2026 the commercial companies that have done those tests are under no obligation [to share the information].\"\n\nHis call comes as the BBC learns that burning cladding on Grenfell Tower would have released 14 times more heat than a key government safety test allows.\n\n'Fire test' vs'desktop study'\n\nLord Porter is seeking data from tests designed to check that cladding which contains combustible components is installed in a safe manner. These tests and studies would have taken place prior to the installation of cladding on buildings. \n\nThey are the basis of the two principal routes for getting a proposed cladding design that uses combustible parts certified for use in a tall building.  \n\nFirst, developers can seek approval for a design by testing the response to fire of a mock-up of their proposed cladding design in a laboratory - a so-called\"fire test\".\n\nSecond, they can also by ask an engineer to certify that their design is similar to one that has already been tested - a so-called\"desktop study\".\n\nSome of the buildings discovered in recent weeks to have combustible exterior cladding may, in fact, be installed in a way that was robustly tested via a fire test. In such a case, removing the cladding may not be necessary.\n\nIf, however, the cladding design has only been subjected to a desktop study, the evidence base supporting the cladding design may not be as robust. \n\nNewsnight has previously reported on cases where a desktop study argued that a design using aluminium composite panels did not need to be subjected to a fire test because it was similar enough to a design that had already been tested. \n\nThat design, however, used ceramic tiles instead of aluminium panels - a material that behaves very differently in fire.\n\nThe programme has also previously revealed that some building inspection agencies have approved buildings that use combustible cladding and insulation without even requesting a desktop study. \n\nIn such cases, there may be no evidence at all supporting the design's safety.\n\n'The public will never have faith'\n\nOfficials have not, however, been able to obtain copies of tests and reports to establish how robust the evidence base is for each building. \n\nThe reports are treated as commercially confidential and the intellectual property within them usually belongs to the makers of the insulation.  \n\nLord Porter told Newsnight that the laboratory responsible for doing most of the testing, the Buildings Research Establishment,\"say that they can't share the test results\u2026 because they're subject to intellectual property\u2026 The tests that they've done belong to the companies.\"\n\nHe said he was appealing to these companies to waive their rights to confidentiality. \n\nLord Porter continued:\"My worry is that the public will never have faith in what's done until it's done in a transparent way.\"\nTL;DR: A local government leader has called for the release of confidential fire test data from private companies.\n\nArticle: Italy has reported its fifth death from the virus and has 165 cases - the most in a European country.\n\nIn the regions of Lombardy and Veneto, a lock-down is in place in several small towns. \n\nFor the next two weeks, 50,000 residents will not be able to leave without special permission.\n\nIn its advice, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs lists the regions of Piemonte, Lombardai, Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Lazio.\n\nWorld edges closer to coronavirus pandemic\n\nAnalysis by Fergus Walsh, medical correspondent\n\nThe combined situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy points to the early stages of pandemic. \n\nIn each of these countries we are seeing spread of the virus with no connection to China. The lockdown efforts in Italy mirror those that have happened in China.\n\nThe situation in Iran is especially worrying, because the health authorities have reportedly said the virus has spread to multiple cities, and it appears the first case in Lebanon is linked to a traveller from Iran.\n\nIf we have a pandemic, it will still be important to limit the speed of spread of the virus.\n\nIf countries could hold it somewhat at bay until the end of winter, there is a hope that warmer temperatures will reduce the time the virus can survive in the air, as we see with seasonal flu. But this may not be certain.\n\nIreland's chief medical officer has said he anticipates that Monday's meeting of the European Centre of Disease Control to examine the outbreak of coronavirus in Italy, is likely to lead to some changes in advice to European countries.\n\nDr Tony Holohan said the department would respond accordingly and update its advice.\n\nHe said Ireland remained in a containment phase and that as things stood enforced quarantine was not part of the Health Service Executive's plans.\n\nHe said the most likely scenario was that cases would appear in small numbers and hospitals were prepared to deal with that. So far, 79 tests have been reported negative. \n\nDr Holohan said the best chance of identifying the disease was for those who had travelled from an area with coronavirus and have symptoms to report those symptoms to health experts.\nTL;DR: Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has advised its citizens not to travel to areas of Italy affected by the coronavirus.\n\nArticle: The day-long strike on Tuesday will cover about 370 Crown Post Offices - 70 of which are due to be franchised or partnered with a retailer.  \n\nCrown Post Offices are the bigger branches found on high streets.\n\nThe Post Office said the action was extremely disappointing and that the strike would affect 3% of branches. \n\nThe network is losing \u00a340m a year, so officials plan to close a handful of Crown Post Offices and have begun the process of looking for retailers to run 70 more. \n\nFourth strike\n\nThe main postal union - the Communication Workers Union (CWU) - warns this could hit 800 jobs.\n\nCrown offices are branches directly managed by the company, as opposed to locally run by sub-post offices.\n\nThe CWU said the branches handle about a fifth of Post Office business and 40% of financial services sales.\n\nTuesday's strike will be the fourth time postal workers have taken industrial action since Easter. \n\nAround 150 Crown Post Offices were forced to close their doors during the last strike.  \n\nMeanwhile, the CWU is already in dispute with the Post Office over pay.  \n\nThe CWU claims staff have not had a pay rise for two years and is calling for a rise in consolidated pay.\n\nBut the Post Office has said a pay offer of three cash payments was\"extremely fair\".\nTL;DR: Staff at some of the UK's largest post offices are taking industrial action in a growing dispute over closures, franchising, jobs and pay.\n\nArticle: By Hugh Schofield BBC News, Paris\n\nThe question worries a lot of people - oenophiles, cultural commentators, flag-wavers for French exceptionalism - all of whom have watched with consternation the gradual disappearance of wine from the national dinner table. \n\nRecent figures merely confirm what has been observed for years, that the number of regular drinkers of wine in France is in freefall.\n\nIn 1980 more than half of adults were consuming wine on a near-daily basis. Today that figure has fallen to 17%.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of French people who never drink wine at all has doubled to 38%.\n\nIn 1965, the amount of wine consumed per head of population was 160 litres a year. In 2010 that had fallen to 57 litres, and will most likely dip to no more than 30 litres in the years ahead.\n\nAt dinner, wine is the third most popular drink after tap and bottled water. Sodas and fruit juices are catching up fast and are now just a short way behind.\n\nAccording to a recent study in the International Journal of Entrepreneurship, changes in French drinking habits are clearly visible through the attitudes of successive generations.\n\nPeople in their 60s and 70s grew up with wine on the table at every meal. For them, wine remains an essential part of their patrimoine, or cultural heritage.\n\nThe middle generation - now in their 40s and 50s - sees wine as a more occasional indulgence. They compensate for declining consumption by spending more money. They like to think they drink less but better. \n\nMembers of the third generation - the internet generation - do not even start taking an interest in wine until their mid-to-late 20s. For them, wine is a product like any other, and they need persuading that it is worth their money.\n\n\"What has happened is a progressive erosion of wine's identity, and of its sacred and imaginary representations,\"say the report's authors, Thierry Lorey and Pascal Poutet.\n\n\"Over three generations, this has led to the changes in France's habits of consumption and the steep declines in the volume of wine that is drunk.\"\n\nThe fall in consumption is mirrored in other countries - such as Italy and Spain - which are also historic producers of wine. And it has not dented the prospects for exports of French wine, which continues to hold its own abroad.\n\nBut what worries people are the effects of the change on life inside France, on French civilisation.\n\nThey fear that time-honoured French values - conviviality, tradition and appreciation of the good things in life - are on the way out. Taking their place is a utilitarian,\"hygieno-moralistic\"new order, cynically purveyed by an alliance of politics, media and global business.\n\n\"Wine is not some trophy product that we roll out to celebrate the grand occasions or to show off our social status. It is a table drink intended to accompany the meal and provide a complement to whatever is on our plate,\"says food writer Perico Legasse.\n\n\"Wine is an element in the meal. But what has happened is that it's gone from being popular to elitist. It is totally ridiculous. It should be perfectly possible to drink moderately of good quality wine on a daily basis.\"\n\nFor Legasse, part of the fault is a changing national approach to food and gastronomy as a whole.\n\n\"For many years people have been steadily abandoning what in our French sociology we referred to as the repas, or meal, by which I mean a convivial gathering around a table, and not the individualised, accelerated version we see today. \n\n\"The traditional family meal is withering away. Instead we have a purely technical form of nourishment, whose aim is to make sure we fuel up as effectively and as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWine drinking in France is certainly part of a long-standing way of life, but it would be wrong to suppose that the French have always drunk as much as they did, say, 50 years ago.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, wine was commonly drunk (at least in wine-growing areas), but it was a weak concoction and popular mainly because - unlike water - it was safe. \n\nThe Revolution of 1789 dispelled the aristocratic image that wine had, by then, acquired, and the economic changes of 19th Century helped it permeate society.\n\nDenis Saverot, editor of La Revue des Vins de France magazine, says the rise of wine mirrored the rise of the working class. But it was the war of 1914-18 that really secured its position in the hearts of the French.\n\n\"Basically the soldiers went over the top pickled on pinard, the strong, low-quality wine which was supplied in bulk. Up until then the Normans, the Bretons, the people of Picardy and the north, they had never touched wine. But they learned in the trenches. \n\n\"After that in France we generalised the consumption of cheap wine so that by the 1950s there were drinking outlets, cafes and bars, everywhere. Tiny villages would have five or six. But that was the high point. The decline in consumption goes back to the 1960s.\"\n\nEveryone agrees on the main factors. Fewer people work outdoors, so the fortifying qualities of wine are less in demand. Offices require people to stay awake, so lunchtimes are, by and large, dry.\n\nThen there is the rise of the car (\"wine's worst enemy\"for Saverot), changing demographics, with France's large Muslim minority, and the growing popularity of beers and mixers.\n\nBut Saverot has another target in his sights.\n\n\"It is our bourgeois, technocratic elite with their campaigns against drink-driving and alcoholism, lumping wine in with every other type of alcohol, even though it should be regarded as totally different,\"he says. \n\n\"Recently I heard one senior health official saying that wine causes cancer'from the very first glass'. That coming from a Frenchman. I was flabbergasted. In hock with the health lobby and the politically correct, our elites prefer to keep the country on chemical anti-depressants and wean us off wine.\n\n\"Just look at the figures. In the 1960s, we were drinking 160 litres each a year and weren't taking any pills. Today we consume 80 million packets of anti-depressants, and wine sales are collapsing. Wine is the subtlest, most civilised, most noble of anti-depressants. But look at our villages. The village bar has gone, replaced by a pharmacy.\"\n\nVeteran observer of his nation's way of life, Oxford-based French writer Theodore Zeldin agrees that a business-style culture has made huge inroads into France - the bane of all those who prefer to take the time to savour things. \n\n\"Companionship has been replaced by networking. Business means busy-ness, and in that way we are becoming like everywhere else,\"he says.\n\nBut Zeldin refuses to abandon hope.\n\n\"The old French art de vivre is still there. It's an ideal. It's a bit like the ideal of an English gentleman. You don't often find an English gentleman, but the ideal is there and it informs society as a whole,\"he says.\n\n\"It is the same with our art de vivre. Of course times have changed, but it still survives. It is that feeling you get in France that in human relations we need to do more than just conduct business. We have a duty to entertain, to converse. And in France - thanks to our education system - we still have that ability to converse in a general, universalist way that has been lost elsewhere. \n\n\"That is the art de vivre. It is about taking your time. And wine is part of it, because with wine you have to take your time.\n\n\"After all, that is one of the great things about wine. You can't swig it.\"\n\nYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook\nTL;DR: Does the seemingly perpetual decline in consumption of France's national drink symbolise a corresponding decline in French civilisation?\n\nArticle: By Joe MillerBBC News, Davos\n\nThat's the verdict of veteran journalist Alan Murray, now chief content officer at Time Inc, the parent company of Time and Fortune magazines.\n\n\"Trump has been good for the economic viability of the American media,\"he says, citing the bump in digital subscriptions at the New York Times, the Washington Post and the increase in traffic at his own business in the wake of the presidential election.\n\n\"But I think he has been bad for the credibility of the media\".\n\nThere is research to back him up. According to public relation behemoth Edelman's latest\"trust barometer\", the media has become the least-trusted institution in the world. In the US, more than 70% of Donald Trump's supporters distrust mainstream outlets.  \n\nThis, Mr Murray warns, is having a corrosive effect on the business of journalism in America - despite an increasingly engaged audience.\n\n'Dual crisis'\n\n\"The media in the US is in the midst of two simultaneous crises, which predated Donald Trump,\"he explains, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\n\"One is an economic crisis: how do we make enough money to support what we do?\"\n\n\"The other is a credibility crisis. In a world where anyone can be a publisher, and people are sitting in their pyjamas in their bedrooms putting out stuff on Facebook and the internet - how do people know what to believe?\"\n\nThat task, he adds, is made all the more difficult by the man in the Oval Office.\n\n\"It's very difficult when the president takes things that simply have no basis in truth and puts them into his Twitter feed,\"says Mr Murray, referring to when Donald Trump took aim at one of Mr Murray's own publications, Time.\n\nLast November, the president tweeted that:\"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named'Man (Person) of the Year' like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway\"\n\nThis claim, says Mr Murray, was\"just completely untrue.\"\n\n\"I was well aware of the thought that went into who was going to be Person of the Year this year, Trump was never on the list.\"\n\nNo one, he says, has ever been Person of the Year two years in a row.\n\nAt the time, Mr Murray took to his own Twitter feed to set the record straight, but he says this entertaining saga is emblematic of a more serious attack on the press in the US.\n\nBen Smith, editor in chief of what Donald Trump has termed a\"failing pile of garbage\", otherwise known as Buzzfeed News, agrees.\n\n\"For any given media outlet, being attacked by the President of the United States for an accurate story that he is unhappy with, draws attention to that story, draws attention to your reporting,\"he says.\n\nIt also, in the case of Buzzfeed, helps shift some tongue-in-cheek merchandise -\"failing pile of garbage\"T-shirts and bumper stickers.\n\n\"The sum, though, of the president and his allies' attacks on the idea of a legitimate press is incredibly damaging.\"\n\n'Failing at failing'\n\nFor Elisabeth Bumiller, Washington bureau chief of the New York Times and a veteran White House watcher, the best response to such attacks is robust journalism, which, she claims, is serving her newspaper well.\n\n\"I think globally we are seen as very tough on the president,\"she says, when asked about what the Oval Office has done for the Gray Lady's reputation (as the New York Times is known).\n\n\"He refers to us constantly as the failing New York Times,\"an exhausted Ms Bumiller adds.\n\n\"I like to say that the failing New York Times is even failing at failing, and we have record high readership and interest.\"\n\nMr Murray's publications are also doing well - Time Inc (soon to be subsumed into Meredith Corp) attracts 140 million unique visitors to its sites a month, and its print magazines still have the power to create international headlines.\n\nBut he cautions that increasingly, links to stories by Time and Fortune on social media are indistinguishable from less trustworthy - or even downright fake - news outlets.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, he says, may be a bigger cause of upheaval for the US media than Donald Trump. \n\n\"Facebook and Google to some extent have helped lead the confusion that people have about what can be trusted and what can't,\"he says, echoing a warning from billionaire investor George Soros, issued at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe answer, he says, lies in good old-fashioned branding. \n\n\"There have to be strong brands that people trust and believe in, in order for them to get news they can feel confident in,\"he says, adding that appearing to be fair and impartial is vital to this endeavour.\n\n\"Branding is basically a shortcut to trust\"\n\n'Trends on our side'\n\nBuzzfeed News, which piggy-backed on a popular online entertainment brand, has been growing too, both in stature and audience.\n\nBut although the company recently announced layoffs and a broad restructuring plan, Ben Smith says he is\"optimistic about the business of news,\"particularly when it comes to the digital media.\n\n\"The underlying trends - the shift towards social media, the shift towards mobile consumption are on our side,\"he says.\n\nAnd what of the bogeyman of many an online newsroom, Mark Zuckerberg?\n\n\"We are less dependent on Facebook than we were a year, or two years, or three years ago,\"says Mr Smith, defiantly.\n\nThe former Politico writer is also less pessimistic than many in his industry about the proposed changes to Facebook's news feed, which would make posts from businesses, brands and media less prominent, under the guise of cracking down on fake news outlets.\n\nBut did executives from the Silicon Valley giant consult Buzzfeed - after all a driver of huge amounts of interaction on social media networks - about the tectonic shift in Facebook's algorithm?\n\nMr Smith chuckles:\"If only\".\nTL;DR: The Donald giveth, and the Donald taketh away.\n\nArticle: The additional cost, for fixing engines in the United States, takes the total bill to $30bn. \n\nTwo years after the problems first emerged, Volkswagen is still struggling to put the crisis behind it.  \n\nSeparately Munich prosecutors made an arrest in connection with the scandal.\n\nGerman media reports have named the person taken into custody as Wolfgang Hatz, former board member at VW unit Porsche.

What did\"the big society\"even mean?\n\nBut Mr Cameron was deadly serious - and eight months down the line, far from being quietly dropped as some assumed, or hoped, it might be, the big society is being pursued with surprising vigour across Whitehall.\n\nEverything from proposals to\"mutualise\"post offices to a campaign to eradicate common ragwort from the British countryside have been talked up as examples of\"the big society in action\", as ministers and civil servants fall over themselves to show they are on board with the prime minister's favourite project.\n\nSome of this activity stems from a natural desire to please the new boss.\n\n\"There are things we are already doing we are trying to re-badge as big society - trying to show that they are in line with the big society,\"said one civil servant in a large Whitehall department, who did not want to be named.\n\nAnd there is still confusion among civil servants about what the big society actually means - despite an on-going series of seminars across Whitehall to explain it.\n\n'Impact'\n\nBut, according to Tony Blair's former policy chief, Matthew Taylor, a man familiar with the inner workings, and frustrations, of the government machine, there are signs that\"the big society\"is becoming more than just a\"passing fad\".\n\n\"What has been good is that they have stuck with the idea. It is not just a soundbite. It is something that they mean,\"he says.\n\n\"There are signs now of the idea starting to make an impact across government.\"\n\nWhen Tony Blair came to power in 1997 he also had a big idea that many struggled to understand - The Third Way. But it slowly died a death because nobody but Mr Blair had any real interest in it.\n\nCould the\"big society\"suffer a similar fate?\n\n\"The big society is not something which waxes and wanes depending on the popularity of David Cameron. In that sense, it is more successful than the Third Way,\"says Matthew Taylor.\n\n\"I think The Third Way had some good ideas, but people didn't really buy into it. In the end, it was just Tony Blair.\"\n\nLabour initially dismissed the big society idea as a con trick - a cynical attempt to slap a smiling face on savage spending cuts.\n\nBut cannier shadow ministers began to wonder whether they should be praising the big society, not burying it.\n\nAfter all, who could argue with being nicer to your neighbours? Or devoting more time to the community?\n\nNow Labour leader Ed Miliband says he is determined to claim the concept for his party.\n\nHe is putting together a team of advisers to explore how to breathe new life into local communities by strengthening local institutions such as post offices and libraries, rather than handing them over to volunteers.\n\nThe real test for\"the big society\", those on the left argue, is the impact it will have in poorer parts of the country, particularly when funding is being cut to many voluntary groups and community projects.\n\n\"If the big society is going to be powerful, its power must be felt in deprived communities,\"says Matthew Taylor, who is chief executive of The Royal Society of Arts.\n\nMr Cameron and the other architects of the concept represent relatively affluent constituencies, in rural areas, were there is a settled population and plenty of fit and active retired people with time on their hands for volunteering.\n\nIt is a very different story, argues Mr Taylor, in the inner cities, where the coalition's cuts are likely to hit the hardest - and where people often lack the confidence, or the spare time, to take over services such as libraries and community centres that might be facing closure.\n\nA former local government regeneration chief, who did not want to be named, put it more bluntly:\"The government are completely unrealistic about what it means to someone living on an inner city housing estate. They haven't got a bloody clue.\"\n\nLord Wei, the government's Mr Big Society - who described it as a\"coral reef\"in his maiden House of Lords speech - counters such criticism by pointing to the creation of the Big Society Bank, which will raid dormant bank accounts to provide up to \u00a3100m for community projects, from April.\n\nThere are also plans to despatch 5,000 community organisers into different parts of the country to try and get volunteers to work together more effectively.\n\nTrust\n\nBut critics say even voluntary groups and local authorities who genuinely want to get involved with the\"big society\", lack the funds to do so - and are struggling to work out what the concept really means, as ministers have been steadfast in their refusal to spell it out.\n\n\"For those who hunger for simplicity and for administrative tidiness, for there to be a White Paper which can kind of set out exactly what's going to happen, it's not going to be like that,\"said Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude when pressed for a definition on BBC Radio 4's PM programme.\n\n\"The result of a big, strong society is that it will be administratively untidy. People will come together to do things in different ways and different places.\"\n\nIn the end, it may come down to the willingness of civil servants and other professionals to trust the public, when handing over control of services, and in some cases funds, to groups of well-intentioned amateurs.\n\nInevitably, some of these groups will turn out to be bungling amateurs, but ministers say they are relaxed about this too.\n\nTory policy chief Oliver Letwin, giving evidence to a select committee last week, summed up the government's self-consciously upbeat philosophy.\n\n\"Our intuition is that people are more likely to do great things - to innovate, to make things better - if they have a great deal of scope for creativity and a great deal of ability to make things happen on the ground.\n\n\"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success.\"\n\nHe was talking about giving more freedom to public servants, but it might equally work as a definition of\"the big society\", at least until something more concrete begins to emerge.\n\nUnless, in what might be an example of the concept in action, you can think of a better one...\n\nHere is a selection of your comments:\n\nMy wife has been replaced at our local hospital by a volunteer. Now we both have no income. If this is a by product of a\"big society\", then you can keep it.Chris, Norwich\n\nIsn't this just a case of putting a socially friendly brand name on a concept that's already in place? Take, for example, the Territorial Army, Special Constables & St. Johns Ambulance, Lifeguards, volunteer outreach workers etc. - These established volunteer groups have been around for a considerable time, and popularising them seems to be the key to the PM's budgeting. However, while the majority of Britain may be generous, giving etc., there has to be a fair balance. individuals offering more to a governemnt that has already demanded so much, might be pushing it just a bit too much, no matter how they dress it up.Mike, Essex\n\nOne would hope that a\"policy chief\"would have more sense than to say something as naive as\"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success.\"That would have been embarrassing even in his undergraduate speeches at Cambridge, some of which I sat through. Who pays the liability insurance for the bungling amateurs? Who monitors their standards? What happens if the more successful amateurs refuse to move to parts of the country where there are no services because all the locals bungled it?Ian, Biggleswade, UK\n\nThe'Big Society' already exists. The clever thing is that any social philanthropy will now appear as David Cameron's doing, part of his philosophy. And cleverer still, it allows deep cuts to be masked by a society where things still get done, but now for free. Whereas previously a society in recession would stagnate, now Mr Cameron's Eton classmates will enjoy a future of tax cuts because hordes of pensioners and unemployed public sector workers will be fixing your roads and cleaning your streets for free. Genius. How about a volunteer Government?Mark, Southampton\n\nIt is not surprising that the idea of the\"Big Society\"is gaining momentum in Whitehall because it has one brilliant political feature, when something does or does not happen, when something doesn't go well it is not the governments fault - it is the fault of everyone else - it is societies fault. You can just imagine Sir Humphrey explaining this to his minister... In truth the Big Society is a Chimera because it is just another way of describing what already exists, people doing things for the common good, paid and unpaid. What seems to have been forgotten is that a lot of people have made decisions that they would rather pay someone else to do that work than spend their own time organising or participating. In more affluent societies that's what happens with time poor individuals. So will the Big Society as conceived by Cameron lead to a patchwork of inefficient local initiatives that are totally inconsistent and doomed to failure in the long term as people loose interest and spend their time on other things?Steve, London\n\nOliver Letwin is quoted as saying,\"And as long as those who do it well succeed, and those who do it badly fail, you get an increasing drift towards success.\"That is all well and good as long as the failure is recognised. I would hate to see the government perpetually funding failed attempts at volunteers running services because they do not have the systems or checks in place to stop funding and replace the volunteers. As long as there is some sort of effective oversight for the Big Society then it can work. The big test will be the first couple of failures and how long it takes for someone to say,\"this isn't working.\"Jay, UK\n\nI think that the'Big Society' is something that everyone intrinsically understands from the point of view of'help your neighbour'. On our street we have an older couple who have lived here for several decades. When he went into hospital, she was given daily rides to see him, dinners and lots of support - it wasn't co-ordinated, people just felt the need to help.'London Citizens' is a good example - people band together to make positive changes such as'City Safe' which asks local businesses to become'Safe Havens' for youngsters threatened in the streets for example. I think that more people would get involved in the Big Society if they could quantify how it would positively affect their own environment and as such, should always be looked at from a local point of view.S Brethes, London\n\nCatchy phrase for a vague concept... that has actually been around for donkey's years and has a pretty patchy record. A threatened railway station was successfully taken over by a local private school, whilst a major plan to reopen a closed line has remained a plan for 30+years due to amateurs'playing with trains', plus lack of direction and council support. But perhaps the most relevant insight is from Matthew Taylor, as echoed on BBC Breakfast today. Taking over a library is easier if you're in an affluent area with plenty of middle aged, middle class do-gooders with too much time on their hands. It's only when this type of person is willing to give a bit more than patronising advice to the poorer section of society will we truly have a'Big' society.anglowelsh, Wales\n\nThe policy is total eyewash - it is just a cynical pretence that is meant to suggest that the Tories actually care about disadvantaged people.Arthur, South Shields\n\n\"The Big Society\"is only what vast numbers of people have been doing for decades in the UK. I am the eldest of 5 and my mother always used to say\"keep them busy and they stay out of mischief\"and we belonged to youth clubs, guides, scouts, st. john ambulance among many others and also did fund raising for large and small charities. It was never administered or organised, we just did what we fancied. And it meant TV was just a last resort when there was nothing else to do. I learnt all sorts of extra skills that have been a huge benefit and there is very little I regret in life now that I am in my 50s. There are loads of volunteering websites and they will be delighted to hear from you. Trust me - you get just as much out of it as you put into it.LP, South Wales\n\nI think Big Society is a big con. Yes, of course I wish more people would do more for their communities - give time to charities, be volunteers for this and that. But it is NO SUBSTITUTE for properly run, properly resourced public services. And I have no doubt whatsoever that it is an attempt to get things that should be good quality public services on the cheap. In many cases this will result in poorer, piecemeal services with untrained and unsupported staff. In the worst case this is potentially dangerous. Yes, if BS means a branch library that would have closed can remain open, then I'm all for it. If it means that challenging young people with complex needs on an education project get either no input or input by dangerously untrained and unsupervised volunteers (which I think is the kind of thing that is going to happen) then I most definitely am not.Penny, Devon\n\nI chair a local Community Group, all volunteers and not for profit. We provide exercise activities for disabled children in our area. We function pretty much how I understand the Big Society should do - volunteers running services well and being provided with funds to do so from the public purse. Unfortunately the public purse only has cobwebs in it now - the public bodies who used to fund our work are being discontinued and can no longer fund us. Private business, who Mr Cameron assures us will mount the white charger and come to our rescue? Let's just say that they aren't falling over themselves to help. The few who do respond point out (quite fairly) that charity begins at home and they're not making much profit right now. I'm sure that we're just one of hundreds of similar stories nationwide. You already had a Big Society Mr Cameron, you've just taken away their ability to provide services and replaced it with woolly words and empty promises.S Ward, Nottingham\n\nMaybe senior Conservatives had their local communities in rural villages in Buckinghamshire or Wiltshire in mind when they came up with the big society... where mutualising the local post office and protecting farmland diversity are big issues and where people might endeavour to take on these things if given the chance in an official way... but in Lewisham, round me, I just don't see that happening. This whole notion is based around a small, close-knit and familiar community of small rural towns and villages... not the large informal ones of inner cities.Jack, London\n\nIts about getting retired old busy bodies with nice comfortable pensions and time on their hands to take on the jobs of those younger less fortunate members of society who have no jobs, pensions and indeed no future, sacked as a consequence of the spending cuts imposed by this Tory government. It conjures up twee visions of England gone by, the village fete, tea parties, cricket on the green, Dad's Army and the Vicar of Dibley when the reality will be Dickensian levels of poverty, ill-health and social division.Ian, Marske by the Sea, Cleveland\n\nI wonder how long it took Conservative think tanks or advertising people to come up with the name The Big Society after studying Green Party or Liberal Party policy over the last 40 years. Whatever the answer, the Big Society should be embraced as a means to bring back the human scale to communities.Tom, Chester\n\nThe purpose of the Big Society is to offload Government and Local Authority spending, by delegating it to unpaid volunteers. As a Parish Councillor, I'm seeing this\"on the ground\". However, some of this is simply not possible. Would you want a willing neighbour, with no knowledge of Civil Engineering, to patch the frost-blown holes in your road? If the neighbour botches it, which is more than likely, who would the insurance claim from - the Parish Council, the neighbour, or the senior Local Authorities whose delegation led to the situation? Sounds unreasonable? Our County Council is rumoured to want us to take over road repair in our Parish, but without giving us the cash to do it. That alone would probably empty the Parish coffers, including the coming Precept funds, in less than a year. Step up, the Big Society. Anyone know how to fix a street light?Jon, Cambridge\n\nIn my current position, I visit several Citizens Advice Bureaux. Each one is a registered charity which relies heavily on volunteers and is part funded through local authority funds and part through Legal Services Commission. Each and every one are currently going through redundancy procedures with their paid staff (support and administration mainly) because local authorities are struggling to find monies. By 2012, the LSC are looking to remove all legal aid except for the most severe cases (e.g. actual homelessness - not threatened, loss of liberty, threat to life). There will be no money to employ caseworkers to deal with debt problems, benefit enquiries, employment issues etc. There is a serious risk that some Bureaux will close completely. Whilst the\"Big Society\"seems to be a clear and welcome effort, it cannot succeed if the basic infrastructure (i.e. Charities and NfP organisations) no longer exists.Simon, Oldham\n\nWhy doesn't someone just say that the Big Society is what we're going to need if the vacuum left by a decimated Big Government is left unfilled. It's going to be administratively untidy because the Conservatives want nothing to do with it, nor do they want their affluent supporters to pay for the administration or regulation of it. The Big Society is being dressed up as developing civil society for rhetorical reasons - like we are supposed to blame ourselves if there are social problems caused by removing the welfare state. We have a civil society - that's what makes us civilised - and I like contributing to its upkeep by giving some of the time spent doing my own job (in which I have skills) in the form of taxes to other people who are skilled at doing their jobs.Dominic, Darlington\n\nSo, as far as I can see, the government expect the tax-payers to volunteer to do the things their taxes are paying for. Really - who in this country can afford to work for free? I certainly can't. And running something as important as a library is a full-time job for multiple people. And requires skill and experience. Voluntary work isn't free - it costs money to run it. So those twits in government think we should pay for the privilege running these services as well as working for free. It can't possibly work, it will never take off. And while I am paying taxes for a service I expect the government to supply it - or give me my money back.Sandy, Derby\n\nThe sort of behaviour needed to create the big society is part of Britain's culture, or not. Government can influence and encourage this sort of change in culture but it will take many years. The idea that this can take up the slack from cuts in funding to public services in the next 12 months is fantasy.JWN1961, Peterborough\n\nThe\"Big Society\"is communitarianistic nonsense and should be treated as the individual squashing, fabianistic bilge it really is. Want to see more voluntary work Mr. Cameron? Stop robbing half my income or putting it on the shoulders of my children and grandchildren in the form of inter-generational debt.Thom, Leeds\n\nIt is a blatant attempt to dismantle a system which guarantees a right to all citizens to have a minimum standard of living. This consists not only of the basics of food and shelter but libraries and museums and universities which don't cripple even the slightly better off for years ahead. I am one of the\"do-gooders\"who donate time to the local community and have done this willingly - and will continue to do so without financial reward - but I see this as over and above the provision of basic services. Charities are struggling to raise enough funds to keep going... I don't want to rely on the whims of local\"do-gooders\"to provide basic services. Britain is following the lead of America and I, for one, despair.Hazel, Dartington\n\nAsk not what the Big Society can do for you...Since I work full time, leave the house at 7 and get home at 6 (and I'm sure many people are out of the house longer hours) I have 1 1/2 hours in the evening with my children before their bed time. The weekends are family time. What does the Big Society want from me?RJ, London\n\nAt last we have a government mantra which actually resonates with the people! If it hadn't taken root the idea would have been dropped by now in line with similar schemes raised by other governments. Now we need to see if Labour will accept that this is a\"good idea\"from the Conservatives and not just claim it for Labour's own political ends which has been their tendency over the last few years. If Labour takes that step into line, the concept can really take hold across society and we can start to\"put the people back in government\". We don't need party political bickering, we need to just get on with it, especially when the financial situation is predicating total commitment from the country.Michael, Warboys\n\nI think the Labour party is being too pessimistic. Having worked with groups such as young carers I know that there are a large number of people who are very willing to give up there time for others. I know many readers genuinely care for their communities and posses a drive to help others, I can't foresee any problem in getting volunteers into inner city areas.Edward, Ampleforth\n\nBig Society in my area means the choice at Parish Council level of losing your services in the rural areas, or paying more on the Parish council tax to keep them. This equates to paying for services twice, once for local areas and again for the nearby towns where the same services are to be kept. We have seen this in our libraries already. Rural residents are now being asked to pay more to keep their local library, as well as continuing to pay for the council run ones that they cannot travel to.john, IOW\n\nThis sounds really bad - has nobody else noticed this is rather similar to the DoSac Fourth Sector Initiative from the TV series The Thick of It? Has Cameron been secretly writing scripts for the BBC?Paul, Reading\n\nOur high street is already run to a great deal by volunteers. The result: Constant decline. Volunteers don't earn money they can spend in shops. The shops have less to invest. Business tax income for the council goes down. An economy in crisis needs proper jobs, properly paid, not its main commodity, services (in the absence of manufacturing), being taken over by volunteers.Arnim Friess, Leamington Spa\n\nThe big problem I have with the Big Society, as does the charity I am co-chair of, is that the phrase is being used day after day, but us at the coal face of running a charity have no idea, have been sent no information and cannot find any information on the Big Society! Are we supposed to be psychic to work out what it's all about? We've been planning how the charity can assist, but with no information, it's trying to find a small tiny needle in a huge haystack!Dan, London, UK\n\n'Big Society' - aren't these the things that local government, local NHS etc used to do before they were encouraged to perform like'Big Business'? And don't volunteers and the local community already do more than their fair share in, for example, providing hospice care? This is certainly the case here in Cornwall. I'm afraid, Mr Cameron, that your vision of the'Big Society' merely asks those of us fund-raising to introduce or maintain what should be basic health care (hospice care, care for sufferers of multiple sclerosis, ongoing breast cancer care, oncological services) to do more to replace what we always assumed our tax and National Insurance were supposed to provide.

Praising the temperature checks at the airport and extra measures in the local hotels, he said:\"whoever wants to go on holiday to Majorca has to help ensure there's no new outbreak.\"\n\nQuieter nightlife as the clubs stay silent\n\nAlthough flights to Majorca are expected to reach levels of 30% to 40% of a normal summer, the atmosphere at Palma Beach is set to remain considerably more sedate than other years. Mr Ferrer accepts that the Covid-19 effect will accelerate the existing tendency towards less nightlife and more daytime experiences. \n\nIn June the Balearic Islands government announced that nocturnal excesses would not be a part of this summer.\n\nThere are strict rules limiting opening times and conditions in pubs and clubs, and nightclubs are banned from operating at all in Magaluf and Palma Beach on Majorca as well as Sant Antoni on Ibiza - the resorts that have become notorious for so-called\"booze tourism\".\n\n\"There won't be that kind of mass tourism because those places are not going to open; it's a clear message,\"says Iago Negueruela, the Balearic minister for the economy, labour and tourism.\n\n\"We had already started a process and it is irreversible. The pubs won't open this year. We are no longer going to receive or tolerate that kind of tourist, who can be a risk for themselves and others.\"\n\nMr Negueruela highlights the law against\"tourism of excesses\"that his government introduced at the start of the year, banning pub crawls and happy hours. \n\nEnd of an era for'booze tourism'?\n\nThe current situation can only accelerate the end of what he says is a mere remnant of a bygone age, the minister argues.\n\n\"Our hotel sector has already staked out its preference for quality and not just numbers, but the perception does not always accompany the reality. Even in Magaluf, a transformation has been taking place, with a focus on five-star hotels, its beaches and gastronomy.\"\n\nIndustry leaders recognise that Covid-19 may make crowding a taboo for all future visitors. \n\n\"Some elements of this crisis might be temporary, like face masks,\"says Andreu Serra, tourism chief for the Mallorca Council island administration.\"But this is also an opportunity to improve our care of tourists, by using technology to control numbers so we know when beaches will be full, and generally boosting hygiene in all hospitality areas.\"\n\nTime to turn away from tourism?\n\nNot everyone is sighing in relief at the return of tourists to Majorca and the other islands.\n\nLocal environmentalists criticise the over-dependence on a sector that has transformed the archipelago's landscape, while creating employment that is largely low-paid and seasonal in nature as property prices and even rents skyrocket beyond the means of most employees.  \n\nFor Antoni Pallicer Mateu, a member of publishing collective Tot Incl\u00f2s that aim to inform on tourism's impact on the islands, Balearic citizens and in particular Majorcans have become prisoners to a sector\"that is so vulnerable to instability\"and whose use of resources is such that almost all other needs have to be imported.\n\n\"Now it's a pandemic, but in the near future it could be a climate or energy crisis, or simply a crisis in our main markets of Germany and the UK,\"argues Mr Pallicer Mateu.\n\n\"Tourism benefits tour operators, agencies, hotel chains, rental companies like Airbnb, and also a Majorcan middle class who own property and companies. But it is benefiting the working class and small businesses less and less. Mass tourism is driving us towards unsustainability and an environmental and even social collapse.\" \n\nIn the Balearic high season, the population of the islands usually doubles due to tourism, as the one million residents are matched by a million tourists. Little wonder, then, that registered unemployment in May was double the normal amount for that month, at 75,000.\n\n\"We have tourism dependency, and we will for another 15 years at least, because no other alternative has been developed,\"says Mr Ferrer, noting that the non-services part of the economy only covers 15% of Balearic GDP.\n\n\"It's a moment of political opportunity to criticise tourism right now, but that's what is paying people's wages every month,\"Mr Ferrer continues.\n\n\"I doubt many of our waiters and waitresses who have been out of work these past few months would subscribe to this point of view.\"\nTL;DR: As Spain scrambles to save its vital tourism industry from the threat of a blank year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some sense an opportunity to change perceptions about Spanish holidays and start a move upmarket that has been long on the agenda.\n\nArticle: He is accused of taking $5m (\u00a33.2m) in bribes to secure contracts with the state oil giant, Petrobras. \n\nMr Cunha denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated.

All groups had to ensure they met campaign spending rules and filed accurate returns under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.\n\nWho are Leave.EU?\n\nThe Electoral Commission said Leave.EU had exceeded the spending limit for\"non-party registered campaigners\"by at least 10% by failing to include at least \u00a377,380 in its spending return - the fee paid to campaign organiser Better for the Country Ltd - and added the overspend\"may well have been considerably higher than that\".\n\nIts spending return also did not include services Leave.EU had received from a US campaign strategy firm, Goddard Gunster, and the group\"inaccurately reported\"three loans totalling \u00a36m from Mr Banks - including who had provided them - and did not provide invoices or receipts for 97 separate payments, totalling \u00a380,224. \n\nThe Commission has referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police, saying it had reasonable grounds to suspect she had committed criminal offences over campaign spending.  \n\nBob Posner, the Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said spending rules were in place to ensure public confidence in democracy and it was\"disappointing that Leave.EU, a key player in the EU referendum, was unable to abide by these rules\".\n\n\"These are serious offences. The level of fine we have imposed has been constrained by the cap on the Commission's fines,\"he added.\n\n'Ignored completely'\n\nBut Mr Banks told the BBC's Daily Politics that Leave.EU had responded to the Commission with a 20-page report from an independent accountant which, he said, the watchdog had\"ignored completely\".\n\nHe described the disputed amount as\"an internal management charge which our lawyers have told us wasn't reportable\"and claimed the Commission was staffed by pro-Remainers and the ruling was politically motivated.\n\n\"Effectively what they have done is, they started off their investigation with a remit of investigating Cambridge Analytica and dark Russian money - they have found no evidence of any of those things and they have fined us on a technical accounting issue which is heavily in dispute.\"\n\nMr Banks said they intended to challenge the finding in court.\n\nElectoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett denied claims of bias made by Mr Banks.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:\"The decisions were made by directors of the Electoral Commission, they were made based on robust evidence we had gathered, and indeed you can see that in the 30-page report that we published.\"\n\nLeave.EU is not the only group to fall foul of spending rules in the EU Referendum campaign. The Lib Dems were fined \u00a318,000 and the official Remain campaign was fined \u00a31,250 by the Commission last year.\n\nThe official Vote Leave group - that was backed by cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - is still under investigation. The pro-EU European Movement UK and UKIP have also been fined over their referendum spending.\n\nThe maximum fine is \u00a320,000 per offence - Leave.EU was fined for four separate offences.\nTL;DR: Campaign group Leave.EU has been fined \u00a370,000 for breaches of election law in the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nArticle: At present, people must\"opt in\"by registering to donate their organs for transplants after they die.\n\nUnder the new system it will be assumed people were in favour of donation unless they have stated otherwise.\n\nOnly a handful of MSPs voted against the plans, which Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick said would help contribute to\"significant increases in donation and transplantation\".\n\nApproximately 550 people in Scotland are waiting for an organ transplant, which could save or transform their lives.\n\nDespite record numbers of people registered to donate, it is hoped the move to an opt-out system - similar to the one  adopted by Wales in 2015 - will lead to an increase in available organs. \n\nFamilies will still be consulted and have the final say under the plans in the Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Bill. \n\nDavid McColgan, of the British Heart Foundation Scotland, said: \"We already have the highest population registered to be donors [in the UK] but we also have the highest family refusal rate so this legislation will change that conversation, change the understanding of the situation. \n\n\"For example, in Wales over two years they have seen a 50% increase in family consent so that is really important and that is what we hope the legislation will achieve here. \n\n\"But the legislation cannot be seen as a silver bullet and a solution on its own, so two of the big challenges which exist are training enough staff and having the suitable infrastructure for transplants.\"\n\nMore than half of Scotland's population have registered to donate their organs or tissue after their death - the highest rate in Britain.\n\nMr Fitzpatrick said the bill was part of a range of measures aimed at boosting donations, saying it was\"important that we do all we can to improve the lives of those on the waiting list\".\n\nHe said:\"Organ and tissue donation can be a life-changing gift. Evidence shows that opt-out systems can make a difference as part of a wider package of measures and this bill provides further opportunities to both save and improve lives.\"\n\nHolyrood considered an opt-out system in the previous parliamentary term, but narrowly rejected a member's bill from Labour's Anne McTaggart due to\"serious concerns\"about the\"practical impact of the specific details\".\n\nThree MSPs voted against the current bill, with one - SNP backbencher Christine Grahame - voicing concerns about the wording of the bill.\n\n'Another shot at life'\n\nStudying for his Highers in 2011, 16-year-old Harry Prentice could not shake a breathlessness and lethargy which left him falling asleep at all times of the day.\n\nWithin minutes of a visit to his GP, he was on his way to hospital and the eventual diagnosis was that his heart was twice the size it should be, and failing.\n\n\"It was a shock, I was a 16-year-old guy - fit as a fiddle - and thought I was fine, invincible like you do at that age,\"explained Harry.\n\nThe new norm for Harry, who lives near Lanark, was then endless journeys to and from hospital as he waited for a heart transplant. \n\nHe continued:\"Once you're on the waiting list it really makes you think about the situation you're in - you think, am I going to be here in five years time? And so you start thinking about your life and what is planned.\"\n\nHarry was fitted with an an artificial heart pump which allowed him to continue with life for two years until further complications developed. He was eventually found a transplant in June 2013 with the team operating from the Golden Jubilee hospital in Clydebank. \n\nComplications during surgery meant Harry suffered a severe stroke and has had years of rehabilitation since, but the 24-year-old says he is delighted the transplant has given him another shot at life. \n\nHe said:\"There was relief when the news came through and a little bit of sadness knowing someone had died, but grateful they had decided to donate and that they were going to pass on the organs to let me live. \n\n\"This law change has been a long time in the waiting and will be good for the country.\"\nTL;DR: MSPs have voted to approve an \"opt-out\" system for organ donation in Scotland.\n\nArticle: By Claire BatesBBC News\n\n\"Safe, bareback babymaking,\"the advert read.\n\n\"I'm in my 30s & have given up on Messrs Right & Wrong. I want a baby.\"\n\nThe request was posted on Craigslist, a website better known for second-hand goods.\n\nThe potential father needed to be over 5ft 9in, under 40 and prepared to take an STD test. He would also be required to have\"a few days of frequent sex\".\n\nJessica makes no apology for her businesslike approach.\n\n\"Our grandparents didn't spend years and years cohabiting and watching boxsets,\"she says.\n\n\"Starting a family was very much the goal of their endeavour.\"\n\nShe'd also watched many of her friends start families after falling\"madly in love\", only to split up later in a cloud of angry recriminations.\n\n\"I decided I could sacrifice romantic fulfilment as long as my child had two parents who loved and cared for them,\"she says.\n\nShe posted her advert on Craigslist while on a bus from her home in the suburbs into central London - and by the time she arrived at Oxford Street, she already had a number of replies. \n\nShe set up a meeting with the most promising one that very evening. \n\nFind out more\n\nJessica spoke to the Emma Barnett Show on BBC 5 live\n\nYou can listen again here (start at 38 minutes 50 seconds)\n\nA year earlier, Jessica had been in a long-term relationship with David. Like her, he wanted children... but he was in no rush.\n\n\"He was aimless. He wanted to wait until he felt better about his life and his career. You just think,'Come on!'\"Jessica says.\n\nShe had wanted children since she turned 30 and was envious of friends who were starting families. She was also shaken by a visit to her aunt in hospital. Her aunt didn't have children, and Jessica believed she had been ignored by doctors as there had been no-one to insist on better care.\n\n\"I thought there was a risk of me ending up in a similar situation if I had no kids of my own. They can act as insurance for when you get older.\"\n\nShe ended her relationship with David in March 2016 and almost immediately started dating her colleague, Scott. He was keen to have a baby, but after six months of trying they had nothing to show for it. So they went to a GP, who suggested blood tests - and while Jessica's results were clear, Scott's revealed a range of fertility issues.\n\n\"He didn't react well to the news and basically fell apart. I didn't feel I had the ability to support him through it,\"Jessica says.\"Also I didn't really want to go through IVF.\"\n\nThey split up after a make-or-break Christmas holiday in 2016.\n\nJessica then spoke to a gynaecologist, who suggested artificial insemination using donor sperm. Jessica wanted her child to have a caring father, so she wasn't keen on the idea, but she discussed it with a friend anyway.\n\n\"She asked,'Why would you spend \u00a3700 for sperm when you could go down to Yates's [wine bar] and find someone who would gladly give you it for free?'\"Jessica says. \n\n\"But I didn't want to go to a pub and have unprotected sex with someone who'd had no STD checks. I also didn't want to entrap someone into parenthood.\"\n\nHowever, this prompted her to post an advert on a co-parenting website. Scrolling through the potential fathers, she came across quite a few married gay couples, but feared she'd lose out as one among three parents.\n\n\"I was worried a 50-50 split would soon become 70-30 in their favour,\"she says.\n\nShe then started chatting to a single man on the website, until an insurmountable barrier got in the way - Brexit.\n\n\"He voted to leave Europe and I'm very much for remain,\"Jessica says.\"I said,'I'm not really sure we can parent like this.'\"\n\nJessica quit the website, which charged a monthly fee, and considered dating apps. But as a teacher she didn't want to post a photograph of herself. Then she thought about Craigslist.\n\n\"I didn't want to use a dating website or Tinder in case a student saw a picture of me. Plus I knew Craigslist got a lot of traffic and was free to use,\"she says.\n\nShe typed out her advert on the bus to Oxford Street last March, and posted it in the personals section.\n\n\"I don't use turkey basters when cooking and am not using one at conception,\"one line read.\n\n\"God, it sounds completely crazy looking back,\"Jessica says.\n\nShe didn't set many parameters for the potential father of her child, only height, age and sexual health.\n\n\"I just wanted to meet a good person with shared values,\"she says.\n\nShe received a flurry of replies, including the obligatory slew of penis pictures. A number of men wrote claiming they had helped several women, which turned Jessica off.\n\n\"The last thing I needed was for my child to end up at a party and snog their sibling without knowing,\"Jessica says.\n\nAnother young man wrote to say he was desperate for a baby after his previous partner had a miscarriage. Jessica felt he was too vulnerable.\n\nThen she received an email from Ross.\n\n\"He was 33 and also lived in London. He said he'd had some disastrous relationships but he loved being an uncle and wanted children of his own,\"Jessica says.\n\nThey agreed to meet for drinks that evening.\n\n\"I thought he was much better-looking in person than the photo he sent,\"she says.\n\nThey discovered they were of different faiths but agreed they wanted a\"London approach\"to religion.\n\n\"We agreed there was one God who loved pretty much everybody and we would want a child to be comfortable with people of any faith or no faith.\"\n\nJessica and Ross kissed at the end of their first meeting.\"I felt very comfortable around him,\"she says.\n\nA few days later they had dinner and arranged to have STD checks. After their fourth date they decided to have sex, to see if they were physically compatible.\n\n\"It was really good,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"We decided to start trying for a baby, knowing it could take a while.\"\n\nBut within weeks Jessica was holding a positive pregnancy test. She had conceived during her very next cycle.\n\n\"I found out I was pregnant about six weeks after I'd posted the advert,\"Jessica says.\"That was a bit of a surprise. It definitely wasn't what I had expected.\"\n\nThere hadn't even been time for Ross to get a sperm count.\n\nThey didn't have a written contract but agreed they wouldn't sleep with anyone else.\n\n\"I didn't want to label what my relationship with Ross was,\"Jessica says.\"I was delighted I was pregnant but I was wary that might make me think I was in love with him.\"\n\nYou may also like:\n\nWhy don't I want to have sex with the man I love?\n\nHollie McNish: The things new mothers aren't always told\n\nWhy I chose to donate my eggs\n\nRoss was very involved during the pregnancy and accompanied Jessica to hospital appointments. It wasn't all plain sailing, though.\n\nThey clashed about who got to keep the original ultrasound pictures and whether to spend money finding out the sex of the baby early.\n\nHowever, this led Jessica to an unexpected discovery. She had advertised for a father for her baby rather than a partner, but the quarrels made her realise that she actually had feelings for Ross.\n\n\"I realised being angry with him made me sad, as I did love him.\n\n\"But I was concerned that perhaps he was caring and attentive just because I was carrying his baby.\"\n\nThe couple told their parents Jessica was expecting a baby after the pregnancy had lasted 12 weeks, but didn't reveal how they had met.\n\n\"Our families get on well. It may be because there was a child involved but everyone was very accepting and tolerant of each other,\"Jessica says.\n\nJessica had been living alone and Ross moved in two months before their baby was due.\n\nShe had a Caesarean after her baby was found to be in a breech position, and spent a week recovering in hospital.\n\n\"Ross slept on a sleeping bag on the floor next to me the whole time. There was another dad there but he lasted one night before he said it was too uncomfortable and went home.\"\n\nHaving a newborn baby has left Jessica and Ross\"bone-achingly tired\".\n\nHowever, Jessica thinks that if anything their relationship has got stronger.\n\n\"We're coping and getting through it - maybe it's because we don't have the energy to argue!\"\n\nJessica is on maternity leave and Ross can work some days from home. It means they share a lot of the parenting duties.\n\n\"It's great, when there is a particularly icky nappy, being able to hand the baby over to dad and say,'This is yours,'\"Jessica says.\n\nThe couple have now been together just under a year and parents for two months. They are still discovering new things about each other.\n\n\"Like the other day in a text conversation I found out he liked Billie Holiday,\"Jessica says.\n\n\"It's great when we get time together and we always have a meal when he gets back from work. We enjoy being together and it makes it easier raising a child.\"\n\nThey have already discussed having another.\n\nJessica says she is pleased she went down an unconventional route to starting a family.\n\n\"I don't regret the advert,\"she says.\n\n\"I don't think you can get what you want by sitting there patiently and waiting for it to land in your lap.\"\n\nAll names have been changed\n\nClaire Bates is tweeting @batesybates\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.\n\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\nTL;DR: Ten months ago, thirty-something Jessica was eager to get pregnant. A series of relationships had failed so she tried a radically new approach - she posted an advert online. The outcome turned out to be far better than she had hoped.\n\nArticle: By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter\n\nCloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. \n\nThe 21-year-old suspect in this weekend\u2019s shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. \n\nPreviously, the site was also used by the suspect in March\u2019s shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. \n\nLosing Cloudflare\u2019s protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. \n\nA few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. \n\nHowever, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has\"a proven commitment to liberty\". \n\nBitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017.\n\nThe BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline.\n\nCloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. \n\nHowever, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post that\"8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate\u201d. \n\n\u201cThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,\u201d Mr Prince wrote.  \n\n\"Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.\u201d \n\nMr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflare\u2019s decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. \n\n\u201cThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,\u201d Mr Prince wrote. \n\n\"That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process.\n\nHe added:\"I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. \n\n\"In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internet\u2019s.\u201d \n\nHow do Cloudflare and BitMitigate services work?\n\nThe two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users.\n\nThey can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks.\n\nThey use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. \n\nThey can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. \n\nThey are meant to block any attempts from\"bad\"traffic getting through.\n\nCloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year.\n\nChief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concern at the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. \n\n8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. \n\nMr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflare\u2019s announcement, he wrote on Twitter:\"Thank you so much @CloudFlare Finally this nightmare might have an end.\u201d \n\n8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines. \n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Google exited China in 2010 over a censorship row.\n\nAnalysts said there could be challenges on the horizon, however, as Baidu's fourth quarter revenue projection came in below expectations.\n\nBaidu, which is listed in New York, said Monday revenue in the October to December period will range from 6.16-6.35bn yuan. Economists had estimated about 6.14bn yuan for that period.\n\nMobile growth\n\nBaidu itself acknowledged that it must manage its future mobile strategy  as more users shift from personal computers to mobile devices including smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe revenue generated from mobile search is far less than from PCs at the moment.\n\nIn October, Credit Suisse downgraded the company's outlook over concerns about how it would make money from its mobile search traffic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baidu chief executive, Robin Li, said the firms mobile search traffic was growing at triple digit rates.\n\n\"We are working hard to improve the monetisation system for mobile and to educate our customers to take full advantage of mobile,\"Mr Li told analysts on a conference call after the earnings announcement.\n\n\"But we expect it would take some time to close the gap,\"he added.\n\nBaidu also faces increased competition.

He has also said the criticism levelled against his government over the fires was\"disproportionate\".\n\nWhile the figures for October - traditionally a month when rains bring some relief - are particularly alarming, those for the year so far are also worrying environmentalists.  \n\nAccording to Inpe, 93,485 fires have been recorded in the Amazon so far this year - 25% more than in the same period in 2019, when President Bolsonaro's handling of the forest fires drew international condemnation.\n\nBrazil's Amazon region has been the hardest hit, with 46% of all blazes occurring there. \n\nBut environmentalists are also alarmed by the steep rise in fires in the Pantanal, one of the world's most biodiverse areas and home to animals such as the jaguar and the capuchin monkey.\n\nMariana Napolitano, the head of the science programme at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Brazil, told the AFP news agency that despite the four-month government-imposed ban on lighting fires, some of the blazes appeared to be man-made. \n\n\"After deforesting the jungle, the offenders set fires to clean up the accumulated organic material... At the end of the month, with the arrival of the rains, the pace of the fires seems to be slowing down, but we can hardly depend on climate factors,\"she warned.\n\n\"What happened in the dry season in the Amazon and Pantanal cannot be repeated,\"she added. \n\nYou may also be interested in:\nTL;DR: The number of fires blazing in Brazil's Amazon region in October 2020 was more than double those in the same month last year, satellite data suggests.\n\nArticle: The\"continuity bill\"has been tabled at Holyrood in case no deal is struck with UK ministers over the Westminster legislation and devolved powers.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the bill was unnecessary and that ministers should focus on hammering out a deal.\n\nBut MSPs backed an emergency process by 86 votes to 27.\n\nThat means MSPs will look at the bill over the next three weeks.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressed that\"we have not given up on seeking agreement with the UK government\", but said bringing forward the continuity bill was\"something that we required to do to protect the interests of the parliament\".\n\nThe bill is the latest stage in a row between the UK government and the devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff over post-Brexit powers.\n\nBoth of the devolved administrations are now bringing forward their own legislation, having warned that they will not put forward the EU Withdrawal Bill for consent votes unless a deal can be struck.\n\nThere has also been a row over whether the Scottish bill falls within Holyrood's remit, with the presiding officer arguing that it does not - but the Lord Advocate disagreeing.\n\nThe bill is being taken forward without the backing of the presiding officer - an unprecedented move for a government bill, and one which may leave it open to legal challenge in the Supreme Court.\n\nScottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell told MSPs the government supported having the\"maximum possible scrutiny\"of the legislation, but said an emergency timetable was\"necessary\"given the\"novel situation\".\n\nHe said Holyrood would be\"defenceless\"if the EU Withdrawal Bill were to pass without a continuity bill in place, saying the Scottish parliament\"must prepare itself to assert, if it has to, the right to legislate for itself the devolved consequences of EU withdrawal\".\n\n'No emergency'\n\nScottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins disagreed, saying that there did not need to be an emergency procedure because\"there is no emergency\".\n\nHe warned that rushing through the bill\"denies effective scrutiny\", saying that\"when we legislate in haste, we legislate in error\"- calling the move\"an invitation to make bad law, and make law badly\".\n\nScottish Labour's Neil Findlay also warned that scrutiny could be\"severely curtailed\"by a\"truncated\"parliamentary process, saying Labour had\"very serious concerns\"over the bill being considered only in the Holyrood chamber and not in committee.\n\nHowever, Labour MSPs ultimately backed the move, as did all members barring the Conservatives.\n\nThe first stage of consideration of the bill will take place on Wednesday 7 March, with the final vote scheduled two weeks later.\n\nFurther talks between the two governments are to continue, with ministers meeting in the coming week and Ms Sturgeon noting that a plenary session of the joint ministerial committee - traditionally attended by both herself and the prime minister - is currently scheduled for 14 March.\nTL;DR: MSPs have agreed an emergency timetable to rush through the Scottish government's alternative to the EU Withdrawal Bill.\n\nArticle: Bath MP Don Foster made the call after he organised a\"seagull summit\"for local authorities affected by the problem. \n\nA study carried out by Bristol University in 2010 found an estimated 1,100 pairs in Bath, 2,500 in Bristol and 2,900 in Gloucester.\n\nThe MP has called for a research fund to be created which would be supported by UK councils.\n\n'Oiling of eggs'\n\nMr Foster said:\"What I am proposing with a group of MPs is that we go to each of the councils that are affected who are already spending millions on this.\n\n\"If they put a small amount in over a three-year period, then we can get this research done.\"\n\nHe added that he had already lobbied government for the past five years to fund the research but his efforts had failed.\n\nThe MP has also said government research into gull numbers showed there were about 30,000 breeding pairs in the country but Bristol University findings led by seagull expert Peter Rock had estimated a much higher figure of 100,000 pairs.\n\n\"We simply don't know very much - the vast majority of research that's been done has been done on wild gulls living on cliff tops and so on.\n\n\"We've got very little on urban gulls and they are growing in number,\"explained Mr Foster.\n\n\"Despite all of the methods - everything from putting spikes on top of buildings, loud noises, bird scarers, oiling of eggs - none of them have worked and that's predominantly because we don't know enough about urban seagulls.\"\n\nA Defra spokeswoman said:\"We recognise that urban gulls can cause problems in some areas, which is why government enables local authorities to take action where there are public health issues.\"\nTL;DR: Further research is needed to curb gull populations in towns, an MP has said.\n\nArticle: Evelyn Crawford, 69, of Welland, died on Saturday after contracting the rare flesh-attacking bacterial infection necrotising fasciitis (NF). \n\nOn Thursday, she went to the walk-in centre in Peterborough's Thorpe Road and was told to take hay fever tablets.\n\nPeterborough NHS Trust said a review into what happened would take place.\n\nNecrotising fasciitis is a bacterial infection which attacks the soft tissue and can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nMrs Crawford had complained of a swollen face and lips and had difficultly opening her eyes. \n\nHer daughter found her slumped on the floor of her home on Friday and she was taken to hospital where she died in intensive care.\n\nMrs Crawford's son-in-law Steve Hammond said NF should have been diagnosed earlier.\n\nHe added:\"Anyone would look at her and say something was wrong, it was not hay fever, and you need to go and get proper medical treatment.\"\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nNHS Peterborough\n\nNecrotising fasciitis\nTL;DR: A review is taking place after a woman who was told she had hay fever died two days after visiting an NHS walk-in clinic. \n\n\n\nArticle: The watchdog says Unique International College misled students about loan repayments and the cost of courses, calling its conduct\"unconscionable\".\n\nMedia reports say it will ask the college to repay A$57m (40.6m; \u00a326.6m) in government funding.\n\nThe college has not yet commented.\n\nA claim against the college has been filed in the federal court following an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and New South Wales Fair Trading.\n\nAccording to a statement on the ACCC's website, the college enrolled more than 3,600 students in diploma courses during the 2014-15 financial year, which earned it A$57m in government funding.\n\nBut fewer than 3% of students graduated in the second half of last year. \n\n'Misleading or deceptive'\n\nThe ACCC alleges that college sales agents went door-to-door and offered free laptops as an incentive to sign up for online courses.\n\nMany of the people it targeted were from Aboriginal communities in some of the most disadvantaged areas of New South Wales.

They can relate to how they were at the start.\"\n\n'Made sense'\n\nThe contract sees Tinchy's management company Takeover Entertainment and Jay-Z's team Roc Nation begin a new project - aimed at breaking new talent. \n\n\"I've got my ears open. There's always something new around, you've just got to find out what's right and how it's going to work,\"outlines Tinchy. \n\n\"When it started we went over there [the US] a few times for a few meetings and they come over here.\n\n\"Everything just made sense. It wasn't quick. It was well thought out and we went through the deals. \n\n\"When you get along with someone away from music as well, you can just know that relationship is correct and right. Simple as that.\"\n\nMeeting Beyonce\n\nAlthough the deal was announced today, Tinchy sealed the contract when he met Jigga in Manchester on Monday where the Brooklyn star was kicking off his latest UK tour. \n\n\"He's just such a cool guy, he's so humble,\"added Tinchy. \n\n\"The way he explains things to you it just makes so much sense. He's been in the game so long, he's educated in the smallest little things.\"\n\nJay-Z's wife Beyonce was also there when the pair spent time together earlier in the week. \n\n\"Just chilling in the dressing room,\"he notes. \n\n\"She's cool as well - down to earth.

And her baby was taken away before she could say goodbye. \n\nHer family believes the baby was buried with someone else but they were never told where.\n\nCommunal plot \n\nAfter tracing a baby for a friend, Paula Jackson set up a website offering to help other families. \n\nIn the past 15 years, she has helped to trace nearly 800 babies through her charity Brief Lives Remembered.\n\nYvonne, one of the women Paula has helped, gave birth to a stillborn son 40 years ago.\n\n\"Why didn't I hold him? Why didn't I look at him? It was too late, he'd gone,\"Yvonne said.\n\n\"All I had was a priest come to see me and to say that he will have a proper burial. Next morning - ready to go home, that was it.\"\n\nPaula said families were effectively asked to carry on as though nothing had happened.\n\n\"Fathers were often advised to hide any baby products at home to help with the healing process,\"she said.\n\n\"In some cases, men were also asked for money for the burial - some dads kept their receipt as their only memento.\n\n\"The bodies of babies were either cremated, buried in a communal plot or placed in the coffin of a woman who had recently passed away. \n\n\"This information was not always shared with either family.\"\n\nPaula said the women were kept in maternity wards, surrounded by mothers and their new babies, and in some instances were asked to breastfeed when others needed help. \n\nLeft gravestones\n\nIn some military cemeteries, each baby was given their own burial plot. \n\nAnd in Aldershot Military Cemetery - where Paula traced the first\"lost\"baby - each plot was identifiable by a green marker. \n\nSome families have now traced their babies and left gravestones.

An interlocutor for an interlocutor.\"\n\nBarristers for the next of kin argued that it not be admitted at all, because it was\"entirely untested and entirely unchallengeable\".\n\nThe coroner said she would look at\"what steps I can take in terms of punishing the witness for a breach of court direction\".\n\nLater, the court heard evidence by video link from Phil Russell who has lived in Canada since 1977.\n\nHe explained that as a 14-year-old boy he had run to Springfield Park during unrest on 9 August 1971, and witnessed the prolonged gunfire there later.\n\nHe testified that he believed two different Army units were firing at each other, with many people caught in the crossfire.\n\nMr Russell, now 62, is the brother of the late Gerard Russell who was shot and injured near the Henry Taggart base.\n\n'Lots of people getting shot at'\n\nTheir brother, Robert, has given evidence to the inquest about two different shooting incidents.\n\nPhil Russell only came forward to the inquest after he heard of the death of his brother earlier this year, and was informed that he could also give evidence.\n\nHe said he only realised how much his other brother, Robert, had seen when he saw a BBC News NI report.\n\n\"There were lots of people getting shot at that day,\"he said. \n\n\"It never occurred to me that I would have the right to make a statement.\"\n\nPhil Russell said he was taking shelter in the Springfield Park area with others when the deaths of Father Hugh Mullan and Frank Quinn took place on nearby waste ground.\n\nHe said the gunfire was coming from Army soldiers on the roofs of Springmartin flats and on nearby houses.\n\nThe witness said he was speaking to a man beside him who was hit and dropped to the ground.\n\nMoans of the wounded\n\nHe then described being under fire and lying between two walls in the Moyard area along with a woman and two small children.\n\nHe was adamant that they all believed the soldiers were systematically trying to kill them.\n\nMr Russell also described listening to the moans of the wounded on nearby waste ground, and believes he listened to some of them slowly dying.\n\nHe said he and the others escaped when it got dark, and they helped carry a wounded man to a nearby community centre.\n\nIn his statement, he said he believed gunfire from soldiers in Springmartin struck an apartment building in Moyard, and some rounds carried on towards the Army base some distance behind it.\n\nThis, he said, caused the soldiers in the base to return fire towards the same apartments, with some bullets passing on back towards Springmartin.\n\nHe felt the two units of soldiers had continued to fire inadvertently at each other for some time.\n\nA barrister for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) suggested that the locations Mr Russell identified would not have caused the soldiers to fire at each other.\nTL;DR: A so-called \"UVF interlocutor\" has failed to give evidence to the Ballymurphy inquest for the third consecutive

after hundreds ignored them earlier this year.\n\nBarry Island, Cardiff Bay and Swansea's SA1 waterfront saw large groups gather at the Easter bank holiday weekend.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Gilmer, urged people to remember\"restrictions are still in place\"if they were going out.\n\n\"Social distancing is still something we expect people to adhere to,\"she said.\n\n\"So, we're telling people to please adhere to the restrictions, be considerate and respectful and hopefully everyone can have a good time this weekend.\"\n\nThe force, she said, had worked closely with licence holders and councils to make places safe.\n\n\"There will be extra police officers and community support officers and partners out there,\"Ms Gilmer added.\n\n\"The vast majority of people have done the right thing for many months, but we have seen some instances of anti-social behaviour over the past few weeks in Swansea, Cardiff Bay and Barry Island.\n\n\"Our officers will be out on the ground at those locations where people like to visit and supporting people and reminding them of the behaviour that is expected of them.\"\n\nThe police have enforcement powers and can disperse people who are considered to be breaking the social-distance rules.\n\n\"We would prefer not to use those, we'd prefer to work with people to remind them the standards of behaviour which are expected to keep our environment safe,\"Ms Gilmer said.\nTL;DR: Extra police will be patrolling Covid-breach hotspots where people are expected to gather to enjoy the bank holiday weekend.\n\nArticle: Research published just before the first lockdown in March 2020 suggested young people in Wales had a\"very limited\"understanding of Welsh politics.\n\nAnalysts from Beaufort Research spoke to 148 participants including 14 to 17-year-olds, disengaged adults and foreign nationals.\n\nAmong the research it found there was:\n\nNevertheless the same researchers found that 72% of 16 to 17-year-olds did want the right to vote, compared with 12% against.\n\nAnd since then, the coronavirus pandemic has offered a whole new level of awareness of the differences in who makes the rules in different parts of the UK, with Google searches over the last 12 months in Wales alone showing how many more people tried to find out what specific rules applied in what nation.\n\nIn February, polling by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) and YouGov found 69% of 16 to 24-year-olds thought the Senedd elections were important - a higher proportion than in any other age group, except the over-65s.\n\n'We pay taxes but couldn't decide who spends them'\n\n\"From the age of just 16 you can legally give birth to a child and claim child tax credit, get married with parental consent, give consent to medical treatment

reporter competition entrant added,\"we even have to pay taxes, and yet we are prevented from electing the man or woman who decides how to spend them\". \n\n\"We still are being restrained from contributing to the choice of who is in charge of our country.\"\n\nGeorgie believes there is a general lack of understanding about politics and wants more to be done to change this in order for younger people to play a more significant part in the UK political system.\n\nShe feels more could be done in schools and colleges to educate people. \n\n\"We need to understand how votes work,\"she said.\n\n\"You need to be educated about the process of politics to be better informed and able to vote.\n\n\"There's so many different perspectives and you have to hear the wider views,\"she added.\n\n\"The debate that 16-year-olds should be allowed to vote has been around for many years, but now it is our turn to make it happen. \n\n\"There are well over a million 16-year-olds alone in the UK, and one way of many ways to start is if we managed to get them to start and sign a petition - surely that would get us noticed? \n\n\"That is the main point of this argument, to be noticed and have our say in our future. \n\n\"I recently turned 16. I strongly believe that anyone who is not classified as a minor [16-year-olds are not] should be given the opportunity to have their voice heard in a legal manner and the only possible way in my mind is through gaining the right to vote.\"\n\n'There's a stigma behind teenagers voting'\n\nDavid from Newport, is studying maths, business and physics.\n\nThe 17-year-old said:\"It's going to be the first official time we are going to be heard by the Senedd and people who want to listen to us.\n\n\"You can't put a price on that.\"\n\nHe thinks\"there's a stigma behind teenagers\"when it comes to voting. \n\n\"They are considered to be reckless, and people don't think they understand how the government and politics work, but there is a real drive for 16 and 17-year-olds to have a voice on ethical and social issues.\"\n\nHe described himself as the\"anomaly\"among his friends because he likes listening to what politicians have to say. \n\nHowever, he thinks this is because\"there's not anything in politics for young people\".\n\nFor David, parties focusing on universities and bursaries is\"not enough to make people talk about politics\".\n\nHe wants parties to focus more on education, particularly on apprenticeships and clearer curriculums, adding:\"It [university] might not be the future that some young people see themselves going into.\"\n\nFor those that are unsure about voting in the upcoming election, he said researching each party's manifesto will help people\"truly understand what party is for you\". \n\n'It's our future just as much as it is anyone else's'\n\nLisha, 17, from Wrexham, said 16 and 17-year-olds\"deserve to have a say in what happens to us\".\n\n\"It's our future just as much as it is anyone else's,\"she said.\n\nHowever, she said a lot of her friends were not aware they could vote in the upcoming election, or do not fully understand what they would be voting for.\n\n\"If the parties made more of an effort to make it understandable and promote it more, I think it would be better so more people my age would actually be interested in it.\"\n\nShe wants to see parties consider the environment, equality and LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n\"It's clear people my age want to make a difference and voting is an incredible thing to let us be able to do that,\"she added.\n\nBut Lisha stressed that politics needs to be made more accessible if parties want young people to\"be more invested in our future\".\n\n'Voting allows us to shape our future'\n\nJoel, from Newport, is\"excited\"to be able to vote for the first time after turning 16 a couple of weeks ago. \n\nHe thinks it is important because it\"allows us to shape our future\".\n\nHe said he does not\"have the greatest knowledge of politics but more and more I'm looking into these things and what my vote would mean\".\n\nYoung people are increasingly being made aware of politics, with climate change and Brexit being talking points in school, he said. \n\n\"It [politics] does come up, it's something you see in the news and something you're drawn to talking about.\n\n\"I see adverts from parties on different apps like Instagram.\n\n\"It helps in giving a greater understanding of what politics is and what it allows us to do.\"\nTL;DR: About 70,000 teenagers in Wales aged 16 and 17 will have the right to vote for the first time in the Welsh Parliament election in May - but do enough of this group know about it?\n\nArticle: The images by amateur photographer Phyllis Nicklin were found last year when University of Birmingham staff were clearing out a building.\n\nMs Nicklin, a lecturer from Aston, took the photos between 1953 and 1969.\n\nA selection are on display at the city's Reuben Colley gallery and artists have been invited to interpret the photos.\n\nDavid Oram, from the university, published Ms Nicklin's photos on his local history website, Brumpic.\n\nHe said:\"She's captured a time of change in Birmingham where new buildings [were] going up, the [old ones] coming down.

A 2002 bomb attack that killed 11 French naval engineers in Karachi also plays a part.\n\nThe president and his advisors have dismissed any suggestion of wrong-doing on his part as\"grotesque\".\n\nHowever, there have been continuing suggestions that Mr Sarkozy may know more than he lets on.\n\nThe origins of the affair lie in the years 1993 to 1995, when Nicolas Sarkozy was budget minister in the government of conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.\n\n'Sweeteners'\n\nIn 1994, France negotiated a deal to sell three Agosta-class submarines to Pakistan for a sum equivalent to 826m euros (\u00a3684m, $996m).\n\nIn accordance with standard procedure back then (only in 2000 did France sign an OECD convention outlawing commissions), some 50m euros were paid as\"sweeteners\"to various senior Pakistani figures. \n\nSo much is uncontested (and perfectly legal). However, it is also alleged that a second tranche of commissions was also paid to two Lebanese intermediaries.\n\nAccording to Le Contrat (The Contract), a new book by two French investigative journalists, this second tranche - amounting to 33m euros - was never intended to help secure the submarine contract, which was in any case almost concluded.\n\nInstead, the money was to come back to France in the form of so-called\"retro-commissions\"in order to finance Mr Balladur's 1995 presidential campaign.\n\nThough illegal, resorting to\"retro-commissions\"used to be common practice in the seamy underworld of French political funding. \n\nWhen a major arms or oil contract was negotiated with a foreign country, the commissions would be inflated and part of the money returned secretly to France.\n\nIn this case, it is alleged that the money passed through a complex web of off-shore bank accounts, one of them in the name of a company called Heine in Luxembourg.\n\nThis is where President Sarkozy's name has been drawn in. \n\n'All supposition'\n\nInvestigators in France have already said that in 2007 they found an internal document from the French Naval Construction Directorate (DCN), stating that as budget minister, Nicolas Sarkozy gave his approval for the creation of Heine.\n\nAnd this week a report from the Luxembourg police revealed on the news website Mediapart makes the same allegation. \n\nIt says\"agreement to set up Heine\u2026 appeared to come directly from Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Finance (sic) Minister Nicolas Sarkozy.\"\n\nThe picture created by the allegations is this: \n\nIn 1994, Edouard Balladur was planning to run against Jacques Chirac as the main Gaullist candidate in the following year's election, but he was desperately short of funds.  \n\nSo he allegedly intervened in the Pakistani submarine contract to ensure\"retro-commissions\"to finance his campaign, and used his loyal ally Nicolas Sarkozy to help set up the arrangements.\n\nThe French newspaper Liberation recently reported that in April 1995, Mr Balladur's campaign team lodged 10m francs in cash at the campaign's bank account.  \n\nHalf of the money was in 500 franc notes, it said.\n\nIf the claims of secret funding through\"retro-commissions\"were true, then both Mr Balladur and Mr Sarkozy would have broken the law - with imponderable implications for the president's future.\n\nHowever, both men dismiss the allegations as preposterous, defying their accusers to produce hard evidence. \n\nMr Sarkozy's close aide Claude Gueant said the claims that he had approved the creation of Heine could not be true, because the rules did not require the budget minister to have any say in the matter.\n\nHe also pointed out - correctly - the lack of detail in the leaked section of the Luxembourg police document.\n\n\"It has none of the rigour of a proper police report. It is all supposition, imaginary construction,\"he said.\n\n'State lie'\n\nThe story so far is one of alleged corruption, but there is another twist to the tale - and a bloody one.\n\nIn 1995, Jacques Chirac defeated Mr Balladur in the first round of the vote and went on to become president. \n\nAccording to Le Contrat, he immediately cancelled payment of the commissions which he knew (from intelligence sources) had helped to fund his rival's campaign.\n\nSeven years later, an explosion killed 11 employees of the DCN as they travelled to work in Karachi.\n\nFor a long time it was presumed the attack was the work of al-Qaeda. But last year a new judge in charge of the case, Marc Trevidic, focused on another theory.\n\nHe believes that the Karachi attack may have been carried out on orders from unnamed Pakistani intelligence and military chiefs, angry that their share of the Agosta backhanders was never paid.\n\nIt is a monumental - and unproven - allegation.  But the families of many of those who died are increasingly inclined to believe it.\n\nTheir lawyer, Olivier Morice, is the most outspoken of the president's critics.\n\n\"Nicolas Sarkozy was at the heart of the corruption and he has lied to the families. What we have before us is not some imaginary tale, but a state lie. The families are indignant and demand his resignation,\"he said.\nTL;DR: The French press is sniffing cautiously but persistently around a story that some believe has potential to do enormous damage to President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nArticle: But not 42-year-old Joe Kenny.\n\nThe Northern Ireland man has voted in every election since he was 18 - but has never cast his ballot in private.\n\nThat is because he is blind and requires assistance to mark his ballot paper. But he has said it is\"high time\"an online system was introduced for people with visual impairments.\n\nMr Kenny, along with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) Northern Ireland, are campaigning for electoral officials and representatives to look at online changes so voting is fair and accessible to blind and partially-sighted people.\n\nHe told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster that most people vote and walk away\"safe in the knowledge that you and you alone know who you have marked on that paper\".\n\n\"I, and other blind people, don't have that luxury.\"\n\nWhen Mr Kenny goes to vote, he requires the help of staff at the polling station who'll help him mark his ballot paper.\n\n\"Somebody will have to show me the box or call out the list of candidates and which box that refers to. \n\n\"Then I have to get assistance to find the box on the paper and physically make the mark,\"he said.\n\nIt is a process that makes him feel like voting is\"out of my control\".\n\nAccording to Mr Kenny, two voting aids for partially-sighted people - a large-print ballot paper and a tactile voting device, which fits over the ballot - do not eliminate the need for assistance. \n\nLikewise, a postal vote still requires Mr Kenny to mark a ballot paper with someone's guidance\n\n'Do most things online'\n\nInstead, Mr Kenny is calling for an online solution.\n\n\"We're looking at a print mark on print paper in a sight-orientated environment - it's now time we embraced an online system of voting. It must be possible.\n\n\"I know people will say there's danger of data security or hacking or identity theft, but I can bank online, I can do most anything online nowadays.\n\n\"I don't believe that a system doesn't exist that wouldn't be secure enough for people to vote.\"\n\nHe added that the current system could put blind or partially-sighted people off voting altogether.\n\n\"You're giving away your privacy and your independence. Perhaps you feel like you can't do it, or maybe you don't want to do it or maybe it just seems like too much of a job to do from where you are.\"\n\nDr Jackie Witherow, a director from the RNIB NI, said it was\"simply not acceptable that people can leave their polling station unsure whether they've correctly voted for the candidate of their choice or feel obliged to ask someone else for help\". \n\n\"We want the next Parliament to urgently explore alternatives such as secure digital options,\"she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Kenny is urging people - whether partially sighted or not - to join the campaign.\n\n\"I would ask public representatives and the electoral office to talk to us, talk to people with disabilities, talk to people like the RNIB to find out what can be done.\"\nTL;DR: Total privacy when voting is something most people will take for granted when they go to their polling station in the general election on Thursday.\n\nArticle: A statement from the group's guitarist Frank Iero said Pedicone had been\"caught red-handed stealing from the band and confessed to police\".\n\nHe was thrown out of the group with immediate effect following their gig in Auburn, Washington, last Thursday.\n\nThe band have continued with a replacement on their blink-182 tour.\n\nJarrod Alexander has been drafted in to perform with them.\n\nThe statement from Iero posted on My Chemical Romance's website continued:\"We are heartbroken and sick to our stomachs over this entire situation.\n\n\"The band has no intention of pressing charges or taking this matter any further than we have to.

The game files are enormous\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 requires 107 gigabytes of installation space on the Xbox One. \n\nOn the PlayStation 4 it's 99GB with an extra 50GB required for installation, the studio has said.\n\nAccording to the games site Games Radar that makes the game the heftiest PS4 download ever.\n\nSecond on its list was Battlefield 4 Premium Edition, weighing in at 71GB.\n\nThe game is so big because of its expansive world and attention to tiny details (more on that in a moment) - but it could prove an obstacle to fans with slow broadband and limited storage.\n\n2. Those little details...\n\nOne of the reasons why the game is so enormous is that there are a lot of exquisite little details.\n\nThe detail that has inevitably caught everybody's attention is that apparently when the weather is cold, a certain part of the horse's anatomy can be seen to shrink. \n\nLike in Grand Theft Auto, the weather conditions and even interactions between the 200 species of in-game wildlife are auto-generated, and each item held by the main character, Arthur Morgan, is individually rendered so it moves in its own right as he rides on his horse.\n\n3. RIP Horses\n\nSpeaking of horses - in Red Dead Redemption 2, if your horse dies, it stays dead. You won't see it again. People are very sad about this.\n\n4. Long working hours for studio staff\n\nIn a Vulture magazine interview, Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser praised staff for working 100-hour weeks to get Red Dead Redemption 2 finished. \n\nIt had already missed two previous launch dates - Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 - on the grounds that it wasn't ready.\n\nMr Houser has since clarified that he was referring only to himself and three other members of the senior writing team. \n\nHowever so-called\"crunch culture\"is a controversial area of games development, where developers can be asked or feel obliged to work long hours in the run-up to a title release.\n\n\"The problem is that most people in games get into games because they love them, and that lets companies take advantage of these,\"said Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings creator Mike Dailly.\n\n\"They push developers to work these stupid hours, yet they could easily release the game with a little less content, and it would still be a massive game.\"\n\n5. The gameplay takes 60 hours\n\nDan Houser told Vulture magazine that the 60-hour story mode was shortened from 65 hours in the edit by abandoning a love interest. \n\nFor context, experiencing everything Grand Theft Auto V has to offer would take more than 100 hours, Mr Houser told The Guardian in 2013 when it came out.\n\nHowever it's often said most gamers don't ever finish a game - CNN once put the figure at 90%.\nTL;DR: The hotly anticipated game Red Dead Redemption 2 is due for release on Friday.\n\nArticle: By Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent, S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nThe country has swiftly risen up the grim leader board of coronavirus statistics and its death toll - 41,828 - is now the world's second highest.\n\nThe Americas account for around half of the number of cases globally. Brazil, Latin America's biggest country, is now the epicentre of the epicentre. \n\nBut its leader still seems to care very little - or at least that is the impression he is happy to portray. \n\nFrom the outset, President Jair Bolsonaro has played down the virus. Early on in the crisis, he went on TV several times, calling it a little flu and accusing the media of hysteria. \n\nHe has not scheduled a television address for a while, perhaps not wanting to be drowned out by the din of pot-banging protesters on their balconies intent on making their anger over his leadership heard. \n\nBut in the absence of the public broadcasts, the public display of irreverence continues, even as his people bury their dead in mass graves in the Amazon and hospitals in some parts are verging on collapse. \n\nWhen questioned about the death toll in April, Mr Bolsonaro brushed it off saying\"I'm not a grave-digger\". A week or so later, he was asked for a comment when Brazil overtook China's death toll, to which he responded\"So what?\". \n\nCoronavirus in Brazil\n\nEconomy over health\n\nHis message has remained the same throughout - that the state governors have been reckless in introducing quarantine measures and the collateral damage to the economy will be worse than the effects of the virus itself. \n\n\"His whole strategy is very clear,\"says Oliver Stuenkel, Professor of International Relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo. \n\n\"He doesn't want to be seen as the person responsible for what very well may become the worst economic crisis in Brazil's history. [He's] decided to not take responsibility because he sees that as his best chance to stay in office. I can't see him now changing gears.\"\n\nWhile Brazilians are bracing themselves for the coming weeks - more than 1,000 people are dying every day - politicians are opening the country back up. \n\nSurfers have returned to the beaches in Rio and this week in S\u00e3o Paulo, shops and malls reopened - but, and this is the confusing bit - quarantine has been extended in Brazil's biggest city until the end of the month. \n\nSo who is going to the shops that are now reopening? It's a baffling - and alarming - message. \n\n\"Nobody's taking this seriously,\"says Josy Almeida Balbino, who last week buried her sister Kelly and father Antonio after they died from Covid-19. \n\n\"From one day to the next, people just deteriorate,\"Josy adds. Kelly and Antonio were admitted to hospital on the same day, lay in ICU beds next to each other, and died within a day of each other. \n\n\"They're opening up again, in the worst moment of the crisis,\"adds her son Marcos. \n\nPolitics v pandemic\n\nAt a time when Brazil needs to be putting all its efforts into fighting the virus, the president has been doing nothing of the sort. Instead, he's been wrapped up in his own political battles. \n\nThe Supreme Court is investigating allegations of disinformation and intimidation by his supporters. He is also being investigated over allegations that he interfered in federal police investigations to protect his family. \n\nTensions between Mr Bolsonaro and the judiciary are high.\n\nAt times, these past few months, the politics has been bigger than the pandemic. That is not to say the health crisis is less important, but the magnitude of the political scandals is so huge and the implications so important for Brazil. \n\nThere is anger over Mr Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis - but also a growing fear of where Brazil is headed after the pandemic passes. \n\nThe president has undoubtedly lost support in recent months but his core base has been strengthened. Around 30% of people support him. They want the economy running and think the concern over the virus is overblown. Their backing is more fervent than ever. \n\nFor those who oppose Mr Bolsonaro, the spectre of the military is worrying. He openly praises Brazil's two-decade-long military dictatorship. And he backs demonstrations calling for military intervention and an end to Congress and the Supreme Court. \n\nThe role of the military has been strengthened in this pandemic - gone are not just one but two health ministers - both doctors - and in their place, Eduardo Pazuello, an interim minister who has no medical background, he is a general. He has since made several military appointees in the Ministry of Health.\n\nUnder Mr Pazuello, the army has been tasked with upping production of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial promoted by Jair Bolsonaro and President Donald Trump  with no proven benefits in the treatment of Covid-19.\n\nNobody knows where this pandemic is heading in Brazil. With such woeful levels of testing it's so hard to get a true picture of the extent of the virus here but everyone agrees the real picture is far worse than official figures suggest. \n\nNobody knows where Brazil is headed either - and that for many, is a more worrying picture than the pandemic itself.\nTL;DR: Brazil's handling of the pandemic has turned highly political.\n\nArticle: By Hannah RichardsonBBC News education reporter \n\nThe Education Committee heard evidence on requests for delayed school starts for reasons of academic maturity.\n\nMichelle Melson, of the Summer Born Campaign, said some head teachers sent work to pre-schools so pupils could skip Reception and start in Year 1.\n\nMinisters say there is no evidence a later school start is beneficial.\n\nSchools Minister Nick Gibb stressed to MPs there was\"no statutory barrier to children being admitted outside their age-group\", but he added:\"Parents do not have the right to expect this.\"\n\nSome parents of children born between June and August wish to delay their school start because they are worried their young four-year-olds will be expected to do too much too soon.\n\nNumerous research papers suggest summer born children do less well academically, as they are labelled less able than their older peers and are constantly trying to catch up.\n\nSome even ask to defer a year, with the aim that they start school in Reception in an age-group closer to their own chronological age.\n\nBut at a one-off hearing before the committee on starting school, Ms Melson told MPs:\"Parents are being forced to enrol their child early, prior to compulsory school age, in order to gain a place in their preferred school.\"\n\nThis often means children whose parents delay school entry because they are very young for their year will end up missing Reception class and joining school in Year 1, as they are rarely allowed to defer entry in reality.\n\n'Chronological batches'\n\nShe said:\"It's not just Reception class that they can be made to miss. Parents are also currently being threatened that they will have to miss Year 7 or another year in school.\n\nThis is because having argued their case for starting primary after their age-group, they may not win the same argument at secondary school and may have to go back up to their chronological age-group - hence missing Year 7.\n\nThe notion of missing a year was against the academic evidence, which suggested the more schooling children received, the better they performed academically, she added.\n\nMs Melson also said that where parents were being allowed to defer school entry, they were being told that the pre-school they attended would effectively be their Reception year.\n\n\"Some head teachers are telling parents their children will then start in Year 1, but that they will send work to the pre-school,\"she said.\n\nMs Melson pointed out that there was a great deal of difference between the way children were taught in Reception, which is more play-based, and Year 1, which is more formal.\n\nBut Tammy Campbell, researcher and analyst, at London's Institute of Education, told MPs that children in Reception were increasingly being taught phonics in a formal way.\n\n'Widen the gap'\n\nShe said this was despite the fact that it was developmentally normal to not be able to say some of the phonic sounds required for this form of learning to read.\n\n\"There's a disconnect between what is required in Reception class and what is developmentally normal,\"she said.\n\nMr Gibb defended the practice of phonics teaching in Reception, saying children of this age were generally ready to start learning to read.\n\nHe said:\"There is no evidence that having a later school start age will have any affect on addressing the relative age effects.\n\n\"I worry also if we were to have an increase in the school start age that it would widen the attainment gap between poorer and wealthier peers.\"\n\nOfficial Department for Education guidance says a child reaches compulsory school age when he or she is five years old.\n\nThe term\"summer born\"is used to refer to children born from 1 April to 31 August. \n\nThese children are not required to start school until a full school year after the point at which they could first have been admitted.\nTL;DR: Parents of summer-born children are being told they could miss out on a year of secondary school if they delay their start at primary, MPs have heard.\n\nArticle: Port Talbot will suffer more than half of the 1,050 UK job cuts announced by Tata Steel on Monday.  \n\nMr Jones said it was a\"devastating blow to the community and the wider economy\", announcing a task force. \n\nWelsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the UK government would work with Tata to\"ensure they remain a significant presence in south Wales\".\n\n\"Workers and their families at the plant face a deeply worrying time, and our priority is to help those likely to be affected,\"Mr Crabb said.\n\n\"The UK government will keep doing what it can to support a steel industry suffering intense pressures from cheap steel imports and a global slump in prices.\"\n\nBut he told BBC Wales the idea of government taking a stake in Tata Steel was\"intellectually lazy\".\n\n\"They're the ones with the expertise to know how to create value and create profit in a very challenging steel industry,\"he said.\n\nBusiness Minister Anna Soubry later told MPs in the House of Commons steel was a\"vital industry\".\n\nShe said the UK government was doing all it could to help Tata Steel find a\"sustainable future\", within the limitations of EU rules on state aid.\n\n'Decisive action'\n\nBut the first minister blamed the UK government for failing to tackle the industry's high energy costs and cheap Chinese exports.\n\n\"I don't think the UK government took seriously the issue of below-cost supply on the market and lobbied effectively in order to provide protection there,\"Mr Jones said.\n\n\"I don't think it's taken action quickly enough over energy prices.\"\n\nA Welsh government taskforce, chaired by Economy Minister Edwina Hart, will meet on Wednesday to discuss a plan to help workers, he added.\n\nAberavon Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said the Port Talbot plant was the\"beating heart of our economy, and our community\".\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those who will be most directly affected by this terrible news, and we must now do all we can to rally around them and their families,\"he said.\n\nPlaid Cymru economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth called on the Welsh government to\"look with urgency at all options\"to support the steel industry, including taking a temporary stake in Tata Steel to safeguard the remaining jobs.\n\n\"There is a bright future for steel in Wales, but urgent help is needed to get us through these difficult times,\"he said.\n\nFor the Welsh Liberal Democrats, South Wales West AM Peter Black said:\"These are well-paid jobs and will prove difficult to replace.\"\n\n\"If the two governments do not act quickly and decisively together to start to put things right then I fear that there may well be more job losses,\"he added. \n\nUKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill claimed ministers were\"impotent\"due to membership of the European Union.\n\n\"They can't offer state aid, they are limited in reducing energy costs and they can't act to prevent the dumping of cheap Chinese steel, all because of the EU,\"he said before the announcement.\nTL;DR: First Minister Carwyn Jones has said steel job cuts could have been avoided if UK ministers had acted sooner.\n\nArticle: Masked men forced the early closure of the main polling centre in an ethnically mixed Kosovan town during the municipal elections.\n\nThey burst into the building in north Mitrovica, setting off tear gas canisters and smashing ballot boxes.\n\nEthnic Serbs were encouraged to vote for the first time but as polls closed on Sunday evening there were concerns of a low turnout.\n\nCredibility issue\n\nThe Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had been providing technical assistance in the election, but following the attack in north Mitrovica it withdrew its staff from all three polling stations in the area, bringing polling there to an end. \n\nA candidate for mayor of Mitrovica, Krstimir Pantic, described what happened when the masked men stormed the polling station:\"They started smashing ballot boxes, throwing ballot papers around, insulting members of the election commission, and one older woman was seriously injured because one of the attackers hit her with a chair. \n\n\"We heard that another woman had also been injured, her leg was broken, and this shows the bestiality and arrogance of the attackers.\"\n\nThe governments of both Serbia and Kosovo had promoted a strong turnout in the elections, but correspondents say it was extremely quiet at polling stations.\n\nSome Kosovar Serbs were concerned that if they voted it would legitimise the independent state of Kosovo. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008.\n\nThe move had the support of Kosovo's majority Albanian population, but not the small Serbian minority.\n\nFor the first time, the government in Belgrade put pressure on Kosovo's Serb population to take part in the municipal elections. \n\nThe change was down to a new agreement between Serbia and Kosovo to normalise relations, as Serbia seeks membership of the European Union.\n\nPolling stations opened at 06:00 GMT and closed at 18:00 GMT.\n\nThe BBC's Guy De Launey, in Mitrovica, says the government in Belgrade has considerable influence over ethnic Serbs in north Kosovo, many of whom work in Serbian public sector jobs.\n\nBut our correspondent, who was at a polling station in north Mitrovica, says the only people going in and out appeared to be ethnic Albanians.  \n\nIf there is no significant turnout among Serbs, our correspondent says, the election will have little credibility - and that would be a blow to the Serbian government, which has staked a lot on the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. \n\nCalls for independence from ethnic Albanians in Kosovo after the break-up of the former Yugoslavia led Serbia to stage a violent crackdown in the territory, which was bought to an end by a Nato military intervention in 1999.  \n\nUntil it declared independence in 2008, Kosovo was administered by the United Nations.\nTL;DR: Outbreaks of violence have marred key elections in Kosovo.\n\nArticle: Permission was granted in February last year for developer City and County to turn Dorchester Prison into 185 homes.\n\nIt is believed Martha Brown, the last woman to be hanged in Dorset, is among former inmates buried at the site.\n\nOscar-winning screenwriter Julian Fellowes previously led calls for all bodies at the site to be exhumed.\n\nCity and Country has still not confirmed how many burial plots it plans to excavate but said those that are exhumed would be moved to Poundbury Cemetery, in agreement with Dorchester Town Council and the Diocese of Salisbury.\n\nThe Bishop of Salisbury will now produce an official order\"to remove the legal effects of the consecration so that the burials can be sensitively exhumed and presented for reburial\", the developer said.\n\nA spokesman for the diocese said any recovered bodies would be given\"a proper Christian reinternment\". \n\nThe developer previously agreed any remains at risk of being disturbed should be exhumed.\n\nIt is not known exactly how many bodies lie within or outside of the prison's consecrated burial ground at sites identified in 2015.\n\nHowever, both the council and Cotswold Archaeology, which is carrying out the archaeological works, said there were likely to be\"a lot less\"than initially thought.\n\nA number of public executions took place at the site, including that of Martha Brown - who was hanged in 1856 for the murder of her abusive husband.\n\nHer execution was witnessed by the author Thomas Hardy and was said to have inspired his novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles.\n\nLord Fellowes, president of the Thomas Hardy Society and creator of Downton Abbey, previously said it would be\"very disrespectful\"not to exhume all bodies at the site.\nTL;DR:",

A gospel choir performed the soul classic Stand By Me.\n\nAnd yet there was still a horse-drawn carriage, a diamond tiara and veil, Schubert and the Philharmonic.\n\nIt was, by general agreement, a beautiful wedding which honoured traditions in the families and backgrounds of both bride and groom. \n\nOf course a wedding on that scale isn't typical, but it did get people talking. While couples are increasingly choosing imaginative ways to celebrate, some argue the industry is still behaving as if everyone tying the knot is white. \n\n'Ignored'\n\nWhen Assumpta Vitcu got engaged, a friend bought her a pile of wedding magazines. But the sight of them blunted her excitement.\n\n\"It was very disheartening not to see myself reflected in the pages,\"says Nigerian-British Assumpta. \n\nShe handed them to her fianc\u00e9 Horia, who is Romanian. But when he looked the only black face he could find was the tiny figure of a marriage officiant in a Caribbean wedding.\n\nIt got worse. When she went to a wedding show, where hundreds of firms market their wares and services, she felt almost invisible.\n\nShe stood at one stand while the jeweller attended a previous customer.\n\n\"He didn't acknowledge me once,\"she says.\"Then two Caucasian women walked over and he immediately said'please give me a moment and I'll be right with you.'\"\n\nShe walked away infuriated. Perhaps, she says, he assumed that she had limited financial means. \n\nSpending power\n\nShe had a similar experience at a bridal boutique in London's financial district of Canary Wharf, where she says the shop assistants automatically showed her the cheapest, entry-level options.\n\nYet in the end, Assumpta had a bespoke designer dress with a huge train as well as two more dresses to wear at the Nigerian celebration she held alongside her\"traditional\"wedding. Horia dressed in bespoke suit and handmade shoes, as well as in Nigerian traditional dress.\n\nThere are strong ethical reasons why the bridal industry should reflect a greater diversity in the pages of magazines, and treat customers with equal respect. But there are sound financial reasons too.\n\nThe typical UK wedding now costs around \u00a330,000 and it's a vast industry of photographers, flowers, honeymoons, music, make-up, stationery, hair, clothes, catering and cake decorating. If firms are failing to appeal to a segment of their customers, they're missing out on business.\n\n'Bizarre silence'\n\nZoe Burke, an editor at the online wedding site Confetti.co.uk, says it is only gradually dawning on the industry that they could be doing better. \n\n\"There's been a long overdue awakening,\"she says.\"For a long time there's been a growing consciousness that the industry as a whole hasn't been reflective of the society that we live in.\"\n\nConfetti is trying to do its bit. Two out of three editions of its magazine have featured Asian and mixed-race cover models.\n\n\"I think the wedding of Harry and Meghan made the industry pay more attention to the fact that there is a huge variety of couples out there and that they need to feel represented.\"\n\nNova Reid says she also noticed the\"bizarre silence\"around black brides when she began planning her wedding seven years ago.\n\nIt didn't stop at magazines, it was show brochures, business portfolios and catwalk shows. At wedding shows, goody-bags are handed out containing tanning products designed for white brides. Make-up demonstrations didn't cater for black skin.\n\nAvoiding a car crash\n\n\"It was as if these shows were not expecting black women to be coming through the door, not expecting us to be getting married,\"says Nova.\n\nIn the end Nova launched her own bridal brand, Nu Bride, which earlier this year hosted the UK's first wedding show specifically celebrating diversity. \n\nThe show aimed to cater for couples that wanted to fuse different traditions, races, religions and cultures. There were workshops on menus, in case guests were encountering food that was new to them, discussion of what symbols and colours might mean to different people, and how to honour different cultures\"without looking like a car crash\".\n\nNova says the industry would do well to pay closer attention to this market since African, Caribbean and Asian families tend to celebrate for several days, with more guests and more lavish events, spending around twice the general average.\n\nShe says mixed couples in particular want to reflect their backgrounds in their weddings, because often they've faced extra hurdles; a wedding that celebrates both cultures can help to legitimise the union.\n\n\"For some people getting married is about overcoming discrimination, so it is about being seen. And there is something about not being catered to that can make you feel you are valued less as a human being.\"\n\nFusion\n\nTwo years ago Sophia married Ayoola Olatunde, a British Nigerian, and since her Pakistani family didn't approve, many, including her parents and brother, chose not to attend. But she was still determined to reflect all the aspects of their joint heritage, including their Britishness.\n\nWhile the industry catering to traditional South Asian weddings is huge and well-established, she found firms weren't prepared to provide things that veered from very traditional styles. She says although most of her friends seem to be in inter-racial partnerships, Asian wedding firms appear to be even more resistant to change than the mainstream wedding industry.\n\nSophia couldn't find caterers that would fuse Asian and African food traditions.\"They said there would have to be two caterers, two kitchens.\"\n\nSo in the end they ate chicken in pastry with a dash of turmeric.\"It was delicious,\"she says.\"But very British.\"\n\nThey managed to create a sense of mingled cultures with her in Punjabi dress and the groom in a green tailored jacket. Her bridesmaids wore saris. His family was in Nigerian dress.\n\nSince she is Muslim and her husband a Christian they asked a humanist celebrant to conduct a non-denominational service and the DJ provided a particularly successful blend of pop, Punjabi music and Afrobeat.\n\nBut for the most part, she says, it felt like she was planning two parallel celebrations.\n\n\"I wanted a balance of cultures, but in the end I had to find separate ways. I would love for someone to offer the fusion.\"\nTL;DR: A year ago Meghan and Harry charmed the nation with their own, not entirely traditional, special day.\n\nArticle: By Fran MolloySydney\n\nCrocodiles, sharks and dingoes are among Australia's most feared wild animals, subject to major culls following attacks on humans. Kangaroos, which feature on the national coat of arms, have been killed to protect grazing land and even racetracks.\n\nBut an embryonic movement to live more harmoniously with native and some non-native animals is slowly taking hold in scientific and government circles, and in some parts of the country, scientists, farmers and local authorities are working together to find kinder and more effective ways to live with wildlife.\n\nCulling controversies\n\nAt the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) in New South Wales, Dan Ramp heads the Centre for Compassionate Conservation. He says the theory of compassionate conservation has moral, scientific and economic credibility. \n\n\"Years of research shows us that killing animals often makes no difference to the conservation targets we have set ourselves, so we need to think about other ways of engaging.\"\n\nA prime example of the failure of programmes that try to control animals by culling can be found in Western Australia.\n\nLast summer, following a spate of fatal attacks by great white sharks, the state government instituted a 13-week trial where baited drum lines were set off Perth beaches.\n\nDuring the trial, which cost the government A$1.3m (\u00a3710,000; $1.14m), 68 sharks were caught and shot, but none of them were great whites. \n\nIn New South Wales, Mr Ramp is working with Bathurst Regional Council, after its 2009 cull of kangaroos near the Mount Panorama motorcar racing circuit provoked an international outcry.\n\nBathurst Regional Councillor Jess Jennings says that about 90% of the 6km track has now been fenced and the council has retained UTS scientists to monitor kangaroo behaviour so they can be better managed when races are held. \n\n\"Culling all the local kangaroos would hurt tourism - and still couldn't guarantee that a single lost kangaroo travelling through the area wouldn't jump the fence onto the track,\"says Mr Jennings. \n\nIn Victoria, tourism and local governments have protected a population of penguins by introducing a pair of Maremma guardian dogs, a breed whose natural territorial behaviour deters local foxes that had previously devastated the colony. \n\nSince the dogs arrived in 2006, penguin numbers have climbed from 10 to nearly 200 - and it has been done without wiping out foxes. \n\n\"It's a great project that the whole community is very proud of,\"says Peter Abbott, Warrnambool City council tourism manager, although he admits that baiting and shooting foxes is still carried out beyond the penguin colony. \n\nBathurst sheep farmer Ian Whalan lost many lambs to foxes before he invented a sequential light system that deters the animals at night. \n\nHis Foxlights are now used to deter nocturnal predators worldwide, including protecting yaks from snow leopards in Nepal and deterring elephants from raiding crops in Zambia. \n\nBut despite isolated moves towards compassionate conservation, most wildlife management in Australia takes a terminal view. \n\n\"By far the option of choice for animal control in Australia is killing,\"says Greg Baxter, president of the Australasian Wildlife Management Society, which represents wildlife researchers and practitioners in the Australian region.\n\nHe agrees lethal methods may be less effective in the long term but says landowners want fast, visible results. \n\n\"They want to see fox pelts and dingo pelts hanging on a string of barbed wire to show something has happened,\"he says.\n\nAdapting to ecosystems\n\nBrad Purcell, a Churchill Fellow and now a lecturer in environmental management at the University of Western Sydney, spent years tracking dingoes in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, examining the role the wild dogs play in the local ecosystem.\n\nHe found that dingoes hunt selectively, controlling not just the population but also the behaviour of their prey, and affecting the whole ecosystem.\n\n\"Kangaroos become more cautious and more wary, and assign sentinel animals so they are constantly on the lookout and don't forage simultaneously.\"\n\n\"When a dingo comes, the mob will scatter, hiding in a shrubby area and then later feeding on a different hillside,\"he says. \n\nThis wider distribution of species and their feeding habits has a huge impact on the landscape, he adds, and helps vegetation regenerate.  \n\nWild dogs are currently a declared pest, with rangers and landowners obliged to eradicate them, often using costly poisoned baits. Mr Purcell says the strategy does not work because when one pack is cleared another usually moves into the area.\n\nHe says understanding the behaviour of dingoes is key to peaceful co-existence, and techniques like deterrent lights, marking territory with other dog scents and staggering livestock rotation to fit with dingo breeding seasons will deliver wider benefits. \n\n\"Ultimately, we need to adapt to the ecosystem rather than make the ecosystem adapt to us.\"\nTL;DR: Wild animals in Australia that pose a threat to humans or livestock have been systematically shot, trapped and poisoned for more than two centuries.\n\nArticle: Five places have already bid to hold the title in 2023 - Dundee, Nottingham, Leeds, Milton Keynes and Belfast/Derry. \n\nBut the commission has said the UK will no longer be eligible to have a host city after it leaves the EU in 2019.\n\nThe Creative Industries Federation said it was\"gutted\", while arts minister John Glen called it a\"crazy decision\".\n\nPlans for the UK to host a Capital of Culture in 2023 were announced in 2014 - before the EU referendum.\n\nIn December 2016, the UK government said the competition would\"run as normal\", but did warn bidders that it\"may be subject to\"the Brexit negotiations.\n\nLiverpool was the last British city to be a European Capital of Culture, in 2008, following Glasgow in 1990.\n\nThe title of European Capital of Culture rotates around eligible countries. \n\nCities from non-EU countries have held the title before - but if a country isn't in the EU, it must be a candidate to join or must be in the European Free Trade Association or European Economic Area.\n\nGovernment'deeply disappointed'\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was in\"urgent discussions\"with the commission about the decision.\n\n\"We disagree with the European Commission's stance and are deeply disappointed that it has waited until after UK cities have submitted their final bids before communicating this new position to us,\"a statement said.\n\n\"The prime minister has been clear that while we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe and this has been welcomed by EU leaders.\"\n\nThe statement said the government wants the UK to continue\"working with our friends in Europe\", including in cultural programmes, and will work with the bidders to\"help them realise their cultural ambitions\".\n\n#Brexitfallout\n\nThe Creative Industries Federation, which represents the arts sector, said:\"We are gutted to learn that the UK will not be allowed to host the European Capital of Culture as planned in 2023 after Brexit.\n\n\"This is despite the fact that cities in Europe that are outside the European Union have participated in the scheme historically.\"\n\nIt added that people were\"working feverishly behind the scenes to reverse this decision\".\n\nThe federation's deputy chief executive Rosie Millard, who was to be among the contest's judges, wrote on Twitter:\"Very sad for the 5 bidding cities.

Nine local education authorities (LEA) had higher rates, with the worst being Cardiff at 2.7%.\n\nAlthough overall absence rates have been slowly decreasing each year since 2005/06, ministers say more needs to be done.\n\nA Welsh government spokesman said although the regulations were coming into force in September, ministers did not expect the first wave of fines to be rolled out for a number of months.\n\n'Lazy'\n\n\"Local authorities will have to draw up their own code of conduct as well as put them out to consultation first,\"he added.\n\n\"This could take some time and will vary between each local authority.\"\n\nBut the National Union of Teachers (NUT) in Wales said it was disappointed the Welsh government had chosen to introduce fines for persistent truancy, adding that it could undermine some of the good work that was already happening. \n\nNUT Cymru policy officer Owen Hatchway said:\"We know that persistent truancy is a problem for schools. \n\n\"However, this is an issue where substantial progress is being made. The latest figures show record levels of attendance in the primary sector and significant improvements in attendance in secondary schools. \n\n\"Whilst no one should rest on their laurels, the union is concerned that the introduction of truancy fines could have a counterproductive impact and undermine the good work being undertaken.\"\n\nConservative education spokesperson Angela Burns AM said she feared fines would stack up while behaviour remained largely unchanged.\n\n\"This is a lazy Labour government piling all its eggs into a basket of punishment at the expense of support and liaison,\"she said.\n\n\"There is a real danger that these fines will hit the most vulnerable hardest and ignore the real reasons behind truancy.\"\n\n'Poorer backgrounds'\n\nWelsh Liberal Democrat education spokesman Aled Roberts described the Welsh government's decision as counter-productive.\n\n\"Evidence shows that children from poorer backgrounds are more likely to play truant and achieve poorer educational outcomes. \n\n\"I am concerned that fining parents of truant pupils will cause them even more economic hardship and will do nothing to address the problems of their child missing vital school hours.\"\n\nSimon Thomas for Plaid Cymru said he backed policies to support pupils and families to tackle truancy, rather than introduce fines.\n\n\"Introducing fixed penalty notices are a retrograde step,\"he added. \n\n\"They have not worked when they were introduced in England. The education minister needs to state where any money raised will go.\"\nTL;DR: Parents of children who are regular school truants are to be fined up to \u00a3120, says the Welsh government.\n\nArticle: By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter\n\nThe Windrush scandal dominated, leading to some of the most explosive exchanges yet between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn a pre-emptive strike, the prime minister went straight into an apology for the\"confusion and anxiety\"caused to the children of first generation Commonwealth immigrants threatened with deportation because they haven't got the right paperwork.\n\nResponding to a planted question from a Tory MP, she said:\"These people are British. They are part of us.\"She repeated her pledge that no one with the right to be in the UK would be deported.\n\nJeremy Corbyn referred back to a case he had raised a month ago at Prime Minister's Questions - that of Albert Thompson, a man who had been denied NHS cancer treatment he was entitled to because he did not have the right documentation. He accused Mrs May of\"brushing it off\".\n\nThe Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, said Mrs May, and his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. She suggested Mr Thompson was not part of the Windrush generation.\n\nThen it was on to the landing cards - documents that could have shown when Commonwealth citizens arrived in the UK - that were destroyed by the UK Border Agency during an office move in 2010.\n\nMr Corbyn tried to pin the decision on Mrs May who was home secretary in 2010 when it was thought to have been taken. Not so, said Mrs May,\"the decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009 under a Labour government\". \n\nThis was news to Mr Corbyn and everybody else (Labour's Jacqui Smith and then Alan Johnson were the home secretaries during the year in question and they have both said they can't remember anything about it).\n\nThe Labour leader switched to an attack on the\"hostile environment\"for illegal immigrants that was created by Home Secretary May, in 2014, which he said had led to the current Windrush debacle. \n\nHe then swung back round on to the landing cards, suggesting again Mrs May had been responsible and saying Parliament needed\"absolute clarity\"on when the decision was taken. It was in 2009, Mrs May told him.\n\nThe prime minister - perhaps sensing that she had got one over on Mr Corbyn - then ventured into a defence of her crackdown on illegal immigration, saying it was\"absolutely right\"that only people entitled to use public services used them.\n\n\"This isn't about illegal immigration,\"said Mr Corbyn, but about Commonwealth citizens\"who have a right to be here\". He asked how many people from the Windrush generation have been deported.\n\nMr Corbyn said he had just received information that Albert Thompson had still not been told when he will get the treatment he needs.\n\nShouting across the despatch box as the noise levels from MPs rose, Mr Corbyn said the responsibility for the Windrush debacle\"lies firmly at the prime minister's door\"because of her\"pandering to bogus immigration targets\"when she was home secretary, which he said had led to a\"hostile environment\"and British citizens\"thrown into detention centres like criminals\".\n\nHe said the Windrush generation came to the UK after the war to help rebuild the country, and claimed Mrs May's government was both\"heartless and hopeless\"and\"callous and incompetent\".\n\nTheresa May agreed that the Windrush generation\"did help to build our country, they are British\"which was why the government was working to ensure they could prove their status.\n\nShe then took an angry swipe at Mr Corbyn over allegations of anti-Semitism aired by some of his own MPs in an emotional Commons debate on Tuesday.\n\n\"He talks about being callous, I will not take that from a man who allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party.\"\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's Leader at Westminster Ian Blackford zeroed in on Esther McVey, who sparked controversy on Monday by describing the so-called\"rape clause\"in Universal Credit as an opportunity for victims to get help. Did the PM agree with the work pension secretary?\n\nEllie Reeves, Labour MP for  Lewisham West and Penge, asked if the rise in violent crime in London was down to police cuts.\n\nThe Verdicts\n\nHere's what the BBC's Andrew Neil and Laura Kuenssberg made of it:\n\nAnd here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on it:\n\nThat was just about as bitter a PMQs exchange as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have had.\n\nThe PM was accused of pandering to fears about immigration and creating a Home Office that was\"heartless and hopeless\". But the PM was prepared.\n\nA critical detail in the Windrush saga is the destruction of critical immigration records - and she said that decision was taken under a Labour government.\n\nIt was a point of detail which tripped the Labour leader up - and his voice increasingly had that edge of anger that creeps in in pressure situations.\n\nThe PM had, courtesy of a former special advisor, Neil O'Brien, already taken the opportunity to lay out her position before Mr Corbyn rose - and she didn't give an inch, in the face of intense attack in an unruly House.\n\nAnd her lashback about Labour's internal battle over anti-Semitism delighted her side.\n\nCornered on unfavourable ground, the PM won this exchange - although Jeremy Corbyn's succession of pointed phrases are doubtless already running on Facebook, and will play well with his target voters.\n\nThe Speaker intervened several times to quieten the House and rebuke hecklers - at one point complaining of\"stupid\"behaviour. Although he didn't name the miscreants. The atmosphere was poisonous - and with the political temperature rising, it will probably continue to curdle.\n\nNo-one expects sugary matiness at PMQs, but this kind of mutual contempt is corrosive.\n\nPredictably (although I failed to predict it) there were plenty of questions pegged to the Commonwealth summit, taking place a short distance away.\n\nNigel Evans raised the issue of gay rights in Commonwealth countries, Stella Creasey complained about an extradition case.\n\nAnd in 40 minutes, no-one mentioned Brexit.\n\nWhat pundits are saying on Twitter\n\nAnd finally, for podcast fans\nTL;DR: Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened.\n\nArticle: New South Wales police said 700 sought medical help for drug-related issues at Sydney's Defqon. 1 and three people are in a critical condition.\n\nState premier Gladys Berejiklian called the annual event unsafe and said it should not take place again. \n\nOrganisers Q-Dance Australia said they are cooperating with the authorities.\n\nThe two dead have not been named but they were both in their 20s and died in hospital after collapsing, according to police. \n\n\"I'm absolutely aghast at what has occurred...\"Ms Berejiklian said in a statement.\"This is an unsafe event and I'll be doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nPolice said 10 people have been charged with drug offences, including two teenagers who allegedly carried 120 tablets to the event. \n\nThe Defqon 1 festival, held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre, plays mostly hardcore techno, house and trance music.\n\nThere have been two other deaths at the festival in recent years. The event has been running since 2009.\n\n\"We do everything we possibly can to make these events safe. What we can't do is be in people's heads, be in people's decision-making processes when they decide to take illicit drugs,\"said Assistant Police Commissioner Allan Sicard.\nTL;DR: Australian state authorities have vowed to shut down a dance music festival after two people died from a suspected drugs overdose.\n\nArticle: By Robert PlummerBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nM&S has bought a 50% share of Ocado's retail business, which gives the grocer an internet-based delivery service for the first time.\n\nBut the\"surge in demand\"meant Ocado was unable to fulfil what it called a\"very small number\"of orders.\n\nThe firm apologised to those affected.\n\n\"The vast majority of customers are unaffected and will be delivered as normal. We would like to thank our customers for giving M&S such a big welcome and sincere apologies to any customers having to wait a bit longer,\"it said in a statement.\n\nM&S has now begun doing something many of its competitors have been doing for years - it is making its full food range available to order online. \n\nA number of customers vented their disappointment at having their orders cancelled at the last minute, despite booking them well in advance\n\nOne customer tweeted:\"Big day but you've cancelled my order that has been booked for 4 weeks! Long time customer who now can't get a delivery until Sunday... shocking service!\"\n\nAnother said she was taking her business elsewhere in future.\n\n\"My order due 2pm tomorrow has been cancelled. I booked the slot over 10 days ago. I have been an Ocado customer for 10 years. Day 1 of M&S and I want to know how I can cancel my membership,\"she said.\n\nThe deal with Ocado comes at a crucial time for M&S, which is cutting 7,000 jobs.\n\nBut analysts are divided on the wisdom of the deal.\n\nOne expert, Kate Hardcastle, told the BBC that M&S had\"taken a long time\"to enter the online grocery market and that expectations were high.\n\nBut another analyst, Richard Hyman, said the move could erode the retailer's profits and was\"a big mistake\".\n\nUntil now, the only M&S food available online has been party food and celebration dinners to order or, in certain locations, a limited range of about 130 M&S food and household items through Deliveroo.\n\nBut if you live in Scotland, you're out of luck. Ocado does not currently operate north of the border and has no plans to do so at present.\n\nWhat does the deal mean for shoppers?\n\nFor existing customers of Ocado, it means big changes.\n\nIn the past, consumers who wanted to buy into Waitrose's upmarket image without busting their budget had the option of choosing from the supermarket's Essential Waitrose range.\n\nBut now they will need to take their pick from M&S's Remarksable Value range instead.\n\nShoppers can now choose from 6,000 M&S food items, alongside Ocado own-label goods and big-name branded items.\n\nM&S has vowed that all its replacement products will be the same price as, or cheaper than, the equivalent Waitrose items.\n\nM&S and Ocado say that their joint offer now amounts to more than 50,000 products, which they say is\"double that of the next largest grocery retailer\".\n\nBut if Ocado customers don't like the new set-up, they have the option of switching to Waitrose's own delivery service, Waitrose.com.\n\nHow important is it for M&S?\n\nThe tie-up with Ocado comes at a critical time for M&S.\n\nThe retailer employs almost 78,000 people, most of them in the UK.\n\nThe bulk of the latest job cuts are expected to come among shop floor workers, with about 12% of customer assistant roles going.\n\nThe deal with Ocado was originally announced early last year, well before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 has exacerbated existing problems for M&S, which has struggled to restore the fortunes of its hard-hit clothing and home goods divisions since shops reopened after lockdown.\n\nAt the height of lockdown, M&S boss Steve Rowe said customers might\"never shop the same way again\"after the coronavirus crisis.\n\nAs a result, the company is shifting resources and recruiting towards areas that are expanding - online and food.\n\nWhat does it mean for Ocado?\n\nOcado Retail chief executive Melanie Smith hailed the deal as a\"winning combination of the country's fastest-growing grocer and the nation's most beloved food brand\".\n\nBut it could still be a tricky moment for the online grocer if it turns out that shoppers valued Waitrose's goods more than they did Ocado's customer service and user-friendly website.\n\nAnd Ocado now has to face stronger competition, with its former partner eager to win market share for its own website.\n\nOcado has been offering Waitrose products since it began its commercial delivery service in 2002.\n\nAt that time, Waitrose already had its own internet-based deliveries, but on a much smaller basis. Now it says it can reach 90% of UK postcodes.\n\n\"The supply relationship has worked well for almost 20 years, but now both parties are ready to go their own way,\"says Waitrose.\n\nWhat do the experts think?\n\nConsumer and retail expert Kate Hardcastle told the BBC she had placed an order for 1 September to test the new Ocado and had so far had two items cancelled.\n\n\"For each one, they sent me a \u00a35 voucher,\"she said, adding that this was an indication of how much pressure M&S and Ocado were under to get their partnership right.\n\n\"Everyone's expectations are pretty high and the world is watching,\"she added.\n\nShe acknowledged that M&S could have been in the online grocery market sooner, but compared the delay with previous foot-dragging by the retailer over issues such as accepting credit cards.\n\n\"M&S do things very much their way,\"she said.\"They've taken a long time to do it, but if there's a time to do it, it's now.\"\n\nHowever, another retail analyst, Richard Hyman, thinks the whole deal is misconceived and M&S should stay on the High Street.\n\n\"It's very difficult to make money from selling food online,\"he told the BBC.\"I'm not sure that anyone does.\"\n\nMr Hyman said M&S had\"a terrific food business as it stands\", but risked eroding its profit margins as it tried to turn itself into a destination for the family shop.\n\n\"Old business thinking says,'We must get bigger,'\"he says.\"But being big isn't as beautiful as it used to be.\"\n\nHe said M&S was\"trying to please too many people\"and would\"dilute its core offering\"as a result.\n\n\"It's almost as if M&S aspires to be like other food retailers, which strikes me as a big mistake.\"\nTL;DR: Angry Ocado customers have been complaining to the online grocer after their orders were cancelled on the first day of the firm's tie-up with Marks and Spencer.\n\nArticle: Police were called to St Mark's West Essex Catholic School in Harlow on Thursday following reports that eight girls had taken a Class B drug.\n\nThe teenager was arrested on suspicion of having drugs with intent to supply and released under investigation.\n\nAll affected pupils had been discharged from hospital, the school confirmed.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"On Thursday 28 February, a pupil brought a substance into school. Subsequently, a small number of pupils felt unwell and notified school staff.\n\n\"They were taken to hospital as a precaution. All were discharged the same day without need for further medical attention.\n\n\"This unprecedented incident was dealt with quickly and efficiently, in accordance with health and safety procedures. The safety of pupils was paramount at all times.\"\n\nThe school confirmed that the parents of the pupils involved had been\"fully supportive\"of the way the matter was handled.\n\nIt also said a full investigation into the incident will now take place.\nTL;DR: A 13-year-old schoolgirl has been arrested on suspicion of dealing drugs to fellow pupils after a number of them needed hospital treatment.\n\nArticle: The body of India Chipchase, 20, was found at a house in Northampton on 31 January.\n\nBookkeeper Edward Tenniswood, 51, of Stanley Road, Northampton, appeared before Northampton Crown Court and pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n\nHe was remanded into custody ahead of a two week trial which is due to start on 18 July.\nTL;DR: A man has denied the rape and murder of a bar worker who went missing after a night out.\n\nArticle: By Dr Faye Kirkland and Noel TitheradgeBBC News\n\nOne of them, Brook House immigration removal centre (IRC) near Gatwick Airport, has been placed on\"lockdown\", according to detainees.\n\nA High Court case later will decide if detainees should be temporarily released while the coronavirus crisis is ongoing.\n\nThe Home Office says it is following guidance from Public Health England.\n\nIt says Brook House IRC, in West Sussex, is taking the necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of both staff and detainees.\n\nDetainees told the BBC they have been sent a note informing them that emergency measures would be introduced requiring them to remain in their rooms with controlled access to showers and fresh air.\n\nIn normal circumstances, most detainees in IRCs are released back into the community after they are found to have a right to remain in the UK or while they are awaiting the outcome of their case.\n\nDetainees and charities say three of the UK's seven immigration removal centres currently have people quarantined with symptoms of coronavirus.\n\nFive detainees in immigration centres have spoken to the BBC. Detainees say they have not been provided with free soap in those three centres, making it impossible to follow guidelines on washing hands.\n\nA detainee who has a role of cleaning inside one of the centres -  Harmondsworth, in west London - said he was aware of a cell not being cleaned after a man with symptoms was moved elsewhere to be quarantined and a new detainee was moved in.\n\nHe said:\"The way we're being treated is disgusting. People are moving in and out of cells.... without [the cells] being cleaned.\n\n\"I felt sorry for the [detainee that was moved in], the person knew nothing about the cell\", he said.\n\nThe Home Office says bedrooms are deep-cleaned after a detainee has left isolation and handwashing facilities are available in all immigration removal centres.\n\nA detainee in Brook House says he saw a man who served food in the canteen be escorted by staff to isolation.  He said the man was so breathless that he couldn't walk by himself.\n\n\"He had been serving food the day before,\"he said.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has been told by immigration lawyers that the Home Office has continued to arrest people and place them in IRCs, including in the last few days. \n\nHowever, the lawyers have told the BBC there is an inability to remove people to their countries of origin because of a lack of deportation flights.\n\nToufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis solicitors says\"it is now abundantly clear the Secretary of State has no lawful basis to detain simply because removals can no longer take place.\"\n\n'Danger to public health'\n\nMr Hossain says a client of his legal firm who is living with HIV was detained as recently as last week.\n\nAnother detainee has told the BBC he was arrested in early March with a cough and a fever, but was still transferred to Morton Hall IRC in Lincolnshire.\n\nHe was asked by a nurse - who was wearing no personal protective equipment - why he had been sent there given that he was displaying symptoms. He has since tested negative and been released.\n\nBella Sankey, from the Detention Action campaign group which is taking the legal action in the High Court, says IRCs need to be closed immediately.\n\n\"These are not closed centres, they're not like cruise ships, staff go in and out of detention centres as visitors, and indeed the majority of people detained in our immigration estate will eventually be released back into the community,\"she said.\n\n\"It's not only inhumane to carry on detaining people in these circumstances, but it's actually a danger to public health nationally.\"\n\nThe BBC understands that around 900 detainees were in the UK's immigration removal centres last Friday, after the release of 300 people last week.\n\nLater on Wednesday, in the High Court, Detention Action is taking legal action against the Home Office. \n\nA government statement said:\"Decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders.\"\nTL;DR: Three immigration removal centres in the UK are housing people with symptoms of coronavirus, the BBC has been told.\n\nArticle: On American Public Media's Marketplace programme, Janet Yellen said Mr Trump did not understand economic policy or the US Federal Reserve's purpose. \n\nShe also said that Mr Trump's focus on the US-China trade deficit was misguided. \n\nThe US and China have been in a year-long dispute, which has seen the imposition of trade tariffs.\n\nMs Yellen, who left the Fed in 2018 and is now at the Brookings Institution research group, also said President Trump's attacks on current Fed chair Jerome Powell were harmful to the public's confidence in the central bank. \n\nAsked on Marketplace, the BBC's US radio partner, if she thought the president had a grasp of macroeconomic policy, she replied:\"No, I do not.\"\n\nShe went on to say Mr Trump did not seem to understand the Fed's two responsibilities of controlling inflation and supporting employment. \n\n\"Well, I doubt that he would even be able to say that the Fed's goals are maximum employment and price stability, which is the goals that Congress have assigned to the Fed,\"Ms Yellen told the programme. \n\nOn the trade gap with China, she said:\"When I continually hear focus by the president and some of his advisers on remedying bilateral trade deficits with other trade partners, I think almost any economist would tell you that there's no real meaning to bilateral trade deficits, and it's not an appropriate objective of policy.\"\n\nMr Powell declined to comment on his predecessor's remarks about Mr Trump.\n\nAppearing in front of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Housing Affairs Committee, Mr Powell told Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown who asked about Ms Yellen's remarks:\"I won't have any comment on that for you senator.\"\n\nMs Yellen was appointed as Fed chair by President Obama in 2014 and was the first woman to hold the position. \n\nPresidents traditionally keep the Federal Reserve chair who is in charge when they take office in place, but President Trump, as in so many cases, did not stick with that. \n\nOne reason was thought to be her perceived resistance to deregulating the financial sector.\n\nBinding agreement?\n\nThe president was involved in a public spat with his own trade adviser during a media conference on the US-China talks late last week.\n\nMr Trump professed himself not\"a fan\"of the standard Memorandum of Understandings (MOU) that are used when drawing up trade deals.\n\nSix MOUs have been drawn up between the US and China as part of their moves towards a new trade deal. \n\nBut Mr Trump said:\"I don't like MOUs because they don't mean anything. To me they don't mean anything. I think you're better off just going into a document. I was never... a fan of an MOU.\"\n\nHis trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, contradicted him, saying:\"An MOU is a contract. It's the way trade agreements are generally used... A Memorandum of Understanding is a binding agreement between two people. \n\n\"It's a legal term, it's a contract.\"\nTL;DR: A former chair of the US central bank has sharply criticised President Trump's economic knowledge.\n\nArticle: By Paul GribbenBBC News\n\nIt uses technology to transform black and white archive footage of soldiers into a visceral, full-colour documentary - and is probably the nearest thing we'll get to travelling back in time.\n\nThe reaction from the students was immediate, Mr Rogers says. \n\n\"They were in awe when the colour kicked in and the screen expanded. You should have seen the look on their faces. I had to say to them,'This is not acting, that's real people.' \n\n\"They had studied World War One in Year 9 so they had the context to the conflict but this was real life, the war brought to life through the voices, the faces, the camaraderie, even details like the latrines.\"\n\nMr Rogers, who's English, teaches history at an international school in northern Spain. The reaction of his students was as varied as their nationalities.\n\nBlanco Gros Pereira, who's Spanish, expressed surprise that young men were\"willing to lie about their age to get in - kids of 14. They weren't scared of getting killed - they said they knew there was a job to do and accepted the risks.\"\n\nChinese national Ana Cassidy Bermudez, said she was shocked to see soldiers\"laughing one minute together and then to see them dead the next. It was devastating and really brought home to me like nothing else the brutality of WWI.\"\n\nAmerican Gaby Holt admitted to being confused at the programme's end when soldiers\"said they felt out of a job and didn't want to go home. I expected them to be desperate to go home but they were upset as if they'd been fired from a job.\n\n\"My understanding of the war was that everyone would have been overjoyed to go home at the end.\"\n\nEach frame of the film was hand-coloured and the footage 3D-digitised to allow the viewer to see and hear the troops as we imagine they really were.  \n\nJackson used forensic lip-readers to find out what the soldiers were saying and then had actors voice their words. \n\nThe programme was watched by 2.1 million people on the evening of Remembrance Sunday - and audiences have until Sunday 18 to catch it on BBC iPlayer.   \n\nActor and children's author David Walliams described it as\"one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen\", adding that it brings\"the horror and futility of WWI to life in a way I have never seen before\".\n\nOthers on Twitter were also keen to add their praise:\n\nAnother viewer, Chris Roe-Bullion, from Essex, says he believes it should be shown\"as it is\"to secondary school students with some editing needed for those at primary schools. \n\nA Scout leader with family who served in both world wars, he says he learned a lot.\n\n\"I had some idea about the conditions but I had no idea just how awful they were. The image that sticks in my mind is of a hand in the mud - it looks like someone reaching for help as they were sucked down. It brought an absolute lump to my throat.\n\n\"That thought of people falling to the ground and disappearing beneath the mud. You almost hope that someone took a rifle to spare them.\n\n\"I also did not realise how divided the Germans were amongst themselves - Saxons hating the Prussians and so forth.\"\n\nChris stayed up long after the programme finished on BBC2, mulling it over and thinking of how many soldiers signed up\"really believing that they were going on a'great big adventure'\".\n\n\"We had about 200 people turning out for our local Remembrance Sunday event - Scouts, British Legion and others. Having watched this programme, I know that we can never forget.\"\n\nAnother viewer, Sue Rhodes, thinks British society can become desensitised to conflicts the further away they are in time and the film is an antidote to that.\n\n\"I only planned to watch 10 or 15 minutes and see what people's reactions were but I ended up watching it all. That moment when the programme went from silent to sound and colour - it literally took my breath away. So moving. \n\n\"When you see black and white, it is almost as if they are not real people but this really brought home the realities to you - the bodies, the death scenes, the injuries.\"\n\nRyan O'Sullivan, a British-based Australian of Irish origin, agrees it's important for young people in particular to watch the programme and draw lessons from it.\n\n\"Teenagers and people in their twenties - they should thank their lucky stars.

The protest grew into the biggest march seen in the city in recent times as we walked to the South African Reserve Bank branch, our first stop. \n\nThe cantankerous Mr Malema told the bank officials who were brave enough to come out and receive the memorandum, that he wanted zero charges on bank fees for the poor and the aged. \n\nIn the scorching heat we then proceeded to the Chamber of Mines. \n\nAs usual, he did not hold back when he told the chamber's official that the EFF wants to\"nationalise the mines\". \n\nI asked Malema how many years he plans to keep marching against the ruling ANC. \n\nHe told me:\"It won't be long. We want to own the means of production. The time of the ANC is over.\"\n\nIt was when he reached the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, in Africa's richest square mile Sandton, that he showed his true colours. \n\nHe told Stock Exchange CEO Nicky Newton-King:\"We are not Mandela. We do not preach reconciliation. We want remorse.\"\n\nAnd it is precisely because of this line that I asked myself the question: Are we at the cusp of the second revolution?\n\nStudent protests\n\nBut this is not just about Malema. This is about the people of the Republic of South Africa. \n\nI also walked with university students from Wits and UJ (University of Johannesburg) who were campaigning against a rise in fees.\n\nChanting a 21st century slogan #FeesMustFall, this was an organic uprising - similar to one I witnessed in Soweto back in June 1976. \n\nI saw something I had never witnessed in South African politics. There was no ANC or any other political party that was behind the protest. \n\nThe students took it upon themselves to lead their own struggle without any political party influence.\n\nIn fact, they were marching against the ANC, the oldest liberation movement on the African continent. \n\nIt felt to me like a country truly coming of age. After 21 years, South Africans were rising against the party credited with delivering freedom from white minority rule.\n\nThe students ended up right at the top, marching to the seat of power in the nation's capital in Pretoria. \n\nThey demanded that President Jacob Zuma come down from his office at the Union Buildings to address them. \n\nHe was locked in a long meeting with university management and student leaders. \n\nSome in the crowd started burning mobile toilet facilities and breached a fence separating the masses from the riot police. \n\nThe police responded by firing stun grenades and tear gas. \n\nSocial movement\n\nAll of this unfolded exactly where I was standing 21 years before on 10 May when Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the first democratically-elected president of a free South Africa. \n\nPlacards were not limited to fees only. Many of them read\"down with corruption\".\n\nIt was a protest about inequality, and the lack of integrity of the government.\n\nThe question is whether the current political leadership can transform the status quo where the vast wealth of the country is concentrated in the hands of the few.\n\nService delivery protests have always been localised, but with #FeesMustFall we are seeing the birth of an embryonic national social movement.\n\nProfessor Somadoda Fikeni, an expert on the ANC, says the current leaders do not have the capacity to deal with the radical transformation of South Africa. \n\nHe told me:\"They lack a deep political conviction. Everything they do is at a technical minimum requirement of what is expected of them. They have a preoccupation of maintaining the lifestyle they possess.\n\n\"Some of them may be politically leftist, but if you look closely at their lifestyle you soon realise that they cannot change the prevailing levels of inequality.\n\n\"It is not in their interest to violently shake the tree that feeds them.\"\n\nTo understand how we got here, one has to go back to the end of apartheid.\n\nUnrealised expectations\n\nNelson Mandela negotiated a political settlement, but the people expected more than politics - they hoped for justice, equality and redistribution of wealth.\n\nBut wealth is still concentrated in the hands of the few. A recent survey by the department of trade and industry - disputed by the JSE - found only 3% of South Africa's economy is black-owned. \n\nOrdinary people are in despair, still facing high unemployment, poverty and inequality. \n\nDon't get me wrong - many achievements have come with the end of apartheid. \n\nSouth Africa has one of the largest black middle class in the world outside the US. \n\nProgrammes such as affirmative action and Broad Based Economic Empowerment have helped to lift whole communities out of poverty. \n\nHowever, there are millions of black people who are left behind, wondering whether their freedom will ever come. \n\nWhen I covered the multi-party talks soon after Mandela's release many people were repeating the same line:\"We are different. We are not like the rest of Africa.\"\n\nPart of the reason for that was the way the people had forgiven the perpetrators of apartheid through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nJulius Malema:\n\nBut now that sense of pride is slowly fading away as corruption, xenophobia and big political blunders become the order of the day. \n\nOne politician who was part of the negotiation team tells me:\"We are no different from the rest of Africa. We are ordinary. There's nothing special about us.\"\n\nLike many others at the time of euphoria, I too believed that the South African experience would be totally different from what we have witnessed in post-colonial wars on the continent.\n\nMillions remain optimistic. \n\nHowever, there are many others who think before things get better in South Africa they might have to get worse first.\nTL;DR: As South Africa enters its 22nd year since the end of apartheid it seems another revolution is at hand. Or is it?\n\nArticle: Stagecoach and its partners were barred from running three franchises by the Department for Transport (DfT) last month.\n\nThe DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules.\n\nThe claim alleges that the DfT breached its statutory duties, which include a\"fair\"tendering process.\n\nStagecoach is taking the legal action forward through its West Coast Trains Partnership Ltd business, in which Stagecoach has a 50% share, with French state-owned operator SNCF holding 30% and Virgin 20%. \n\nIt is also demanding a judicial review. \n\nThe DfT said it would\"robustly defend\"the outcomes of its competition processes. \n\nA spokesperson said Stagecoach\"knowingly submitted non-compliant bids\", and while the department would not comment on legal proceedings, it had\"total confidence\"in its franchising procedure.\n\nPublic procurement expert Andrew Dean, of law firm Clifford Chance, said a court was\"unlikely to interfere\"with the DfT's disqualification decision,\"unless Stagecoach can put forward strong evidence\".\n\nReaching an out-of-court settlement with Stagecoach may prove difficult for the DfT, as it would potentially encourage other disgruntled operators to launch similar challenges.\n\nLabour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald took aim at his counterpart Chris Grayling, saying that Stagecoach's move\"shows that this system is beyond reform\". \n\n\"Only Labour's plans to unite track and trains in one public company can deliver the affordable fares and reliable rail services passengers deserve.,\"he added.\n\nPensions shortfall\n\nEarlier this month, Stagecoach said it had begun a similar proceeding after losing the East Midlands franchise. \n\nMinisters had disqualified Stagecoach from re-bidding for the franchise - which has services running to Lincoln, Liverpool, Norwich and Nottingham - after DfT raised concerns about its pension commitments.\n\nBidders for the franchises have been asked to bear full long-term funding risk on relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme, Stagecoach has said.\n\nThe Pensions Regulator has estimated the UK rail industry needs an additional \u00a35-6bn to plug the pensions shortfall, while the company has said it was being asked to take on risks it\"cannot control and manage\".\n\nRail firms have called on the government to help make up the pensions deficit.\n\nMartin Griffiths, Stagecoach chief executive, said:\"We believe the rail system should be about appointing the best operator for customers, not about passing unquantifiable, unmanageable and inappropriate risk to train companies.\"\n\nVirgin boss Sir Richard Branson said last month that his train business could disappear from the UK after Stagecoach was barred from the three rail franchise bids, which also included South Eastern.\nTL;DR: UK rail operator Stagecoach is to take the government to court over its disqualification from running the West Coast Partnership franchise from 2020.\n\nArticle: NASUWT and Ucac joined criticism of a Welsh Government ruling that schools and colleagues should decide if face coverings are needed.\n\nUnions said the decision risks confusion and comes too close to the start of the autumn term next week.\n\nBut Education Minister Kirsty Williams said headteachers were the right people to decide.\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price urged ministers to withdraw the guidance and issue\"clear directions\".\n\nThree councils have now said they will recommend the use of masks - Cardiff, Carmarthenshire and Isle of Anglesey.\n\nFace coverings are recommended for children aged 11 and over in communal areas indoors where social distancing is difficult, and on school buses, when schools return next week.\n\nBut the Welsh Government has declined to make their use mandatory, instead instructing individual schools and colleges to make risk assessments.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils will have to wear masks in corridors and communal areas, as they will in parts of England under local lockdown measures.\n\nThe guidance changed after the World Health Organization (WHO) said those over 12 should wear masks in the same settings as adults.\n\nWhat have unions said?\n\nOn Wednesday headteachers union NAHT Cymru said it was\"unacceptable\"that headteachers had to make the decision, as they were\"not medical experts\".\n\nThere was support for the move from the NEU, but Jonathan Lewis of Unison said:\"Welsh Government should have given clear guidance on this and followed the chief medical officer's recommendation.\n\n\"Leaving it to local authorities and schools to decide is likely to create a great deal of inconsistency throughout Wales.\"\n\nThe announcement\"runs the risk of causing uncertainty and confusion,\"claimed NASUWT's Patrick Roach.\n\n\"If wearing face masks or face coverings in schools is now deemed appropriate in order to safeguard health and safety, then it is difficult to understand why this practice has not been made compulsory.\"\n\nUcac said the decision came\"far too late\".\n\n\"It is extremely disappointing that this announcement comes only two days before the start of term, as our headteachers will have to revisit their risk assessments and all school safety procedures to check the need for the use of face coverings and that they are kept or disposed of correctly,\"it said.\n\n\"It is also disappointing that the Welsh Government has not made the wearing of face coverings compulsory, thereby providing our school leadership teams with a further responsibility.\"\n\nWhat have councils said so far?\n\nSecondary school children in Carmarthenshire will be required to wear face coverings on school transport and in school indoor communal areas.\n\nCardiff Council said it is\"strongly recommending\"that all school staff and mainstream secondary school pupils wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and toilets and all situations where social distancing cannot be observed.\n\nThe council said it will give school staff and secondary school pupil two re-useable masks at the start of term, and will require their use on school transport.\n\nAnglesey council said it also recommended the use of masks where\"social distancing cannot be maintained\"in secondary schools, and by children aged 11 and up on school transport.\n\n'My degree is in history, not biomedical science'\n\nJustin O'Sullivan, head teacher at Cardinal Newman Catholic School in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he was unhappy with the timing of the decision.\n\n\"What we've got now is a situation where heads and local authorities are running around trying to interpret what recommended means, [and make] decisions about where communal areas are safe, and when they're not safe.\n\n\"We're not scientists, we're educators. My degree is in history, it is not in biomedical science or anything like that.\n\n\"It says in the guidance that we should be consulting with parents, unions, stakeholders, governors, and I've got pupils back in next Wednesday.\n\n\"How I'm supposed to do a risk assessment, a comprehensive plan, consult on it, get it out in that time, amazes me.\"\n\nSpeaking as he was in the process of making a risk assessment, he said he was telling parents it was\"almost certain\"that pupils would be asked to wear masks for some part of the school day.\n\nHeadteachers'experts in wellbeing of children'\n\nMs Williams defended the decision, saying masks were not currently necessary\"as community transmission rates remained low\".\n\n\"Things can change very quickly, we may indeed have to move to a situation where we have to mandate,\"she said.\n\nBut she said having pupils wearing face masks in canteens, corridors and communal areas was problematic, with storage issues, and pupils taking them on and off, with concerns that they should not\"create a biohazard around schools\".\n\n\"There are considerations about bullying of children,\"she said.\n\n\"Some children a face covering will not be suitable for, perhaps for personal medical reasons that maybe the rest of the school or their school mates are not aware of at the time.\"\n\nMs Williams said schools should get pupils to wear them if they could not maintain social-distancing in corridors and stop pupils\"bumping into each other\".\n\nBut the minister argued headteachers were the right people to make the decision, as they were\"experts in the health and wellbeing and education of our children\"and the government guidance was\"very clear\".\n\n\"Welsh education is incredibly diverse, each and every one of our secondary schools finds themselves in a very different position, and it is impossible at this stage, with transmission rates low to have a blanket decision,\"she said.\n\n\"I believe we are much more likely to have a greater compliance and to use face coverings successfully if we allow those people on the ground to make the decisions.\"\n\nDuring the interview on BBC Radio Wales, Ms Williams said face coverings\"can be made at home, out of material or purchased\".\n\nNAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said it\"beggars belief to hear ministers talk about making their own masks\"when the Welsh Government's website said many home made masks\"offer little or no protection\".\n\n\"If we are receiving mixed messages on this from government then how are headteachers supposed to make informed decisions?\"\n\nThe WHO recommends three-ply coverings.\n\nEnsuring the correct masks are worn would mean they need to be supplied, Mrs Doel added, calling for the government to step in.\n\n\"The cost implications alone of such a measure will be significant, assuming they are going to be available.\"\n\n'Children don't need added worry'\n\nMother-of-three Ceri Reed said that she feared that if cases rose in certain communities schools\"would be hung out to dry\".\n\n\"It's a national crisis, it requires a national approach,\"she said.\n\nMs Reed, from Parents' Voices in Wales, said she wanted to see a blanket approach but with an exception for individual pupils who may have additional needs or mental health issues, who may find it hard.\n\n\"Many children will have had some trauma and bereavement during the lockdown and they do not need this added worry of the infection transmission sitting next to a peer in class,\"she said.\n\nWhat has Plaid Cymru said?\n\nPlaid Cymru's leader is calling on the first minister to withdraw guidance issued to schools on facing coverings and\"re-issue clear directions\".\n\nIn a letter to Mark Drakeford, Mr Price said minsters'\"hands off approach\"to the matter\"will mean that individual schools and individual local authorities will be left on their own\".\n\n\"This seems to me to be incompatible with the partnership approach -

He had no choice but to say a\"surreal\"goodbye to his beloved 92-year-old mum, Helen, via an online live stream.\n\n\"I really cannot describe the sadness and grief I've felt over the last few weeks, we always thought we were only 24 hours from being home,\"Andrew says.\n\nWhen his mother was taken to hospital after a fall four weeks ago, Andrew and his wife, Anu, 49, searched for flights to Australia, only to find that by the time they could fly there, and finish Australia's mandatory two-week quarantine, they would still be\"weeks too late\"to see his mother.\n\nHeartbroken at being separated from his mum and four siblings in Australia, Andrew and Anu recorded video messages for his sister to show Helen before she died.\n\n\"We told her how much we loved and missed her, and talked about some of the happy memories we'd had together,\"he says. \n\nAfter a\"very emotional\"funeral, Andrew is still struggling to come to terms with his mother's death.\"I don't know if we've really dealt with it from here, it just feels too detached\".\n\nAndrew's experience is one of thousands of stories of heartbreak, anger and separation - after Australia adopted some of the toughest travel restrictions in the world.\n\nIn March, its government urged Australian citizens and residents living overseas who wanted to return home to do so as soon as they could. \n\nDays later, the country closed its borders to everyone except Australian citizens and permanent residents. \n\nThe government has restricted people from leaving the country without an exemption, and few are given. All arrivals into Australia must quarantine in a designated hotel for 14 days, at a rough cost of about $3,000 (\u00a31,650) per adult.\n\nAustralia also brought in strict limits on the number of arrivals allowed to enter the country - with a cap of about 4,000 people per week. And airlines - who must comply with the caps - have been regularly cancelling flights and tickets.\n\nAbout 27,000 Australians stranded overseas have registered with the government to come home, Australian officials have said. But earlier this month, the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia - which represents airlines - estimated there were likely to be 100,000 Australians stranded overseas, including 30,000 in the UK.\n\n'I was told to find a homeless shelter'\n\nFor Sandi James, a PhD researcher, qualified psychologist and teacher, what was supposed to be a 10-day working trip to Dublin has turned into months of being stranded in the UK with no job or stable accommodation.\n\nSandi, 51, travelled from Australia to a conference in Dublin in March, where her wife Jennifer, 54, joined her from Thailand. \n\nSandi was then due to travel to Malaysia for work - but says hours before she could board the plane, the country closed its borders. Thailand did the same that month.\n\nSandi travelled to London after being offered a room to stay in while she was waiting to return to Australia. She tried to book a flight home in April, but the earliest she could get one was 6 July.\n\nWith no job or permanent place to live, she phoned the Australian High Commission in London for help, but says they told her to contact a local council about homeless accommodation.\"I hung up the phone. I just couldn't speak. I wanted to scream at them.\"\n\nThe Commission did not respond to the BBC's request for a response to this claim.\n\nAfter her first flight was cancelled, Sandi was unable to take another last minute flight and says she has\"given up\"on trying to get back to Australia.\n\nSandi, who is currently staying in a hostel in Bristol, says the whole ordeal has severely damaged her mental health. She has now started the expensive process of applying for an ancestry visa in the UK, in a bid to secure work, and hopefully bring Jennifer here.\n\n\"I am stuck here alone, and am really struggling. I can't do this on my own anymore, I need her.\"\n\nFor first-time mum Carly McCrossin, 38, every day her five-month-old daughter, Ailish, grows is a heart-wrenching reminder that her family back in Australia are missing out on those special moments.\n\n\"I was getting so upset, because I would be putting away her new-born clothes,\"she says,\"and bringing out the three-month age clothes.\"\n\nHer mother was due to fly to the UK before Carly gave birth. But during a\"horrible\"phone call, Carly and her husband, who live in south London, agreed she shouldn't come to the UK, fearing she may get stranded here - a decision they had just hours to make before the borders closed.\n\nUnable to\"do nothing\", she has launched a campaign, Fly the Babies Home, with the aim of chartering a plane to fly other lockdown babies to Australia to meet their families.\n\nWith 400 families registered so far, Carly has begun the\"slow process of getting things to happen\", including talking to airlines and charter companies. So far the cheapest private charter quote came in at about \u20ac900,000 (\u00a3497,000) for a return.\n\nThe Australian government is due to review the caps on people coming into the country on 24 October and recently said it will increase capacity to about 6,000 people per week. But many stranded Australians say this is not enough.\n\nAnd it could be too late for Carly. She had planned to fly home with Ailish in October for three months before returning to the UK in January. \n\nInstead she's left looking at baby clothes that no longer fit her daughter.\"I just kept asking myself, how has my mum not seen my baby?\"\nTL;DR: Last Thursday, Andrew Leslie, 52, woke up at 04:30 BST at his east London home for his mother's funeral.

He said that there may have been similar disappearances after earlier ceremonies.  \n\nThe official in charge of rehabilitation, Brigadier Dharshana Hettiarachchi, said earlier that all the young people were handed to their families.  \n\nBut he has now told the BBC that he is\"looking into\"these cases and asked concerned parents to visit him.  \n\nBrig Hettiarachchi acknowledged there was no registration or signing process when alleged ex-combatants rejoin their families.\n\nInterviewed by the Indian paper The Hindu on Wednesday, the mother of one of the three missing men, Saroja Devi, from Mullaitivu, said her son had once been conscripted by the Tamil Tigers but escaped rebel-held territory by boat from Mullaitivu in July 2008.  \n\nShe said he had surrendered to the navy but she had never seen him again until recognising him and two friends in the photograph taken at the ceremony.\n\nMost official\"handover\"ceremonies have taken place in northern Sri Lanka - but the one on 30 September was at Temple Trees, office of the Sri Lankan president, in the presence of several foreign ambassadors. Some 1,800 former rebel cadres were said to be present. \n\nThe rehabilitation department told the BBC that no-one is now being held for rehabilitation for longer than a year and that there are currently about 660 alleged ex-combatants undergoing the process.\nTL;DR: Three Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebels who took part in a rehabilitation ceremony last year may subsequently have been taken away by the authorities, a rights campaigner has said.\n\nArticle: The suicide attack took place outside the Imam Hossein Mosque, Irna reported.\n\nThe militant Sunni Muslim group Jundullah claimed responsibility for the bombing. \n\nThe province of Sistan-Baluchistan is prone to unrest, with the mainly Sunni population often claiming discrimination by Shias.\n\nThe attack reportedly targeted pilgrims marking Ashura, the Shia mourning day.\n\nA number of women and children are believed to be among the dead. \n\nMany more people were injured. \n\nIrna quoted the head of the Chabahar Security Council, Ali Bateni, as saying there were two attackers and one had been arrested.\n\nState television reported there had been two explosions but Mr Bateni said there had been only one.\n\nAshura commemorates the death in the 7th Century of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson.\n\nJundullah (Soldiers of God), which says it is fighting for the culture and faith of the ethnic Baluch people, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on its website. \n\nLast month the group was designated a terrorist organisation by the US.\n\nTehran often accuses the US of using militants in the region as mercenaries to attack Iran's interests.\n\nIn July, 27 people were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in the provincial capital, Zahedan.\n\nJundullah said that attack was in response to the execution of its leader, Abdolmalek Rigi, in June.\n\nIn October 2009, Jundullah said it was behind a suicide bombing that killed 31 people, including several top commanders of the elite Revolutionary Guards, in the Pishin region of Sistan-Baluchistan.\n\nSistan-Baluchistan is one of Iran's most deprived provinces and its location also makes it a key route in the international drugs trade.\nTL;DR: A bomb explosion in the south-eastern Iranian city of Chabahar has killed at least 39 people, the official Iranian news agency says.\n\nArticle: Tariq Hussain, 32, of the city's Hollings Terrace, was jailed at Bradford Crown Court on Friday.\n\nHe had earlier admitted conspiracy to evade prohibition on the importation of a controlled drug and possessing a drug with intent to supply.\n\nThe picture frames were recovered by police from Hussain's car last June.\n\nOfficers found a large package containing five pictures with frames during a search of the vehicle on Bradford's Kensington Street Street.\n\nThey were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) laboratory in Wetherby, where 0.8kg of 100% pure heroin was discovered inside the frames.\n\n'Challenging' case\n\nPolice said the package was believed to have arrived in the UK from Pakistan shortly before it was seized.\n\nHussain was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison.\n\nDet Insp Noel Devine from West Yorkshire Police, who led the investigation, said:\"This was a very sophisticated way to import such high purity drugs in to the UK and just shows what lengths some are prepared to go to.\n\n\"It is hard to put a value on a drug of this purity, and it is even more difficult to estimate how much profit can be made by criminals, but I would think it could easily be in excess of half a million pounds.\n\nJulian Dunnill, a senior forensic scientist who was involved with the case, said:\"This was one of the most challenging drug concealment cases I have worked on.\n\n\"In my 21-year career with the FSS I have dealt with many importation cases, but this is the first time I have found drugs hidden in this way.\"\nTL;DR: A Bradford man has been jailed for more than seven years after almost a kilo of pure heroin was found concealed inside picture frames.\n\nArticle: The body of the 25-year-old was discovered in a wooded area at the edge of the Bestival site in Dorset in the early hours.\n\nPolice said they were called shortly before 01:00 BST amid concern for welfare of the woman, from London.\n\nA 28-year-old man from London has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is being questioned by police.\n\nA cordon remains in place at the festival site while forensic examinations take place.\n\nDorset Police said the woman's family and the coroner had been informed.\n\nA post-mortem examination is to be carried out to establish the cause of death.\n\nDet Ch Insp Sarah Derbyshire said:\"Following the discovery of the woman's body we have now launched an investigation into her death. We have specially trained officers supporting her family at this very difficult time.\n\n\"We are working closely with the festival organisers and I would appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to contact Dorset Police.\"\n\nOn Sunday the festival arenas were temporarily evacuated as high winds battered the site.\nTL;DR: A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was found dead at a festival in Dorset.\n\nArticle: It comes after the firm tried to combine into a Dutch company in 2018.\n\nThat plan, which some suggested was linked to Brexit, was abandoned after UK shareholders objected.\n\nUnilever said no jobs would be lost in the latest move, and its existing headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands would stay where they were.\n\n'Lacklustre sales'\n\n\"It's a big departure from the failed plans of 2018, when the group sought a single listing in Amsterdam,\"said Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n\"Unilever's sales have been lacklustre of late, and the pursuit of a single listing is Unilever's way of making sure it's in the best possible shape to start the difficult process of rejuvenation.\"\n\nHowever, she added that the\"big question\" was whether shareholders in the Netherlands would try to block the plans, as their British counterparts did in 2018. \n\nCurrently the two firms' shares are listed independently in London and Amsterdam, with slightly more of the value of the joint enterprise held in the Netherlands.\n\nShareholders object \n\nThis led to the original proposal of making it a Dutch firm, which some speculated was linked to Brexit - claims the firm denied.\n\nThe news came as some banks said they planned to move assets and personnel out of London ahead of the UK's exit from the European Union as they feared losing access to EU markets.\n\nLater in 2018, when it became clear that Unilever would lose its place in the index of Britain's top 100 companies, the FTSE 100, UK shareholders objected and the deal faltered.\n\nThe new structure will make it a legally simpler business under Unilever PLC. The board will meet in London, whereas before it would alternate between its two homes.\n\nThe company's unusual current structure comes from the merger 90 years ago of soap maker Lever Brothers and Dutch spreads maker Margarine Unie. The firms became Unilever PLC and Unilever NV.\n\nReports of the death of the City of London as the centre of European finance appear to have been greatly exaggerated. Unilever's decision to end its unusual two-country corporate structure after 90 years is, at its heart, a triumph of money (the City) over politics (Brexit). \n\nUnilever has been under pressure from shareholders to simplify its structure for more than a decade. Many investors have thought the complexity cost money, made it difficult to shed poorly performing divisions, or made the company unattractive to potential suitors. \n\nTwo years ago, in the wake of a takeover approach from America's Kraft Heinz, Unilever decided it would bow to pressure. It would move its corporate headquarters to Rotterdam - the only problem being that the move would mean it would have to be removed from the FTSE 100 index of the largest companies listed in London. Shareholders were far from happy, and quickly put a stop to the move.\n\nUnilever has since continued with the simplification plan, and has arrived at a predictable conclusion. The Dutch arm will be subsumed into the UK entity, and the new parent company will be Unilever PLC. It remains to be seen whether the government of Netherlands will try and overturn the decision. For the moment, however, the power of the City has prevailed.\nTL;DR: Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Dove soap, is to combine its two businesses into one structure in the UK.\n\nArticle: He was defending the 11 new bills that make up the coalition's plans for its final year in power before an election.\n\nHighlights include pension reforms, new rights for fracking firms and limited power to recall misbehaving MPs.\n\nLabour sources said it was\"staggering\"that the NHS and immigration were not mentioned in the Queen's Speech.\n\nEd Miliband said the speech failed to match the scale of the challenges Britain faces. The Labour leader told MPs:\"We would have a Queen's Speech with legislation which would make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes again in Britain. \n\n\"A Queen's Speech which signals a new direction for Britain, not one which offers more of the same.\"\n\nMr Cameron said the government's\"long-term economic plan is working but there is much, much more to do,\"adding that it would\"take the rest of this Parliament and the next to finish the task of turning our country around\".\n\nHe accused Mr Miliband of having a\"rag bag, pick-and-mix selection of statist Seventies ideas\", describing them as a\"revival of Michael Foot's policies paid for by (Unite union leader) Len McCluskey's money\".\n\nAmong the measures announced were:\n\nThe Queen presided over the state opening of Parliament for the 63rd time, amid the traditional pomp and ceremony.\n\n\"My government's legislative programme will continue to deliver on its long-term plan to build a stronger economy and a fairer society,\"she said in a speech written for her by ministers.\n\n\"To strengthen the economy and provide stability and security, my ministers will continue to reduce the country's deficit, helping to ensure that mortgage and interest rates remain low.\"\n\nThere was a moment of drama towards the end of the speech when one of the Queen's page boys, who carry her train as she arrives and leaves the chamber, appeared to faint.\n\n A loud thud could be heard in the House of Lords, as she spoke of the need to work towards a\"comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran\".\n\n The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, who were sat nearest to the boy, showed concern as help was called to assist him and he was carried out of the chamber. \n\nMPs are debating the planned legislation in the Commons. \n\nIn a joint statement released alongside the speech, Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg took steps to reject the idea that the months leading up to next May's general election would be dominated by Conservative and Lib Dem wrangling.\n\nThe PM and deputy PM said the coalition was\"still taking bold steps\"to\"take Britain forward to a brighter future\". \n\n\"We may be two parties, with two different philosophies but we understand one thing,\"they added. \n\n\"Countries rise when their people rise. So this Queen's Speech is unashamedly pro-work, pro-business and pro-aspiration.\"\n\nSpeculation ahead of the speech that it could include a fresh crackdown on immigration, in the wake of UKIP's success in the European and local elections, proved groundless.\n\nBut it did include a renewed commitment to the Help to Buy scheme, following criticism from the European Commission and others that it is fuelling an unsustainable housing boom. The Speech also repeated David Cameron's commitment to promote reform of the European Union\"including a stronger role for member states and national parliaments\".\n\nPlans to support the development of shale gas by the\"fracking\"process are among the most controversial measures included in the Speech.\n\nEnough to kill off Labour's'zombie government' claim?\n\nAnalysis by Iain Watson\n\nJust about every Labour MP who has graced a broadcast studio has denounced the coalition as a\"zombie government\". The dictionary describes such a creature as\"mute and listless\"with only\"the semblance of life\". Zombies, that is, not MPs. The evidence? Well, there are fewer bills being proposed since\u2026 er, the last year of the last Labour government, under Gordon Brown. Fans of the horror genre will be aware that zombies may well be listless - but they are not benign, and can often harm living beings. What will really be causing Labour nightmares won't be any lack of new bills by a\"zombie\"government. It will be whether, with signs of an economic recovery, the government - and primarily the Conservatives - will remain more trusted to hold the nation's purse strings by the time of the general election.  \n\nGreenpeace activists, who say the Infrastructure Bill will clear the way for fracking firms to drill under people's land and property without their permission, staged a protest at David Cameron's Oxfordshire home.\n\nThe activists erected security fencing around the prime minister's cottage in the Cotswold hamlet of Dean and put up a sign saying:\"We apologise for any inconvenience we may cause while we frack under your home\".\n\nThe state opening of Parliament, one of the highlights of the Westminster calendar, used to take place in the autumn but was moved to the early summer by the coalition government. This year saw the Queen travel to the event in her new Diamond Jubilee carriage.\n\nWheel\n\nStone\n\nWood\n\nCrown\n\nCarriage technology\n\nWheel\n\n\n\nThe wheels - cast in aircraft aluminium - feature the name of coach designer and builder Australian Jim Frecklington.  It was originally intended to reach the Queen in time for her 80th birthday, but various delays meant it took 10 years to complete. It has been bought by the Royal Collection Trust for an undisclosed sum and will go on display at the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace.\n\nStone of Destiny\n\n\n\nA piece of the Stone of Destiny, used for centuries in the coronation of monarchs, is set into a panel below the seats. The seats themselves are upholstered in pastel gold-coloured silk brocade. Other decorations include a bolt from a Spitfire, a musket ball from the battle of Waterloo and a fragment of a 617 Squadron Dambuster.

The idea was promised in the 2010 coalition agreement but was thought to have been dropped after rows between senior Conservative and Lib Dem ministers.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, a recall will only be triggered if MPs are given jail sentences of less than 12 months or if the House of Commons resolves that they have engaged in\"serious wrongdoing\". Voters would then have to collect the signatures of 10% of constituents to force a by-election.\n\nConservative backbencher Zac Goldsmith, who has been campaigning for tougher recall powers, said the proposed bill was\"worse than meaningless\"because a committee of MPs would still have the final say. \n\nHe said it would be\"a waste of Parliament's time\"unless it can be amended.\n\nJames Landale on historical significance of the occasion\n\n\"As you watch the state opening of parliament, remember it is one of the strongest ceremonial demonstrations of our liberty that we have. Democracy is not just the freedom to vote out a government we dislike; it is also the freedom not to be ruled by an autocratic monarch chosen by God. It is what our ancestors fought over in the civil war. And it is a right that we are reminded of every year.\"James Landale on how the Queen's Speech show us who isn't boss.\n\nLiberal Democrat president Tim Farron said that the Queen's Speech was\"very substantial\", telling the BBC's World at One:\"I suspect the pensions proposals will be around for a generation or more and will be remembered. It's about making sure they are fairer, cheaper, more secure, more reliable and potentially better for people.\"\n\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas accused the government of ignoring public opinion on the proposed fracking law and said ministers were\"steamrolling through legislation that will deny people any say in what happens to the very ground beneath their homes\". \n\nPlaid Cymru's leader at Westminster, Elfyn Llwyd, also expressed concern about the fracking plans, and added:\"This was an uninspired Queen's Speech delivered by a government that has well and truly run out of steam.\"\n\nThe SNP said the final Queen's Speech before Scotland votes on independence contained nothing to win over Scottish voters.\n\nUKIP's head of policy, MEP for the East of England Tim Aker, said the Queen's Speech contained no policies on issues the general public care about.\n\n\"The decision to only offer recall voting on a signed-off-by-Parliament-basis reflects a political class that does not know, does not trust and certainly does not represent its people. As far as I can tell, the contents of the Queen's Speech shows just why that democratic gulf is widening and UKIP are growing so rapidly in the polls,\"he added.\n\nIn addition to the 11 new bills there are six other ones - including one authorising the building of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands - being carried over from the last session. \n\nThere are also three draft bills, setting out legislation to improve compensation for people whose property has been damaged in riots, protect charities from abuse and improve the governance of national parks in England.\nTL;DR: David Cameron has hailed the Queen's Speech as \"a packed programme of a busy and radical government\" amid claims the coalition has run out of steam.\n\nArticle: Lawyers for the 22-year-old asked for an abortion on the grounds that her life was at risk, as she suffers from lupus and kidney failure. Her child is likely to die soon after birth.\n\nAbortions are prohibited in El Salvador under any circumstances.\n\nBut the health minister said the C-section was an acceptable intervention.\n\n\"It is very clear at this time that the pregnancy intervention is not an abortion, it is an induced birth, which is something else,\"Maria Rodriguez told a news conference.\n\nShe stressed that protecting the life of the pregnant woman - referred to as\"Beatriz\"- was the\"decisive factor\".\n\nSpeaking to AFP news agency, Beatriz said she was\"very nervous\"but wanted the Caesarean section to guarantee her own health.\n\n\"What they did to me was not right. They made me suffer by waiting all this time here in the hospital,\"she said speaking from the National Maternity Hospital in San Salvador.\n\nShe has had no contact from anyone in government with details of next week's surgery, she adds.\n\nA medical committee at her maternity hospital, the Ministry of Health and rights groups had all supported Beatriz's request to terminate her pregnancy, but judges at the Supreme Court voted four-to-one to reject the woman's appeal on Wednesday.\n\nIn their ruling, the judges said:\"This court determines that the rights of the mother cannot take precedence over those of the unborn child or vice versa, and that there is an absolute bar to authorising an abortion as contrary to the constitutional protection accorded to human persons'from the moment of conception'.\"\n\nThe judges said physical and psychological tests showed that Beatriz's illness was under control and she could continue with the pregnancy.\n\nOne of the judges, Judge Gonzalez, said he had not been convinced Beatriz was at risk of dying if the pregnancy was allowed to continue.\n\nHowever, tests show that Beatriz's 26-week-old foetus is developing without a complete brain, a condition called anencephaly. Almost all babies born with this condition die before or shortly after birth. \n\nThe case has drawn international attention to El Salvador's strict abortion laws, particularly from campaigners for the legalisation of abortion in cases where the mother's or foetus's life are at risk.\nTL;DR: A seriously ill woman who was denied an abortion by the Supreme Court of El Salvador says she will undergo a premature Caesarean section next week.\n\nArticle: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo got together to write to the prestigious prize's panel.\n\nThey said they wanted to make a\"collective statement\"at a time when there was\"already so much that divides and isolates people and communities\".\n\nThe judges agreed and revealed the move at Tuesday's ceremony in Margate, Kent.\n\nThe Turner Prize is Britain's most high-profile contemporary art award. The quartet will share the \u00a340,000 prize money.\n\nThe art world had gathered at the town's Dreamland amusement park to find out who had won, but even for an award once known for its shock value, the four-way split was unexpected.\n\nAttendees stood and cheered as Vogue magazine editor Edward Enninful opened the envelope and was surprised to find a statement about all four artists rather than the name of just one.\n\n\"Here's something quite extraordinary,\"he said.\"At a time of political division in Britain and conflict in much of the world, the artists wanted to use the occasion of the Turner Prize to make a strong statement of community and solidarity and have formed themselves into a collective.\"\n\nThis year's nominated works included Murillo's congregation of human effigies staring at a black curtain covering a window overlooking the sea; and\"audio investigator\"Abu Hamdan's sound effects, recreating the noise inside a notorious Syrian prison. They were the pre-ceremony favourites.\n\nShani presented a brightly-coloured feminist fantasy world\"beyond patriarchal limits\"; while Cammock made a film commemorating the role of women at the start of the Northern Irish Troubles in the late 1960s.\n\nIn their letter to the judges, the quartet said they all made art\"about social and political issues and contexts we believe are of great importance and urgency\".\n\nThey continued:\"The politics we deal with differ greatly, and for us it would feel problematic if they were pitted against each other, with the implication that one was more important, significant or more worthy of attention than the others.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Cammock read a joint statement saying their work was\"incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise\".\n\nThey said they wanted to speak out in\"an era marked by the rise of the right and the renewal of fascism in an era of the Conservatives' hostile environment that has paradoxically made each of us and many of our friends and family again increasingly unwelcome in Britain\".\n\nThey added:\"Isolation and exclusion are the weapons of this hostile environment. It is this we seek to stand against by making this symbolic gesture of cohesion.\"\n\nThe jury unanimously agreed to allow them to share the prize.\"We are honoured to be supporting this bold statement of solidarity and collaboration in these divided times,\"they said.\"Their symbolic act reflects the political and social poetics that we admire and value in their work.\"\n\nTate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the judges, said:\"In coming together and presenting themselves as a group, this year's nominated artists certainly gave the jury a lot to think about.\n\n\"But it is very much in the spirit of these artists' work to challenge convention, to resist polarised world views, and to champion other voices. The jury all felt that this made the collective a worthy winner of the Turner Prize.\"\n\n'The upset to end them all', or'virtue signalling'?\n\nReacting to the news of the shared prize, Adrian Searle in The Guardian wrote:\"'Good for them!' - subverting the Turner prize is what artists are meant to do\".\n\n\"Losers have sulked and even attacked people with gladioli. But the four shortlisted artists' decision to share this year's winnings could be the upset to end them all,\"said their writer Adrian Searle.\n\nThe Independent declared:\"The Turner Prize puts itself out of business by allowing the artists to award the prize to themselves.\"\n\n\"The four nominees asked to share this year's prize - but robbing the judges and the public of the opportunity to scrutinise and compare their work hurts the artists too,\"wrote Mark Hudson.\n\n\"Is the baffling Turner Prize 2019 result just a virtue signal for the snowflake era?\"asked Alastair Sooke in The Telegraph.\n\nOn Twitter, Jamie Byng, whose company Canongate published the Booker-winning best-seller Life of Pi, posted:\"What a beautiful and genuine act of solidarity.  I hope this inspires others to think and act similarly.\"\n\nWriter Musa Okwonga agreed, adding the\"only true opponents\"to artists are\"the blank canvas\".\n\nArt critic Andrew Russell was less enthusiastic about all four artists\"asking for a participation trophy!\", as he put it.\n\nNo winners or losers?\n\nAnalysis by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz\n\nThe decision to award the Turner Prize to all four nominees collectively was not made on the spur of the moment. The idea developed in the autumn when the artists first met in Margate for the Turner Prize exhibition opening. \n\nIt was discussed within the Tate (the ultimate overseer of the prize), led by Alex Farquharson. The proposal gave pause for thought, reservations were expressed, followed by the decision to put the artists' proposal to the Turner Prize jury. \n\nThe jury's decision to acquiesce to the artists' request sets a precedent which may well complicate matters for future juries, and possibly, the prize itself. \n\nThe fact is a lot of the artists who accept the invitation to take part in the Turner Prize (some refuse) do so with a nagging concern about its basic conceit: a competition to choose a winner, a best in class. Nominees can see it as a simplistic, reductive notion, which sits uncomfortably. In the past they've held their nose and got on with it. I wonder how many will in the future.\n\nMaybe annual awards like the Turner Prize and the Booker Prize, which also didn't have a single winner this year, are reaching their sell-by date: an anachronism from a bygone binary age of winners and losers.\n\nAlmost 95,000 people have visited an exhibition of the shortlisted works since it opened in September at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The exhibition runs until 12 January.\n\nThree years ago, Turner winner Helen Marten pledged to share the prize money with her fellow nominees - three weeks after doing the same with her winnings from the inaugural Hepworth Prize.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the Booker Prize was split between two winners - Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo - after the judges refused to select a single victor.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The current total for young people stands at 51.1%, and Emilio Papas is one of them.\n\nHe smiles as he admits that the irony of the situation has not escaped him: living in a former social security office when neither he nor any of the other squatters has ever made any national insurance payments.\n\nLast year Mr Papas and a group of his unemployed friends, aged between 18 and 32 years old, spent several months making the building habitable.\n\nEach of the squatters has his own flat and they are planning on using the ground floor as a community centre for the neighbourhood.\n\nThey have also opened their doors to an older resident, 60-year-old George Koutselas, who would otherwise have been left homeless.\n\n\"I worked most of my life but none of my bosses ever paid national insurance contributions for me, so now I don't get a pension or any benefits.\n\n\"As far as the Greek state is concerned I don't exist,\"says Mr Koutselas.\n\nUnemployment benefit in Greece is available only to people who have made national insurance contributions and since many young people have never had a job, they are not entitled to any financial support.\n\nEven those who do receive the monthly payments of 360 euros (\u00a3300) see them stop after one year.\n\nAfter that, unemployed people in Greece are on their own, without access to financial support or free healthcare.\n\nTalk of'revolution'\n\n27-year-old economics graduate Eleni Katsarea is unemployed and worried she might not have a job when her benefit runs out in a few months.\n\n\"I am trying not to think about it because I get too stressed,\"she says.\n\nThe first person in her family to go to university, she never imagined she would end up dependent on the state.\n\nBut today one in three graduates in Greece is without work and unemployment among postgraduates has doubled.\n\n\"I have a degree, I speak several languages and I have something to offer the country but they don't let me, there are no opportunities,\"says Ms Katsarea.\n\nWhen she is not looking for work Eleni Katsarea goes to the centre of town where there are demonstrations almost every day.\n\n\"I would like to see a public audit of this debt they are asking us to pay. Who got all the money? Because it wasn't us,\"she shouts over the noise of the protest.\n\nThe talk among her and her friends is of revolution.\n\nNick Maltoutzis, the deputy editor of the daily English language paper, Kathimerini, says that Greece has reached a dangerous point in terms of youth unemployment.\n\nHe says too many young people are locked into a situation without prospects, without jobs and without political parties that represent their views.\n\n\"There is clearly a lot of anger building up in the system and you cannot predict how the pressure is going to express itself - but you can be sure it will not be pleasant,\"he says.\n\nBrain-drain\n\nThe frustration with the lack of employment opportunities among the young is only exacerbated by the feeling that they have been abandoned by a state which offers them little support.\n\nLocal unemployment offices are shutting down as a result of cuts in public spending, and those that are open offer little or no advice on how to find a job.\n\nThe general secretary for the Ministry of Labour, Anna Stratinaki, admits that the ministry is battling to get to grips with plans for the total restructuring of the public sector.\n\n\"Young people need to show endurance, courage and solidarity so that we can overcome this difficult period together,\"she says.\n\nBut endurance, courage and solidarity do not pay the rent and so, for many over-educated and under-employed young people, the future is abroad.\n\nAlthough there are no statistics for the numbers leaving the country, research from 2010 suggests that nearly 85% of Greeks studying abroad were not planning to return.\n\nAt Athens International Airport 25-year-old Grigoris Panayotopoulos is checking in his baggage as he prepares to fly to Trieste in Italy where he has a job as an engineer lined up.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe 10 years from now I might decide to leave behind the job and return to Greece, but at the moment I am planning on going there forever.\"\n\nIt is not his fault, he says, that the Greek economy is in crisis, so why should he pay the price?\n\nAs he leaves, Grigoris Panayotopoulos takes with him his skills and education. The risk for Greece is that this brain-drain could leave the country without the very people needed to rebuild the economy.\n\n'Scars' of unemployment\n\nBut for many young people who do not have the means to leave, like Emilios Papas at the squat in the abandoned social security office, they are out on their own.\n\nHe estimates that at least 70 former government buildings around the city are being used as squats.\n\n\"People need to start doing things for themselves because the state only has its own best interests at heart,\"he says.\n\nIn reality there is little the Greek government can do about the lack of jobs, so long as its hands are tied by the promises it has made to cut the deficit in return for bailout funds.\n\nThere is evidence to show that people who are unemployed for a long time in their youth have less confidence and tend to achieve less in later life. Experts call this the\"unemployment scar\".\n\nSo could Greece be storing up a troubled generation for the future?\n\nNick Maltoutzis at the newspaper Kathimerini fears that could be the case.\n\n\"People in their 20s\u2026 will end up feeling useless and then it's very difficult to change the psychology,\"he says.\n\nChloe Hadjimatheou was reporting for the BBC World Service documentary programme, Assignment.

We want people to come along and rock the lock at the silent disco!\"\n\nGraham Smith, construction supervisor for the Canal and River Trust, said:\"Repairing all the lock gates at Camden (Hampstead Road Lock 1A and B, Hawley Lock and Kentish Town Lock) over the last few years has been challenging, but we're pleased with the work we've done and the gates shouldn't need replacing for a quarter of a century.\"\n\nA gun was discovered in the drained canal bed which police believe has been in the water since the 1980s.\n\nIt is not in working condition and has\"no forensic opportunities\".\nTL;DR: A celebration will be held in a drained chamber of Camden Lock to mark the end of three-years of repairs.\n\nArticle: The A14 corridor scheme includes a bypass around Huntingdon and new roads running parallel to the A14.\n\nThe plan aims to ease congestion on the main route from the port of Felixstowe, in Suffolk, to the M6.\n\nTolling could help to fund improvements to the\"crucial\"road, the DfT said.\n\nHowever, it has not yet been decided which section of the A14 could have a toll.\n\n'Congestion-blighted'\n\nSubject to agreement with local authorities on a funding package, and decisions at the next Spending Review, construction work could begin by 2018.\n\nIn December the government announced a\"participation exercise\"seeking long-term solutions to congestion issues on the road.\n\nThe A14 Challenge was managed by the DfT and Cambridgeshire County Council with input from councils in Northamptonshire and Suffolk.\n\nThe new plans include improvements along the route of the A14 from Milton through to the A1 junctions, two new untolled roads for local use and upgrades to the existing carriageway with the removal of accesses and junctions.\n\nImprovements to junctions at the northern and southern ends would also be carried out.\n\nA spokesman from the DfT said:\"Study work has confirmed that funding for these can be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring around 20 miles of new or widened road. \n\n\"However, more work will be taken to determine the best tolling solution, including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay and what the tariff should be.\"\n\nCambridgeshire County Council leader Nick Clarke described the announcement as\"fantastic news for the area\".\n\n\"It will unlock the improvements so desperately needed for this congestion-blighted road and help deliver major improvements to its poor safety record,\"he said.\n\nTransport Secretary Justine Greening said:\"The A14 is a crucial strategic route for the east of England, vital not only for international road traffic using the port of Felixstowe but everyone who relies on it daily.\"\nTL;DR: Drivers could have to pay to use a 20-mile (32km) section of the A14 in Cambridgeshire as part of a major highways investment planned by the Department for Transport (DfT).\n\nArticle: By Laura LockeTechnology reporter, San Francisco\n\nOthers called the Mac\"just a demo - not a real computer yet,\"Randy Wigginton, creator of the Mac's first word processor, tells the BBC. \n\n\"We didn't have all the software that the IBM PC had or even that the Apple II had,\"he says. \n\n\"It was slow. There were things that it didn't do well.\"\n\nBack then, programmers also thought it absurd the Mac designers had abandoned the typical alpha-numeric interface in favour of a friendlier graphical one and a point-and-click mouse, making it too easy for users, recalls Leander Kahney, editor of The Cult of Mac news website. \n\n\"They thought it trivialised their profession,\"he adds.\n\nThe original model's 128 kilobytes of RAM (random access memory) also limited its use.\n\nBut three decades later, Macs are still here and selling briskly.\n\nOver the weekend, more than 100 members of the original Mac team were reunited at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, where Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs had first introduced the computer on 24 January 1984, to commemorate its 30th anniversary. \n\nBelow, in their own words, are excerpts from the pioneering software and hardware developers' recollections of creating the all-in-one computer.\n\nHardware design\n\nThe developers were asked if they had felt defensive about other PC-makers laughing at them for selling a\"closed box\".\n\nJerry Manock (industrial design lead): \n\nSteve had an incredibly good answer to that. [When] the Apple II came out, third-party vendors could put boards in, you could use other monitors, etc.  \n\nWhenever there was a failure, or the customer had a problem, Apple Computer got the call.\n\nIt could have been [the fault of] any number of third party vendors. It could have been the monitor, the disk drive, whatever. \n\nSo, Steve made the decision: if we supply the display and the boards [and] everything is sealed up inside the box and it works when it leaves the factory, then we're willing to take the responsibility of answering the service calls. \n\nBill Atkinson (developer of MacPaint & MacDraw):\n\nWe were trying to make something that was user-friendly and that meant someone could walk up to it and figure out how to use it without using a manual.\n\nJerry Manock: \n\nJef Raskin's [original Mac project leader] idea was portability. \n\nWhen Steve took the Mac project over, he had a vision that this computer was going to be sitting on a worker's desk.\n\nHe wanted it to [take] minimal space on the desk, so that was a pretty radical change.\n\nGeorge Crow (analogue circuit board engineer):\n\nWe knew if [Steve] just ground you down a few days you'd come up with an even better idea a few days later.\n\nBill Atkinson: \n\nSteve wasn't really an engineer but he knew how to get the best out of people.\n\nOne time Larry Kenyon was working on the operating system, and Steve said:'We need to make this thing faster, it's taking too long to start up. Now Larry, if it would save someone's life, could you make it 10 seconds faster?'\n\nLarry said:\"Yeah, probably I could.\"\n\nTwo days later, it was 30 seconds faster.\n\nThe team were asked what it was like having Microsoft write some of the application software, knowing that co-founder Bill Gates later remarked he had more people working on the original Mac's software than Apple did.\n\nRandy Wittington (MacWrite developer):\n\nIf they had more people than us it doesn't speak very highly of the quality of the piece that they had. \n\nAndy Hertzfeld (Mac operating system developer): \n\nMicrosoft wasn't what they became at that time. They were a small private company. Apple probably had 20 times the revenues of Microsoft when they started, but they were our close collaborators. \n\nThey were the first company we gave a Mac to. They really helped us.\n\nWe didn't have enough applications. We really only had MacPaint and MacWrite, [and] they were working on three applications.\n\nThe Mac's early development team envisioned selling the personal computer for $1,000 (\u00a3605), but later, after the cost of essential parts like Motorola's 68000 microprocessor were factored in, the price bumped upwards. \n\nAndy Hertzfeld: \n\n$1,495 that was our price for years and years and years.\n\nThen... John Sculley [Apple's chief executive at the time] convinced us we have to charge $2,495 to pay for a big marketing campaign. That kind of broke my heart because that really is the difference of a kid being able to get their hands on one or not.\n\nCaroline Rose (Documentation developer):\n\nI remember the meeting where that price was announced. It was such sad day... We were all just really depressed.\n\nAndy Hertzfeld:\n\nBecause we all thought we were making something for ourselves and the people we cared about. And that price, once it got up above $2,000, it could no longer be that.\n\nBill Atkinson:\n\nIt wasn't work. We were making art. Steve insisted that we sign our names on a piece of paper with a Sharpie [pen] and he engraved it on to the mould [inside of the case of the first production run] so all of our signatures would be on it. And the reason is: real artists sign their work and they're proud of it.  \n\nRod Holt (co-developer Mac Finder):\n\nThis process of invention is very unusual... we were more than willing workers. \n\nThe peculiar thing was that [Jobs] didn't understand somebody would work day and night on a computer or any other project and not do it out of love.\n\nBut, see, we weren't doing it for money. I don't think anybody would have quit if Steve had come and said:\"You guys don't get paid.\"\n\nI think we would have still had a group and we still would have been working.\nTL;DR: It's hard to imagine nowadays, but when Apple introduced the Macintosh personal computer in 1984 it was widely dismissed as a \"toy\".\n\nArticle: By Thomas MackintoshBBC News, London\n\nUnder the new \u00a31.4bn project, up to 967 new homes will be built - as it stands only 20% will be affordable.\n\nIt falls short of Sadiq Khan's pledge for 35% for developments on public land, though he accepts it is a\"starting point.\"\n\nA charity has urged him to\"claw back\"as much affordable housing as possible.\n\nMr Khan expects the amount of affordable housing in the Croydon project\"to rise over time\", something which Brian Robson, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, backs.\n\nMr Robson said:\"I'm sure there are reasons as to why the deal was struck this way, but the mayor has been really strong in getting developers to stick to these affordable housing targets since coming into office.\"\n\nSince his 2016 election win, the Mayor of London, has used\"planning powers\"to intervene in four separate developments across London and raise the amount of affordable homes in each of those schemes to his required 35%.\n\nMr Khan and his team can assert influence on large proposals to make sure plans meet three\"policy tests\".\n\nThese include a project having a significant impact on more than one London borough, the London Plan and for\"sound planning reasons for intervention\".\n\nIn October, Mr Khan scrutinised plans to build 348 homes on the site of a Wandsworth Homebase store on Swandon Way as it emerged that only 23% of those homes would be cheaper.\n\nHe said he used his\"full range of planning powers\"to bring the level of lower-priced housing to his required minimum of 35%.\n\nSince becoming mayor, Mr Khan has intervened with three other developments - in Wealdstone, Tottenham Hale and Mill Hill - in order to raise the amount of affordable housing in. \n\nAlthough the Westfield project was referred to the mayor, rather than\"called in\", Mr Robson has urged Mr Khan to take a similar approach with the Croydon development - which will see the existing Whitgift Centre, on private land, be demolished.\n\nHe said:\"We are in a housing crisis at the moment. \n\n\"It is vitally important he continues to squeeze as much affordable housing out of the developer.\"\n\nSpeaking about public land, James Murray, deputy mayor for housing, said:\"People in London rightly expect there to be a high level of affordable housing given the land is in public ownership.\n\n\"Yet it is sold off to the highest bidder for a one-off land receipt and the homes built are affordable to very few people.\"\n\nCity Hall said, in terms of the Westfield project, the mayor\"accepted a starting point of 20% affordable housing to get this major regeneration scheme for Croydon under way as soon as possible\".\nTL;DR: Croydon could miss out on 145 new affordable homes as part of recently approved plans to build a huge shopping centre in south London.\n\nArticle: Justin Lin will direct what will be the 10th and 11th films in the series, Deadline and Variety said.\n\nThe ninth film in the franchise will be released in May 2021, having been put back a year by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe action-packed film series began in 2001 with The Fast and the Furious, starring Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and the late Paul Walker.\n\nThe franchise has since expanded to incorporate eight direct sequels, one movie spin-off and an animated TV series.\n\nThe series - which includes last year's Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw - has so far generated $5.7bn (\u00a34.3bn) worldwide.\n\nFurious 7, released in 2015, is the most successful instalment to date, having made $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn).\n\nAccording to Deadline, the final two films are likely to tell\"a big story\"that will reunite all the series' core cast members. Distributor Universal has been approached for comment.\n\nHow franchise became vast and victorious\n\nWhen The Fast and the Furious was released in 2001, few predicted it would spawn a global box office behemoth.\n\nModest in scale and named after a 1954 B-movie, its story of an undercover cop who infiltrates a group of vehicle-hijacking street racers was a hit with audiences, but was met with critical derision.\n\n\"The Fast and the Furious... scarcely lives up to its title,\"sneered Entertainment Weekly, while The Washington Post dubbed it\"Rebel Without a Cause without a cause\".\n\nThe BBC's Neil Smith, though, gave a warm welcome to\"a visceral, high-octane, Formula One of a flick\"that was\"the best movie of the summer\".\n\nWalker returned, minus Diesel, in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which saw him and new co-star Tyrese Gibson fall foul of a Miami drug lord under the late John Singleton's direction.\n\nThat was followed in 2006 by The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, which saw a new character - Lucas Black's Sean Boswell - become involved in illegal street racing in Japan.\n\nIt was 2009's Fast & Furious, however, that set the template for the series' subsequent development as a globetrotting action franchise in the James Bond mould.\n\nThe film saw Brian O'Conner (Walker) and Dominic Toretto (Diesel) reunite and join forces to bring down a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nFast Five (2011) took the formula to Rio and introduced Dwayne\"The Rock\"Johnson as Luke Hobbs, a US enforcement agent intent on bringing Toretto to justice.\n\nIn 2013, Fast & Furious 6 took the team to London before climaxing with an explosive showdown involving a cargo plane attempting to take off. The BBC subsequently calculated that a runway would need to be 18.37 miles (29.6km) long for the 13-minute sequence to be achieved in reality.\n\nFast & Furious 7 followed in 2015, although its release was overshadowed by Walker's tragic death in a car accident in December 2013.\n\nThe film was the usual mix of outrageous stunts and exotic locations, but ended with a poignant coda that served as a tribute to the departed actor.\n\n2017's F8, aka The Fate of the Furious, introduced Charlize Theron as a new adversary and saw nuclear submarines join the series' collection of high-performance vehicles.\n\n2019's Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw, meanwhile, saw Johnson's character form a testy alliance with reformed criminal Deckard Shaw, played by Jason Statham.\n\nOver the years, the Fast & Furious ensemble has expanded to incorporate such actors as Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot, rapper Ludacris and Dame Helen Mirren.\n\nThe series has also spawned the Netflix animated series Fast & Furious Spy Racers as well as video games, live shows and theme park attractions.\n\nFast & Furious 9, aka F9, had been due for release in April but was put back by 11 months due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe film, which was shot in London and Edinburgh as well as Georgia and Thailand, is now scheduled for release in May 2021.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The ICO said it expected to see improvements in their operations in the coming months.\n\nThree more companies, which have not been named, are being investigated by the ICO.\n\nSpeaking to Radio 4's You & Yours, Simon Entwistle, the director of operations at the ICO, said that while companies often maintained that they had permission to contact customers directly, separate consent must exist for marketing calls.\n\nHe added that there was no action they could take about calls which were made to chase a debt.\n\n\"We start off by working with the organisations because some of these big companies like British Gas and Talk Talk want to get this right but clearly there are problems,\"he said. \n\n\"We talk to them about how they can get it right and where we see in their system that something is going wrong.\n\n\"There is another category of organisation that only pay lip service to the regulations, what they want to do is to make as many calls as possible and try and get away with it. \n\n\"With those we take a very different approach, we have not named those organisations because we are actively gathering evidence in order to fine them for flouting the regulations as opposed to working and helping people who actually want to get it right.\"\n\nHighest standards\n\nA spokesman for British Gas said:\"We uphold the highest standards when contacting people in their homes, and only use contact information if we have express permission to do so.\"\n\nScottish Power said it was working with the ICO. Talk Talk said complaints had fallen, it was not facing enforcement action and was working with the ICO.\n\nWe Fight Any Claim said its data was provided by an external company and if numbers listed on the Telephone Preference Service slipped through they were immediately blocked. \n\nAnglian Windows said it took complaints seriously.\n\nWeatherseal Home Improvements confirmed it had been contacted by the ICO and was co-operating.\n\nThe BBC contacted The Claims Guys but has yet to receive a response.\nTL;DR: The Information Commissioner's Office has named firms it has concerns over regarding unsolicited marketing calls.\n\nArticle: By Chris QuevatreBBC News Online\n\nThese computer experts have swapped the confines of their bedrooms for a fairly ordinary looking cyber-security company in Plymouth.\n\nBluescreen employs hackers the authorities have deemed worthy of a second chance, who pit their wits against some of the anonymous online criminals they used to see as brothers in arms.\n\nWhen Jack was 19 years old, the police sent five squad cars, a tech team and a riot van to his home.\n\n\"It was about 08:10 in the morning. I'd had the most awful night's sleep and I'd just started watching The Lion King.\n\n\"It didn't even get past the intro before my bedroom door flew open and 10 police officers came in to arrest me.\n\n\"I was not expecting that on any day of my life.\"\n\nThe police were there for a good reason: when he was 16, Jack had stolen personal information from about 1,000 people.\n\nHe told police he'd never had any intention of using it for his own gain; to him, it was just an intellectual exercise.\n\nStories like this are not uncommon at Bluescreen IT, which has a direct link with the police to find hackers in need of direction.\n\nThese are young men who have been accused of serious crimes, but instead of being taken through the criminal justice system, they've been given a second chance.\n\nAbout 15 people work in the Security Operations Centre, a handful of whom have been referred to the company as hackers who aren't malicious in nature and are deemed capable of reform.\n\nAnother employee, Cameron, was arrested on his way to school when he was just 14 years old.\n\nOfficers from the National Crime Agency had planned the sting so that Cameron would be out of the house, and unable to destroy his hard drives in the event he heard them coming.\n\n\"Up to that point my biggest worry was that I hadn't done my maths homework,\"he said.\n\n\"I was walking to school when I heard my name being called. I turned round and there was a man in a suit walking behind me.\n\n\"Then I heard him say my name louder, so I turned around and said'yeah?' and that's when he told me I was under arrest.\n\n\"I turned around and there were five more officers spread out across the grass.\n\n\"I just didn't realise that what I'd done was that serious. It was all just one big joke - messing around - it never seemed like I was actually causing any real harm. I soon found out how serious it was.\"\n\n\"Grey hat hackers\"like Jack and Cameron are seen as having committed their crimes for reasons that weren't to do with personal gain or cyber-terrorism. Sometimes it might have been a practical joke, or perhaps the motive was to launch a server-debilitating attack.\n\nNow they try to stop others - using the methods they once employed - from wreaking the same havoc.\n\nHackers' hats\n\nWhite hat hackers - These are the nice guys of the hacking world. They know what they're doing and they use their talents for good, such as getting rid of viruses or legitimately testing the security systems of companies and governments.\n\nBlack hat hackers - The bad guys. They're the ones who steal your bank details and sell them on the dark web. They usually hack for personal gain, although it could be some form of cyber-espionage or protest.\n\nGrey hat hackers - Somewhere in between. They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them. What they're doing is still illegal.\n\nThe route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.\n\nWhen he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked.\n\n\"I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them.\"\n\nHe started making\"mods\"to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet.\n\n\"I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency,\"Cameron said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nFor Jack, now 23, it was his\"laziness\"that led him into the world of computing.\n\n\"I was 12. We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it. \n\n\"I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra. It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things.\n\n\"I was trying to cut corners any way I could. Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well. \n\n\"I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute.

            "test_query": "By Chris QuevatreBBC News Online\n\nThese computer experts have swapped the confines of their bedrooms for a fairly ordinary looking cyber-security company in Plymouth.\n\nBluescreen employs hackers the authorities have deemed worthy of a second chance, who pit their wits against some of the anonymous online criminals they used to see as brothers in arms.\n\nWhen Jack was 19 years old, the police sent five squad cars, a tech team and a riot van to his home.\n\n\"It was about 08:10 in the morning. I'd had the most awful night's sleep and I'd just started watching The Lion King.\n\n\"It didn't even get past the intro before my bedroom door flew open and 10 police officers came in to arrest me.\n\n\"I was not expecting that on any day of my life.\"\n\nThe police were there for a good reason: when he was 16, Jack had stolen personal information from about 1,000 people.\n\nHe told police he'd never had any intention of using it for his own gain; to him, it was just an intellectual exercise.\n\nStories like this are not uncommon at Bluescreen IT, which has a direct link with the police to find hackers in need of direction.\n\nThese are young men who have been accused of serious crimes, but instead of being taken through the criminal justice system, they've been given a second chance.\n\nAbout 15 people work in the Security Operations Centre, a handful of whom have been referred to the company as hackers who aren't malicious in nature and are deemed capable of reform.\n\nAnother employee, Cameron, was arrested on his way to school when he was just 14 years old.\n\nOfficers from the National Crime Agency had planned the sting so that Cameron would be out of the house, and unable to destroy his hard drives in the event he heard them coming.\n\n\"Up to that point my biggest worry was that I hadn't done my maths homework,\"he said.\n\n\"I was walking to school when I heard my name being called. I turned round and there was a man in a suit walking behind me.\n\n\"Then I heard him say my name louder, so I turned around and said'yeah?' and that's when he told me I was under arrest.\n\n\"I turned around and there were five more officers spread out across the grass.\n\n\"I just didn't realise that what I'd done was that serious. It was all just one big joke - messing around - it never seemed like I was actually causing any real harm. I soon found out how serious it was.\"\n\n\"Grey hat hackers\"like Jack and Cameron are seen as having committed their crimes for reasons that weren't to do with personal gain or cyber-terrorism. Sometimes it might have been a practical joke, or perhaps the motive was to launch a server-debilitating attack.\n\nNow they try to stop others - using the methods they once employed - from wreaking the same havoc.\n\nHackers' hats\n\nWhite hat hackers - These are the nice guys of the hacking world. They know what they're doing and they use their talents for good, such as getting rid of viruses or legitimately testing the security systems of companies and governments.\n\nBlack hat hackers - The bad guys. They're the ones who steal your bank details and sell them on the dark web. They usually hack for personal gain, although it could be some form of cyber-espionage or protest.\n\nGrey hat hackers - Somewhere in between. They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them. What they're doing is still illegal.\n\nThe route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.\n\nWhen he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked.\n\n\"I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them.\"\n\nHe started making\"mods\"to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet.\n\n\"I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency,\"Cameron said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nFor Jack, now 23, it was his\"laziness\"that led him into the world of computing.\n\n\"I was 12. We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it. \n\n\"I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra. It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things.\n\n\"I was trying to cut corners any way I could. Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well. \n\n\"I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute.

The ONS said the total number was 7.99 million between January and March, up 118,000 compared with the previous three month period between October and December.  \n\nThose working part-time because they couldn't find a full-time job was also the highest since records began in 1992 at 1.42 million, up 73,000 on the previous quarter. \n\nOf the 45,000 drop in unemployment, 42,000 were men and just 3,000 were women. \n\n\"It's still women and young people who are bearing the brunt of the recession,\"said the Unison union general secretary Dave Prentis.\n\n'International uncertainty'\n\nEmployment Minister Chris Grayling said overall the figures were a\"welcome step in the right direction\".\n\n\"For a number of months now, employment has been growing and this is starting to feed through into improving unemployment figures.\n\n\"However, we still face significant international uncertainty so we need to hold firm on our current economic strategy and continue to do everything we can to ensure unemployment continues to fall.\"\n\nBank of England governor Sir Mervyn King also said that the latest figures were consistent with a gradual recovery in the UK economy, while pointing to the huge risk to the UK economy posed by the crisis in the eurozone, the UK's biggest trading partner.  \n\nShadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said it was\"really worrying to see the soaring long term costs as the number of long term unemployed surges towards the 1 million mark - the highest since the Tories were in Government last time\". \n\n\"That's why it was so complacent for the government to give us a budget that failed to deliver on jobs. People in Britain are fighting through and this government is failing to lift a finger to help,\"he added.  \n\n'Salary sacrifices'\n\nThere was also further evidence in the ONS data of the squeeze on household incomes. \n\nAverage pay including bonuses rose by 0.6% from a year earlier, the lowest growth for three years.  \n\nTUC general secretary Brendan Barber said:\"Today's figures are mixed, with the welcome fall in unemployment driven entirely by part-time jobs. \n\n\"However the collapse in wages is terrible news for those in work and threatens our chances of an economic recovery.\n\n\"The falling number of full-time jobs and the 6% fall in real wages over the last two years means that people are having to make huge salary sacrifices and put their careers on hold just to stay in work,\"he said.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which monitors the labour market, said the fall in joblessness was\"remarkable\"as the UK economy had just fallen back into recession. \n\n\"However, while optimists might conclude that this casts doubt on the reliability of the most recent official GDP growth figures, a more sober assessment is that a very weak economy is managing to keep unemployment in check only by maintaining a severe squeeze on the size of pay packets and creating enough low productivity work to allow people to avoid the dole by doing the odd part-time job here and there,\"said John Philpott, chief economic adviser at the CIPD.\nTL;DR: UK unemployment fell by 45,000 to 2.63 million in the first three months of the year, official figures have shown.\n\nArticle: Nathan Gill conceded there was\"turmoil\"within the Welsh party as he addressed the conference in Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\nHe was given Assembly leader Neil Hamilton's slot in a late change to the programme after Diane James was elected as the new leader.\n\nMr Hamilton described his speech as a\"backwards ramble down memory lane.\"\n\nIt is understood Mrs James, who was elected as party leader on Friday replacing Nigel Farage, sanctioned the change in conference agenda.\n\nMr Gill, who sits as a UKIP MEP and an independent AM in the Senedd, is one of her key supporters in the party.\n\nHe told BBC Wales he thought the move was a clear message that everyone needed to get behind Mrs James.\n\nMr Gill, who was appointed as leader in Wales by Mr Farage, said Mr Hamilton obviously felt\"slighted\"but that was not helping the party.\n\nHe said he thought a few people would now be questioning their positions within the party and that if people disagreed with the direction Mrs James was taking the party, they could leave.\n\nA rift emerged between the two men when Mr Hamilton was chosen by a majority of UKIP's seven AMs to lead them in the Senedd following the election in May.\n\nMr Hamilton described the MEP's speech as a\"lost opportunity\".\n\nHe said he would have used his spot to show what the Assembly group were doing to\"put UKIP on the map in Wales\". \n\nFollowing the election of Mrs James as party leader, Mr Hamilton said he hoped her leadership would mean an end to factionalism within the party.\n\nMr Hamilton said he would support Mrs James, despite having voted for runner-up Lisa Duffy.\nTL;DR: UKIP members must unite behind their new UK leader or the party will fail, the party's leader in Wales has said.\n\nArticle: Third Energy submitted a planning application to frack at a site near the village of Kirby Misperton in Ryedale in May.\n\nNorth Yorkshire County Council said it had requested further information from the company, which prompted the new 21-day consultation. \n\nA spokesperson said it had not set a date yet for a decision on the plans.\n\nA decision was expected on 18 November after the initial consultation on the shale gas application at the KM8 well site ended last month.\n\nBut this has now been delayed after the company submitted\"further information under environmental impact assessment regulations\", the council said.\n\nIn a statement, the authority said:\"These regulations require that as planning authority we advertise, consult and make the new information available for comment for not less than 21 days.

Police say she had died by the time they were able to intervene. \n\nMs Parveen's husband Muhammad Iqbal has maintained that officers stood by as the attack took place.\n\nMeanwhile, Iqbal himself has admitted killing his first wife six years ago in order to marry Ms Parveen.\n\nRelatives in'scuffle'\n\nMs Parveen, who was three months pregnant, was pelted with bricks and bludgeoned by relatives furious because she married against their wishes.\n\nIn a report given to the chief minister of Punjab state on Friday, police say one of Ms Parveen's relatives accosted her\"several hundred feet\"from the court premises and shot her in the shin.\n\nThere was no police deployment in that area, the report says, but a police inspector happened to be nearby and managed to snatch away the gun.\n\nHowever, according the police, a scuffle ensued between about 20 members of Ms Parveen's family and 10 to 15 of Iqbal's, during which one of Ms Parveen's brothers struck her with a brick three times, wounding her fatally.\n\nPolice say one of Ms Parveen's uncles, two of her cousins, and the driver who brought them to Lahore were arrested on Friday.\n\nHer father surrendered to police shortly after the killing. \n\n'Honour' killings in Pakistan\n\n\u2022In 2013, 869 women murdered in so called\"honour killings\"\n\n\u2022Campaigners say real number is likely to be much higher\n\n\u2022Of these, 359 were so called\"Karo Kari\"cases, whereby  family members consider themselves  authorised to kill offending relatives to restore honour\n\n\u2022Rights groups say conviction rate in cases of  sexual and other violence against women is\"critically low\"\n\nSource: Human Rights Commission of Pakistan annual report 2013 \n\nFurther reading: Why do families kill their daughters?\n\nMs Parveen's relatives had filed a case against Iqbal at the High Court, accusing him of abducting her.\n\nThe newlyweds were at the Lahore court to contest this case. Ms Parveen had already testified to police that she had married of her own free will.\n\nAnalysis - M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad \n\nThe twists and turns in the events since Farzana Perveen's murder on Tuesday have transformed a case of honour killing into a tricky tale of love, greed and murder.\n\nWe have a man who now admits to have killed an earlier wife, and a woman who the police claim was already someone else's legally wedded wife - which would make her an adulteress under Pakistani law. In addition, the father, brothers and cousins who are accused of murdering Farzana are also said to have killed a woman of the family before.\n\nA recent police report does little to explain this, except for its emphasis on the point that the Farzana case was not a case of stoning, suggesting that it did not merit the attention it got. This is reflective of a deeply conservative society which tends to condone such crimes, and is helped by a set of Islamic laws dating from the 1980s that\"privatise\"murder as a crime against the individual instead of the state, and give the heirs of the victim the right to pardon the killer.\n\nSo there is often minimum police interest in these cases, and as a result, there are few successful prosecutions. Many believe it is this atmosphere of impunity that emboldened Farzana's relatives in the first place to kill her in broad daylight. \n\nPrevious murder forgiven\n\nIn other developments in the case, Iqbal himself has admitted that he killed his first wife six years ago in order to be able to marry Ms Parveen.\n\nIqbal's son by his first marriage Aurangzeb told the BBC's Ilyas Khan that relatives persuaded him to forgive Iqbal, enabling his release from prison under Pakistani law.\n\n\"They said that my mother was gone anyway and would never return, and that I had two younger brothers to take care of,\"Aurangzeb said.\n\n\"So if my father came back, our life would be much better. And he was my father after all. So I agreed,\"he added.\n\nAurangzeb also said Ms Parveen had told him that her elder sister had also been killed by the family. In that case the sister had reportedly refused to leave her husband.\n\nA police spokesman told the BBC they could not confirm this allegation. There has been no comment from Ms Parveen's family.\n\nThere are hundreds of so-called\"honour killings\"in Pakistan each year. \n\nThe latest incident has prompted particular outrage, with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif describing it as\"totally unacceptable\". \n\nArranged marriages are the norm in Pakistan, and to marry against the wishes of the family is unthinkable in many deeply conservative communities.\nTL;DR: Pakistani police have denied they did nothing to stop a so-called honour killing in front of a court in Lahore.\n\nArticle: Mr Salmond said the programme would include guests from the worlds of politics, business and entertainment.\n\nIt will be produced by Mr Salmond's own Slainte Media company, which he set up with former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh.  \n\nRT has been described as a Russian propaganda channel, but Mr Salmond urged viewers to judge for themselves. \n\nOn Thursday, RT - formerly known as Russia Today - confirmed it would be registering with authorities in the US as an\"agent of the Russian state\"- a description disputed by the broadcaster, which insists it has editorial independence.\n\nUS intelligence agencies\n\nAn assessment by US intelligence agencies in January stated that:\"The Kremlin staffs RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, recruiting people who can convey Russian strategic messaging because of their ideological beliefs.''\n\nBut speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Salmond said:\"Over the last year or two, 50 Labour MPs - including the current Labour Party leader - 37 Conservative MPs and 17 SNP MPs have appeared on RT programmes. \n\n\"It would be a bit strange if I said, now that I'm no longer a member of parliament, that I'm refusing to make my own show with my own production company over which I have total editorial control, which is broadcast on RT.\"\n\nThe former SNP leader added:\"It would be a great idea if people watched the show, and if it is a good show and it has high production values and has interesting guests with interesting things to say then they should say it is a good show.\n\n\"And if it turns out to be Kremlin propaganda then people can slate me, but why don't they watch the show first?\"\n\nThe TV show, which will be broadcast in the UK every Thursday from 16 November, has been inspired by Mr Salmond's recent Edinburgh Festival Fringe show, Alex Salmond Unleashed.\n\nMr Salmond, who lost his Gordon seat to the Tories in June's general election, also hosts a radio show on the London-based LBC station, and has been linked to a potential takeover of the Johnston Press group, which includes the Scotsman and the i newspapers.\n\nSpeaking a launch event in London, he said he wanted to hear from\"people of ideas and answers\"on his TV programme, and would give guests a platform to explain their ideas before facing questions.\n\nThe former first minister said:\"This programme will give people with something to say a platform to say it, and we intend to find out something about the personalities behind the public figures.\n\n\"In this show I'm going to give you the opportunity to get to know our guests just that bit better.\"\n\nWhat has been the reaction?\n\nA spokesman for the SNP said it was\"entirely a matter for Alex Salmond\", and that he is free to take on any opportunities he wanted now he is no longer an elected politician.\n\nThe spokesman said the SNP has\"regularly expressed concern over actions by the Russian government, including reports of persecution on the grounds of race and sexuality, attacks on journalists and concerns about the integrity of the democratic process, and we will continue to pursue these concerns.\"\n\nSNP MP Douglas Chapman tweeted at BBC presenter Andrew Neil that Mr Salmond had\"probably got fed up waiting for an offer from the UK propaganda machine...you know, the one you work for.\"\n\nBut political opponents have criticised Mr Salmond, with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson tweeting:\"It's not often I feel sorry for Nicola Sturgeon, but Salmond taking the Kremlin's rouble on Russia Today? Ooft....\"\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the former first minister\"fancies himself as the Michael Parkinson of Vladimir Putin's propaganda channel\".\n\nThe Lib Dems have challenged Mr Salmond to interview opponents of Mr Putin, such as punk band Pussy Riot or Marina Litvinenko, the widow of murdered spy and dissident Alexander Litvinenko.\n\nScottish Labour leadership candidate Anas Sarwar said the move demonstrated an\"astonishing lack of judgement\"by Mr Salmond, and called on Ms Sturgeon to\"condemn this shameful decision\".\n\nAnd LBC presenter Iain Dale tweeted:\"I try my best not to slag off @LBC colleagues but I'm going to make an exception. \n\n\"I accepted an invite to the launch of @AlexSalmond's new TV show. Just found out it's for RT. Be ashamed, Alex.

Auction house Bonhams said buyers should be wary of buying artwork which had not been authenticated. \n\nOrganiser Sincura Group said it\"sensitively salvages\"artwork. \n\nDirector Tony Baxter said the company had not gained financially from any sales of Banksy's street work, and that it did not\"steal or condone any acts of vandalism or theft\". \n\nThe practice has attracted critics, with protests being held against the removal and auction of a Slave Labour mural which was on the side of a Poundland store in Wood Green, north London. \n\nIn a statement, Mr Baxter said:\"The Sincura Group are approached by building owners to remove the artwork illegally painted on their sites. \n\n\"The building owners have not asked for the art to be placed on their premises or for the on-going attention received from it. \n\n\"What is more, they run the very real risk of having a grade 2 listing applied to their premises which seriously affects their business operations and resale value. Though loved by the public these are often a hindrance to the building owners.\"\n\nOn his website, Banksy said:\"The Stealing Banksy exhibition in London has been organised without the involvement of consent of the artist... this show has got nothing to do with me and I think it's disgusting people are allowed to go around displaying art on walls without getting permission.\"\n\nRalph Taylor, the director of the UK board of contemporary art at Bonhams, said Sincura was trying to establish a market in selling Banksys and to do that, this exhibition had the aim of generating credibility.\n\n\"None of the art work has been authenticated so whether they are sellable is a moot point,\"he said.\n\nIn 2008, Banksy set up Pest Control to verify his artworks, however it only authenticates canvases and prints created by the artist, not his street works. \n\n\"People need to know what they are buying,\"said Mr Taylor, adding:\"Bonhams and other auction houses would not entertain the selling of an artwork which doesn't have a certificate of authenticity. \n\n\"Street artworks are easy to replicate as people could just download a stencil. Without the signature flourishes of an artist's paint brush it is harder to verify. It just seems to me to be a bit of a brick wall.\n\n\"It is up to the living artist to say what is legitimate or not.\"\n\nThe artworks are on display at Me London on the Strand until Sunday. Entry costs \u00a317.50.\n\nThe Sincura Group said an auction using online and sealed bids would conclude on Sunday. \n\nIn February, the mural Kissing Coppers fetched $575,000 (\u00a3345,000) at a US auction after being removed from the wall of a Brighton pub.\nTL;DR: A collection of street art by Banksy, removed from walls, has gone on display at a London hotel before the works are sold at auction.\n\nArticle: The online survey into the proposals for Union Terrace Gardens (UTG) was launched a week ago.\n\nLDA Design said the aim - including new access from surrounding streets - was to make UTG a\"lively cultural hub\".\n\nThe consultation closes at the end of Friday.\n\nA report on the consultation is expected to go to full council in March next year.

the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - and were intended to end World War Two.\n\nRoyal Mail had revealed a preview of its 2019 Special Stamp programme, showcasing the\"Best of British\"on Thursday.  \n\nOthers depicted a red kite to celebrate the UK's birds of prey and commemorated the bicentenary of the birth of Queen Victoria. \n\nThe 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings  was to be marked by a set of 11 stamps, in what the Royal Mail called\"a timely commemoration of all those who participated\"using\"images from the day itself\".\n\nPaul Woodadge, 49, a D-Day historian and former tour guide living in Normandy, who is originally from Essex, said:\"It's quite shocking really.\"\n\nSpeaking before Royal Mail announced it was withdrawing the stamp, he said:\"It's going to be the 75th anniversary of D-Day - the last one where there's any veterans around who will remember it.\n\n\"These stamps are the kind of thing people will buy for their fathers and grandfathers.\"\n\nA Twitter account for World War Two tours of Jersey tweeted Royal Mail to point out that the featured ship, LCI-30, did not participate in the Normandy landings. \n\nWriting on Facebook, Peter Simpson said the stamp was\"offensive and disrespectful of those that lost their lives on D-Day\". \n\nLate on Thursday, a Royal Mail spokeswoman said:\"We work very hard to ensure that our Special Stamp programme appropriately commemorates anniversaries and events that are relevant to UK heritage and life. \n\n\"We would like to offer our sincere apologies that our preview release for our 2019 Special Stamp programme included a stamp design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings. \n\n\"We can confirm that this image will not be part of the final set, which will be issued in June 2019.\"\nTL;DR: Royal Mail has withdrawn a stamp design marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day - after BBC News pointed out it showed US troops landing in what was Dutch New Guinea, nearly 8,500 miles from France.\n\nArticle: The royal couple travelled on a 1960s Routemaster bus to High Street Kensington station where they were met by military personnel and volunteers.\n\nThe event was part of London Poppy Day, which aims to raise over \u00a31m in a day for the Royal British Legion appeal.  \n\nMore than 2,000 volunteers are taking part in events for the legion before Remembrance Sunday.\n\nEarlier William and Kate travelled on the bus from Kensington Palace with legion supporters including actress Barbara Windsor and the newsreader Alastair Stewart.\n\nThe couple were also introduced to The Poppy Girls, who have produced the appeal's official single. \n\nLondon Poppy Day was launched by the group, who performed their song at Covent Garden, where a stage has been created for performances throughout the day.\n\nAt the station the duke and duchess spoke to retired volunteer Tim Connolly, who has been selling poppies at West Kensington station for nearly 40 years.\n\n\"They asked how the appeal was going and whether we were getting support from the public,\"he said.\n\n\"The public is responding when they see uniformed personnel out collecting for the appeal.\"\n\nFund-raisers are at 80 stations across London's transport network and different locations in the capital. \n\nPrime Minister David Cameron took part in the event by welcoming the bus to Downing Street, while the Band of The Royal Logistic Corps performed at Leadenhall Market.\n\nAll the funds raised will go towards the national Poppy Appeal's target of \u00a337m, which will help the legion carry out its work.\n\nIn central London, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Harry opened the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey.\n\nPrince Philip and Prince Harry met veterans and members of the legion as they were shown 100,000 crosses that have been planted in memory of fallen soldiers.\n\nThe duke opens the field of remembrance each year but this was the first time his grandson had joined him. \n\nThe field opens for 11 days each year and allows people to plant remembrance crosses. Remembrance Sunday takes place on 10 November.\n\nLater in the day Prince William also visited the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, west London, where he praised the work of two surgical teams. \n\nThe duke watched two live operations, of a breast reconstruction procedure and the removal of a bladder tumour. \n\nPrince William, who is president of the hospital trust, became the first royal to watch surgery at the cancer centre.\nTL;DR: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined poppy sellers at a London Tube station to support the annual appeal.\n\nArticle: By Laura BickerBBC News, Seoul\n\nAllegations which would once have been brushed aside have brought down some of the most prominent men in power, and women are coming forward to confront social norms that have silenced them for decades.\n\nBut can it last in a culture which often brands feminism a dirty word?\n\nJust last month singer Son Naeun of the popular group Apink was forced to defend a picture on Instagram of her holding a phone case which simply read\"Girls can do anything.\"She was accused of\"promoting feminism\"and deleted her post.\n\nAnd even after months of abuse revelations, those who speak up risk derision and suspicion.\n\nThe difference in 2018 is that many South Korean women appear willing to take that risk.\n\nIt took the first brave steps of a few to break down barriers.\n\nThe turning point came in January in a televised interview with the public prosecutor, Seo Ji-hyeon. She accused a former South Korean ministry of justice official of groping her during a funeral in 2010. He says he doesn't remember the incident.\n\nHer public revelation became a rallying cry. Prosecutors are the elite of South Korean society. Women started to think, if it can happen to her, and she can speak up, well why can't I?\n\nWithin the past few weeks, hundreds have come forward with their own cries of #MeToo. \n\nThe political world was shocked when rising star, and once presidential hopeful, Governor Ahn Hee-jung was accused of raping his secretary. He has resigned.\n\nPoems by Ko Un, once tipped for the Nobel Prize for Literature, will be erased from South Korean textbooks after he was accused of sexually harassing female literary hopefuls.\n\nAnd the director Kim Ki-duk, a Golden Lion winner at the Venice Film Festival, might not be able to release his new film as actresses have come forward with allegations of attempted rape.\n\nThese are high profile cases. But the problem appears to be systemic. \n\nConsider the major gender pay gap alone. \n\nWomen in South Korea earn only 63% of men's salaries - one of the highest pay gaps among 29 developed nations. The Economist also ranks South Korea as the worst developed nation in which to be a working woman, in its glass ceiling index. \n\nAnd there are few women in key positions of power in the workplace, as they make up only 2% of boardrooms, according to Forbes.\n\nThis is part of the problem, as the JoongAng Ilbo said in an editorial describing the workplace culture in South Korea:\"Those who seize power get to believe that they can do whatever they want to.\"\n\nIn quiet dinner conversations, my friends have told me about being young employees at big companies where you are encouraged to go for drinks after work to network and help your chances of promotion. \n\nEvery single one of them had a story about one of their superiors putting a hand on their knee, up their skirt, asking them if they'd like to stay in a hotel for the night. One even told me her boss took a picture up her skirt. The stories went on.\n\nThink that's just a few ladies talking over dinner? Think again. \n\nAt a marathon #MeToo protest in the centre of Seoul, 193 women stood at the microphone and told their experiences of sexual harassment for 2018 minutes non-stop. The AFP reporter, Hawon Jung, documented the event on Twitter, including this plea from a victim.\n\nIt's worth noting that where this event took place - Gwangwhamun Plaza in Seoul - is the same place where thousands gathered for the mass candlelight demonstrations against the now-ousted president Park Geun-hye last year. South Koreans know the power of protest. They have seen it topple a president.\n\nBut can it change an entire culture?\n\nThe current administration has said it plans to extend the statute to limitations of power-based sexual abuse cases, and it has pledged to set up a process for victims to report sexual abuse anonymously. \n\nMost women so far have been using an anonymous app called Blind to report abuse. At one point the company said there were around 500 posts a day.\n\nHowever, President Moon Jae-in noted as he addressed the #MeToo movement that South Korea\"cannot solve this through laws alone and we need to change our culture and attitude\".\n\nProf Joo Hee Lee, who teaches sociology at the all-female EWHA University, agrees.\n\n\"I think, most of all, the corporate culture should be changed. The South Korean corporate culture is characterised by an old boys' network - very closed relations. They've excluded women's voices and other diverse voices from management. So that must be corrected.\"\n\nThe legal system can also make it difficult for women's claims of abuse to be heard.\n\nLee Eun-eui took on the corporate giant Samsung Electro Mechanics after it failed to listen to her claims of abuse. \n\nShe reported it to human resources, only to find herself an outcast. At first she was given no work, then she was moved to a different department. She was told that no-one would be on her side.\n\n\"In the beginning I said the bigger the fight the bigger the reward,\"she told me.\"While that is a motto I apply to all different aspects of my life, the actual lawsuit was a very lonely and difficult process.\n\n\"But after going through the hardship and when it all ended well, I realised it was a fight that I had to do.\"\n\nIt took four years, but a court eventually ruled in her favour. She now has a new career as a lawyer helping other women with sex abuse cases.\n\n\"I'm very happy when people who come to get advice from me tell me that I am their role model. I think then that it was really worth fighting for.\"\n\nThere are other signs of change. Members of the younger generation are more aware of their rights and are keen to be assertive. I visited a university jiu-jitsu class where I was greeted by young women keen to talk about the #Metoo movement and\"girl power\"as they called it.  \n\nHee Won-sung, is studying law, and has also studied in the US. She can see a difference in attitude.\n\n\"I think it's far more difficult for women who've only lived in Korea because there's a traditional criteria that women have to be quiet and nice and kind and stuff, nowadays it's changing but it needs to change more.\"\n\nProf Lee feels that this new generation could provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"It's not been easy for younger women to speak up and confront or challenge the older man in power, but nowadays I think the generations of younger women are very well educated, they are more assertive and most of all they don't want to put up with older generations' ways of doing things, so I can see some hope there.\"\n\nThe new strength being shown by women in South Korea is not welcomed by all. Some have described it as\"man hate\"and say the movement is a witch hunt.\n\nBut there is a quiet determination, especially among young South Koreans, to change what they feel is wrong and sweep away the pillars of this once patriarchal society.\nTL;DR: Young women in South Korea are fighting for a new future. The #MeToo movement which has highlighted sexual harassment and abuse around the world has taken a surprising hold in this socially conservative country.\n\nArticle: Martin Hawtree - who designed American tycoon Donald Trump's current course at Menie - has been re-hired to plan the next development.\n\nThe 18-hole course would be situated to the south of the site.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump has stressed future work at his golf resort, including the new course, a hotel and golf lodges, are threatened by wind farm plans.\n\nThe \u00a3230m project off Aberdeen is a joint venture by Vattenfall, Technip and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (Areg).\n\nMr Trump claims the turbines would spoil the sea views for golfers on his course.\n\nSeveral organisations, such as Scottish Natural Heritage and RSPB Scotland, have dropped opposition to the wind farm.\nTL;DR: Design work for a second golf course close to the Trump International Links in Aberdeenshire is now under way.\n\nArticle: Parent Centrica has been trialling a digital-only\"challenger\"brand under the name British Gas X amid the highly competitive world of energy supply.\n\nThe company has been shedding customers and this month said it would cut 5,000 jobs.\n\nCentrica would not comment but is expected to give more details in July. \n\nA test website for British Gas X is already up and running.

So, are they actually in a position to rule?\n\nThat, of course, depends on many factors - local tribal support, economic viability, access to fuel and water, perceptions of their religious authority and that of their leader and self-appointed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and whether or not Isis overreach themselves.\n\n'Punching above its weight'\n\nSo far, Isis has enjoyed phenomenal short-term military success, largely through a combination of fear and firepower.\n\nEven if they were crushed tomorrow, military historians are unlikely to forget the effect of their blitzkrieg\"psyops\"campaign, the Isis psychological operation to terrify their opponents by flooding social media on the internet with gruesome images and videos of what happens to their enemies. \n\nThe sight of beheadings, crucifixions and summary executions, all filmed with a ghoulish commentary, was enough to make Iraq's poorly motivated security forces lay down their weapons and flee last month. \n\nBut Isis has effectively been\"punching above its weight\", to use a boxing analogy. \n\nAs the remnants and successors to a badly damaged\"al-Qaeda in Iraq\", the group had only about 10,000-15,000 fighters at most when it began taking over much of western Iraq in June. \n\nReportedly, Isis took over Mosul with no more than 800 fighters. But these were just the shock troops.\n\nIsis' fortunes were, and still are, heavily dependent on the support of local tribes and militias, without whom they could not hope to hold down a city of two million like Mosul. \n\n\"Isis' ability to control lands has been based on deals with local militants willing to do the'ruling' for them,\"says Mina al-Orabi, assistant editor of pan-Arab Ash-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper and originally from Mosul herself. \n\n\"Some of these deals are based on fear, others on a temporary meeting of interests, at times it is as crude as financial deals being struck between different gangs,\"she adds. \n\nMaintaining power, order and loyalty in the longer term will mean keeping those interests onside and sufficiently\"invested\"in rule by Isis.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nThe last time jihadists ruled a sizable chunk of Iraq for a sizable amount of time was when Isis' predecessors held sway over much of Anbar province in 2006, and they blew it.\n\nUnder the crude, brutal, and sadistic leadership of the Jordanian ex-convict, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the jihadists managed to alienate most of the local population. \n\nThey cut off the heads of Sunni sheikhs who refused to pledge allegiance, they blew up Shia mosques, trying to start a sectarian civil war, and they cut off the fingers of people they caught smoking (a practice they deem as un-Islamic). \n\nThis did not exactly win them hearts and minds. \n\nStop persecuting your fellow Muslims, implored al-Qaida's leadership back in Pakistan, but it was in vain - al-Zarqawi ignored his nominal masters. \n\nIn the end, Jordanian intelligence tracked him down, he died in a US airstrike and the jihadists were driven out by the local tribes backed by a\"surge\"of US troops. \n\nEight years on and the jihadists of Isis are firmly back in Anbar after a spectacular squandering of the advantage by the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, who sent troops to besiege a protest camp in Falluja late last year.\n\nSo has Isis learned from the mistakes of its antecedents? \n\nAsk some of the residents of Raqqa in north-east Syria, where Isis has been in control since May 2013, and they would say\"no\". \n\nStories abound of harsh punishments imposed for the slightest of offences, women being confined to the home, public crucifixions, kidnappings and extortionate levies imposed on businesses. \n\nOnce again, al-Qaeda's much diminished leadership scolded Isis or its excesses, and in February they formally disowned the whole organisation.\n\nOil and water\n\nBut others under Isis rule tell a different story. \n\nReports have filtered out of efficient municipal garbage collection, safer streets, generous distribution of fuel and food to the poor. \n\nSound familiar? This is exactly how the Taliban started out in Afghanistan in 1994, gradually increasing their territory until the 9/11 attacks on the US provoked the campaign that drove them from power in 2001. \n\nOne of the biggest advantages for a puritanical, religiously-cloaked militant organisation like Isis is the poor governance and perceived corruption of its secular alternative - the national government of Iraq.\n\nTo succeed as a viable state, let alone as a transnational\"caliphate\", Isis will need access to oil and water. \n\nIt has both. In Syria its forces control the oil-producing region around Deir Az-zour, including Syria's largest oilfield at al-Omar, reportedly even selling oil to their enemies, the Assad regime itself. \n\nThey also control Syria's largest dam, the Tabqa Dam at Lake Assad. \n\nIn Iraq they control the Falluja dam and have some, disputed, access to Iraq's largest oil refinery at Baiji. In a part of the world where oil and water are the two key commodities, Isis finds itself in a powerful position.\n\n'Jihadistan'?\n\nLeaving aside for now whether or not the wider Muslim umma (community) will accept the recently proclaimed khilafa (caliphate) of Isis - and it has been swiftly denounced by many Muslim scholars - the fact remains that Isis controls a large area of the Middle East and it is not going away.\n\nNeither the forces of President Assad in Syria, nor the forces of the Iraqi government alone can dislodge Isis from the ground it has taken, it is too well entrenched. \n\nSyrian air strikes will have some impact, so will Iraq's newly bought Sukhoi-25 jets and assistance from the US and Iran, but ultimately this is about holding onto territory on the ground. \n\nThe only force capable of permanently ejecting Isis will be the tribes in those regions, and they have little incentive to do so while the Syrian civil war rages on and a non-inclusive government sits in Baghdad, led by a Shia prime minister perceived as discriminating against Sunnis.\n\nWhich leaves the prospect of a violent, extremist, well-armed, well-funded and religiously intolerant militia becoming a permanent part of the Middle East landscape, a sort of de facto\"jihadistan\". \n\nWould it stop there? \n\nUnlikely. As far back as last year its adherents were proclaiming their ultimate aim of conquering territory as far away as Spain (ruled by Muslims for centuries as al-Andalus), Austria and China. \n\nEven if Isis remained within the boundaries of the areas it has taken so far, it would likely be a springboard for attacks on neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, as well as attracting hundreds of young jihadists from the UK and the wider West. \n\nShiraz Maher, an expert on the Syrian jihad at King's College London, says there is little appetite for concerted international action to dislodge them.\n\n\"The fact Isis has taken a large amount of territory is not unique. We've seen jihadist organisations achieve this in the past, for example, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Horn of Africa, and Mali most recently. \n\n\"In every one of those cases, Western-backed intervention tipped the balance against jihadist gains. That's the key difference here. Both Iraq and Syria are failed states with ineffective armies, and there is no appetite in the West to intervene.\"\n\nIsis, concludes Mr Maher, could therefore continue to hold their ground, ruling an area the size of Pennsylvania for the foreseeable future. \n\nBut Mina al-Orabi believes there are signs that Isis deals with local militants are already starting to unravel, meaning:\n\n\"Isis can only rule depending on brute violence or the threat of using it.\"\nTL;DR: Can Isis - the small but fanatical jihadist army now controlling large tracts of Syria and Iraq - rule the lands it has conquered?\n\nArticle: Jordan Begley, 23, died in hospital two hours after he was shot by a police officer with the stun gun at his home in Gorton, Manchester, in July 2013.\n\nHis mother Dorothy called police after a row escalated with neighbours.\n\nManchester Civil Courts of Justice heard Mr Begley threatened to stab a neighbour as the 999 call was made. \n\n'Going to be murder'\n\nHugh Davies QC, representing PC Terence Donnelly, who is said to have shot the stun gun, and four other officers involved in the incident, read part of the transcript from Mrs Begley's 999 call to the court.\n\nShe had barred Jordan from leaving the house they shared after he had been accused of stealing a handbag by a neighbour amid threats of revenge.\n\nHer son, who was a heavy drinker and used cocaine, was heard protesting his innocence and shouting at his neighbour, saying he will get a\"knife right in his face\".\n\nMrs Begley told the call handler:\"There's going to be murder.\"\n\nMr Davies said:\"He was a threat to other people with the knife in the mood he was in.\"\n\nShe replied:\"If I let him go out he probably would have used it.\"\n\nThe court heard when police arrived Mr Begley was calm at first but became\"extremely agitated\"and swore at officers to get out of\"his house\". \n\nMr Davies reminded the jury Mrs Begley previously said as she left the house her son had a look on his face that said,'mum help me' as the officer pointed the Taser at him.\n\nAsked why she did not help, Mrs Begley said she did not think they would Taser him\"because he was not doing anything\"and he\"did nothing that deserved being Tasered\".\n\nMr Begley was Tasered from a distance of 70cm (27ins) then hit with\"distraction strikes\"as police restrained and handcuffed him, the inquest has heard.  He was not armed.\n\nMr Begley then become unwell and was admitted to hospital, where he died.\n\nThe inquest continues.\nTL;DR: A mother warned a 999 call handler her son had a \"violent nature\" before he was Tasered and died, an inquest has heard.\n\nArticle: The round of clapping was inspired by the weekly Clap for Carers initiative to thank key workers during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBoris Johnson said he celebrated with staff who\"quite simply, saved my life\"after he caught the virus.\n\nIt is hoped the anniversary applause will become an annual tradition.\n\nSpeaking after applauding outside Downing Street, Boris Johnson tweeted:\"Thank you to the whole NHS family and all of our carers for all you have done and continue to do to keep us well and cared for.\n\n\"In these past few months, indeed the past 72 years, you have represented the very best of this country. Our gratitude to you will be eternal.\"\n\nHe later added in a statement that he had marked the occasion with staff from St Thomas' Hospital, who cared for him when he was admitted to hospital with coronavirus in April.\n\nA World War Two Spitfire plane with the words\"Thank U NHS\"painted on its underside tipped its wings above hospitals and the homes of fundraisers and volunteers, recognising the way people have supported the NHS and local communities during the pandemic.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the celebrations were\"very personal for me\"as his late mother was a nurse and later relied on the health service when she became ill.\n\nHe said:\"Many, many times she got gravely ill and it was the NHS that she turned to, and I remember as a boy, a teenager, being in high dependency units, in intensive care units, with my mum, watching nurses and other support staff keep my mum alive.\n\n\"They did that on more than one occasion - it's etched in my memory. For them, it was just the day job. They were doing that every day.\"\n\nThe National Health Service was launched on 5 July 1948, with the core principle that it is free at the point of delivery and is based on clinical need.\n\nAs part of a weekend of anniversary events, UK landmarks were lit up blue in celebration and remembrance on Saturday.\n\nDowning Street, the Royal Albert Hall, Blackpool Tower, the Shard and the Wembley Arch were all illuminated and a minute's silence was held to remember those who have died during the pandemic.\n\nThe latest government figures, released on Sunday, showed a further 22 people had died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 44,220.\n\nPeople were also asked to place lights in their windows in a show of remembrance on Saturday night, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, lighting a candle in Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nFirst Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon was among officials joining in with the nationwide applause on Sunday evening.\n\nIn a video message she said the country was\"depending more than ever\"on its health and care workers, and thanked them\"from the bottom of my heart\". \n\nFirst Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, said NHS staff and social care workers were\"all heroes\".\n\nAnd Captain Tom Moore - who raised more than \u00a332m for the health service by walking laps of his garden during lockdown - shared a video of himself clapping from his armchair at home in Bedfordshire.\n\nThe idea for Sunday's round of applause was inspired by the success of the weekly Clap for Carers, which saw households across the country show their appreciation for the NHS and other key workers during the lockdown.\n\nAnnemarie Plas, who founded the Clap for Carers initiative, joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside No 10 for the clap at 17:00 BST.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast on Sunday morning, she said:\"We have had this first part of the crisis, we don't know what lies ahead, so if we can have this one moment where we say thank you to each other and recharge our batteries for what may be a heavier time that lies ahead, then I think that is a beautiful moment.\"\n\nShe said the NHS helped her when she arrived in the UK from the Netherlands as a new mother,\"so I feel very happy to be in touch with the NHS this way\".\n\nMs Plas added that the celebrations were\"not just about the NHS\"but about others who have also\"sacrificed so much\"during the pandemic - such as\"delivery workers, teachers, parents, good neighbours\".\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge praised healthcare workers on a visit to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Norfolk.\n\nThe couple chatted to staff and volunteers about how they coped during the first wave of the epidemic. \n\nThe Prince of Wales paid tribute to staff working through\"the most testing time in the service's history\".\n\nIn a video message to mark the occasion, Prince Charles spoke of his gratitude and pride for the\"costly sacrifices\"of NHS staff.\n\n\"Despite all that has been endured, there is deep cause for gratitude, and a true reason for pride,\"he said.\n\nThe prince also said the pandemic had brought out the best in people, adding:\"This renewal of our community spirit has been a silver lining during this dark time.\"\n\nSpeaking at a rally celebrating seven decades of the health service, Labour leader Sir Keir said NHS staff needed a pay rise in the wake of the pandemic. \n\n\"It's very important that we don't just say thanks, but recognise in a meaningful way what the NHS has done,\"he said.\n\nHis comments come after unions representing more than 1.3 million nurses, cleaners, physiotherapists, healthcare assistants, dieticians, radiographers, porters, midwives, paramedics and other NHS employees wrote to the chancellor and the prime minister calling for pay talks to start soon.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 protesters gathered at Marble Arch in London, calling for the end of racial disparity in the health system.\n\nOne of the organisers, Tyrek Morris, 21, told the crowd:\"We are protesting for black lives and one of the demands we have is to abolish the racial disparity within the NHS, especially towards black women.\n\n\"We need to implement extensive measures to prevent the disproportionate suffering of black women in healthcare and bring to an end the significantly increased black maternal mortality rate.\"\n\nHow are you marking the anniversary of the NHS?

The external facades, a nod to the enormous hull of the famous cruise liner.\n\nThe panels used to create the shard-like cladding that adorns the side of the structure are from Carryduff, on the outskirts of the city.\n\nEnniskillen produced tonnes of steel work which runs through the inside of the building - all installed by local men and women.\n\nNorthern Ireland's newest landmark stands in the heart of east Belfast - only a few minutes walk from the old drawing rooms where Thomas Andrews drafted the design for the world's most famous vessel.\n\nThe parallels between the Titanic and the visitor centre bearing its name continue - the architecture firm responsible for Belfast's answer to Bilbao's Guggenheim is based less than a mile away in the Cathedral Quarter.\n\nNorthern Ireland Tourism Minister Arlene Foster said:\"Only Belfast can tell the complete story of the world-famous RMS Titanic. This project will give potential tourists a compelling reason to visit.\"\n\nIt is also hoped that the attraction will have a major impact on the Northern Ireland tourism industry.\n\nChairman of Belfast Harbour, Len O'Hagan said:\"Belfast harbour already attracts 60,000 cruise passengers and crew every year and over 1.2m ferry passengers.

Sights and sounds of the period surround the visitor as silhouettes of characters stroll through the recreated streets, a reminder that this is more than a museum.\n\nSenior designer Steve Lumby's job was to pick the best technology to tell the story, but he said it was not all about expensive special effects.\n\n\"There is some very interesting technology, but let me emphasise that the narrative is the key element - the technology follows,\"he said.\n\n\"The ultimate aim is for people to get a real sense of the effort that went into constructing that ship... from design and technology, but also from the sheer manpower, the skill of the workers.\"\n\nOnce through the old streets of Belfast, visitors take a trip up a replica of the Arrol Gantry - at 100 metres, the largest crane of its day.\n\nNext comes an interactive journey on the'shipyard ride,' where the visitor can get a sense of what life in the shipyard may have been like.\n\nYou are assailed by the sights, sounds and smells of a turn-of-the-20th-Century dry dock - including even the heat from welding irons.\n\nThe story of the Titanic is not entirely one of tragedy, but is also what lead project manager, Noel Molloy, described as\"one of the greatest stories of human endeavour\".\n\n\"Here in Belfast 100 years ago, 3,000 men took three years to build the largest vessel the world had ever seen,\"he said.\n\nThe ship was launched from Belfast, 31 May 1911 and the visitor centre will be opened almost 100 years to the day from when Titanic sunk on its ill-fated maiden voyage.\n\nWhen asked why people should visit the centre, Mr Molloy said:\"We've built a truly iconic building, put in the world's largest Titanic exhibit and we're dealing with one of the greatest stories the world has ever known.\"\n\nTitanic Belfast has already generated \u00a31m from pre-booking of tours and ticket sales.\n\nOver 90,000 tickets have been sold to people in over 20 different countries around the world - and that's before the doors have even opened.\nTL;DR: There is less than a day to go before the biggest tourist attraction ever built in Northern Ireland opens its doors to the world.\n\nArticle: At the service, King was praised for showing no bitterness to the officers who beat him in 1991.\n\nThe officers involved in the beating were acquitted the following year, sparking clashes in which 50 died.\n\nKing was found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool last month at the age of 47.

Although the firm has not provided official Chinese player numbers for Overwatch, gamers in the country have been estimated to make up about half of its five million players worldwide for the WoW franchise.\n\nReleased in May 2016, the first-person shooter game has reportedly gained a loyal following of over 20m registered players. \n\nEach battle has two teams of six gamers, and players, represented in the game by a\"hero\"character, have to secure and defend various points on an online map before time runs out. \n\nCosmetic rewards like individual victory poses and the special Lunar New Year character skins are a popular feature of the game. However, they do not add any gameplay value. \n\nJourney to the West\"skins\"available\n\n'Sanzang' Zenyatta: This divine being calls upon\"orbs of harmony\"to heal teammates and weaken opponents. The character is based on Xuanzang, a monk sent on a mission to fetch a set of scriptures back to China to spread Buddhism.\n\n'Wujing' Reinhardt: Originally a general in heaven, Sha Wujing, or Sandy Monk was exiled to earth where he became a man-eating demon. His modern video game counterpart is equally fierce and equipped with weapons, including his iconic staff, allowing him to charge and pin enemies on the front line.\n\n'Bajie' Roadhog: Modelled after the novel's Zhu Bajie, who is part human, part pig, this hardy hero can withstand tremendous damage and can recover his health with a short breather. He uses his signature Chain Hook to pull his enemies close before shredding them with blasts from his Scrap Gun.\n\n'Wukong' Winston: Inspired by Chinese mythological figure Sun Wukong (also known as Monkey God) and boasting incredible strength, this is the most popular character of all. Winston comes equipped with a jump pack and wields an electricity-blasting cannon. He is a skilled fighter, capable of holding his own against the best warriors of heaven.\n\n\"We've had special seasonal content for years now in our other games and doing something similar in Overwatch seemed like a natural fit,\"a Blizzard spokesperson told BBC News.\n\n\"While it was inspired by an Asian celebration, it's not something meant to only serve players in Asia - all players can enjoy the Year of the Rooster.\"\n\nFireworks, pagodas, lion dancers and traditional cheongsam dresses are all part of a promotional trailer for the game, which drew close to 25,000 retweets and 40,000 likes.\n\n\"The Chinese elements in the new Overwatch skins look so beautiful,\"said Beijing gamer Ning in response to it on the popular Sina Weibo micro-blogging site.\"Now we can bring the New Year spirit into our matches.\"\n\nThe special Lunar New Year series generated buzz and raised excitement among gamers on Reddit.\n\n\"It's awesome how they incorporated Journey to the West characters into the heroes and made them work really well,\"said Reddit user Azurezefer.\n\nFor other users like Chinese gamer Matt Wang, Winston the Monkey King was his favourite. \n\n\"It's definitely worth every penny.

People didn't want them. \n\nMore accurately - people outside London didn't want them. The capital voted for an assembly and got it in 1998. \n\nNext in line for a dose of autonomy was the North East, but after voters sounded an unequivocal\"no\"to that idea, plans for referendums in the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber were scrapped.  \n\nA few local innovations got off the ground in the form of city mayors and regional development agencies (RDAs), but have since fallen out of favour. Ten cities voted\"no\"to mayors in 2012 and RDAs were mothballed in favour of smaller local enterprise partnerships.\n\nThe coalition's attempt to coax people into\"engaging\"with local politics came in the form of American-style police chiefs, elected in 2012. \n\nVoters voted with their feet by staying at home. Turnout was less than 15%. \n\n'Gathering dust'\n\nSupport for the idea of regional assemblies or an English parliament - a chamber where English MPs vote on English laws - remains relatively low at 15% and 19% respectively. \n\nIn 2012, the government asked Sir William McKay to examine this problem. His recommendations, in the words of Prof John Curtice of Strathclyde University, are at present\"gathering dust\".\n\nAnd yet, there is still a feeling that something is wrong in England. \n\nThe latest British Social Attitudes report found that 62% of English people believe Scottish MPs should not be able to vote on English laws - and the proportion who agree\"strongly\"has risen over the past decade.  \n\nIpsos Mori found that 56% of people would back increased powers for England to control its own taxes and spending. \n\nLess pronounced - but still present - is the 44% of people who feel Scotland gets more than its fair share of public spending (30% think it is about right).\n\nSo why don't people in England seem to want more powers?\n\n'Imposed from above'\n\nOne theory is devolution has been tainted by what happened in the North East. \n\nArianna Giovannini of Leeds Metropolitan University observes:\"It was perceived as a project of London and an attempt by Labour to win party political support with little bottom-up interest.\"\n\nEx-Labour MP Hilton Dawson - who recently founded the North East Party - agrees that 2004\"has been allowed to damage the wider cause\".\n\nIt still rankles with Stephen Richardson, a councillor and parliamentary candidate for Mebyon Kernow, Cornwall, who says the referendum\"was imposed by Tony Blair's government from above; they hadn't asked for it\".  \n\nWhereas Mebyon Kernow had 50,000 signatures on a petition for a Cornish assembly\"and the Labour government threw it in the bin\".\n\nIn Yorkshire others have not-so-fond memories of the North-East referendum.\n\n\"We were promised one back then but I'm not sure we would've been more likely to say yes. The reality was the powers offered were so pathetic,\"says Stewart Arnold, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire Devolution Movement, a non-party campaign for a parliament in Yorkshire.\n\nWhen it comes to English devolution, another question is whether English people share enough of a sense of identity to want to be governed together. \n\nEddie Bone, who manages the Campaign for an English Parliament, maintains there is an English identity and the 2011 census demonstrated its strength.\n\nOthers say regional and local ties are stronger - and can be contested within relatively small areas. \n\nExeter University's Dr Joanie Willett (a former Mebyon Kernow candidate) points to the European electoral regions as an example. \n\n\"The South West is huge. You'd have a fight on your hands if you said Cornish people shared their identity with nextdoor Devon, let alone people in Swindon.\"\n\nThe referendum effect\n\nAnother barrier to change is that England is already divided into established local authorities. Would people balk at the prospect of another layer of bureaucracy and politicians?\n\nNot necessarily, according to Mr Arnold, who believes people are more suspicious of Westminster than of local politicians.  \n\n\"Look at Alex Salmond and Boris Johnson, who've both gained enormous popularity through arguing for more powers on their patch.\"\n\nMr Dawson says when he founded his party he was\"surprised\"by the number of people who showed an interest. \n\n\"I think it connected with a frustration people feel here with the way things are being done.\"\n\nWhat these campaigners agree on is that the Scottish independence debate has strengthened their arm.\n\n\"Devolution is in the news a lot more,\"says Mr Richardson. Mr Arnold says:\"It's focused people's minds, though not enough.\"\n\nThere are other reasons, too, for devolutionists to be cheerful. \n\nThe designation of Cornish people as a protected minority and Mebyon Kernow's endorsement by the Green Party of England and Wales prompts Mr Richardson to venture:\"These are good times for Celtic peoples.\"\n\nMr Bone is heartened by the recent electoral success of UKIP. \n\n\"It's not UKIP official policy but definitely we know a lot of their grassroots supporters support our campaign and we're encouraged by that.\"\n\nBut will the ideas of these regional crusaders ever enter the political mainstream? \n\nThere are some modest signs Westminster politicians are becoming more willing to touch on the issue, even if it still is at bargepole's length.\n\nScotland Secretary Alistair Carmichael has spoken in favour of English devolution, while George Osborne casts his eyes northwards and Ed Miliband touts the prospect of \u00a330bn to boost growth in regions outside London.\n\nCome September, Scotland will get more power, whether that is through independence or further devolution.\n\nWith that in mind, converts to devolution may yet turn to Cornwall, Yorkshire and the North East for inspiration.\nTL;DR: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all successfully wrested power away from Westminster - and Scotland will soon hold a referendum on whether to break away altogether. Could England be next to flex its muscles?\n\nArticle: By Rebecca JohnBBC Wales Today\n\nClive Hally, 67, was arrested earlier this year on suspicion of indecent assault, following allegations of historical child sexual abuse at Brynteg Comprehensive School, Bridgend.\n\nThe retired teacher was on police bail, when he was found dead on 18 May.\n\nHe is thought to have killed himself before a charging decision was taken.\n\nHis body was found floating on the edge of the Cwmwernderi reservoir near Maesteg. Police say there were no suspicious circumstances.\n\nHis inquest will be held in November - a police investigation into the allegations is ongoing and an independent investigation will be conducted.\n\nHally, who was from Maesteg, taught art at Brynteg for 36 years, from 1975 until 2011. \n\nTwo men, now aged 48 and 50, said he sexually abused them on school premises in the 1980s, one when he was aged 13.\n\nThe other victim said he was assaulted multiple times, from the age of 15.\n\nTheir names have been changed to protect their identities.\n\nTheir allegations contain descriptions of child sexual abuse which some readers may find upsetting.\n\nMike claims he was abused in a locked photography darkroom, an art storeroom, disused toilets and elsewhere at Brynteg, after school and during school holidays, from when he was in Year 10, until after he left school at A-level. \n\nHe was made to perform sex acts on the teacher and receive them. \n\n\"He'd take me by the hand we'd go into the storeroom and it would be maybe 5 or 5:30, something like that, and I'd end up getting undressed...  and it's odd, I can't remember Clive saying anything,\"said Mike, now 48.\n\n\"I think he would undress me. I don't remember me wanting to get undressed. I think he did it to me. \n\n\"Lots of awful things would happen. I didn't want to touch him.    \n\n\"So I'd be in the storeroom and I'd focus on, like a stapler or a door handle or a jug of pencils or something. It's a crazy thing - I didn't want to disappoint. \n\n\"But also, I didn't know how to get out of there - I didn't want to do any of this. \n\n\"But you're in this position and you don't know what to do.  \n\n\"I can remember being naked and lying on a wooden counter, a sort of desk, where he kept lots of paper. I just wanted it to end really quickly.\"\n\nDavid, who's now 50, said Hally touched him sexually in an incident in the art store room when he was 13.\n\nHe said he had endured years of unwanted and inappropriate physical attention - including hugs and kisses, and they were once interrupted by a supply teacher.   \n\n\"People must have known that things were going on because we were interrupted and I know I'm not the only person,\"said David.\n\n\"He was at this school from 1970 something to 2011, so there's a big period there where he had the opportunity to do things. \n\n\"I've learned that some staff did have concerns about the way that he conducted himself, to the point where they knew he would be one-to-one with boys in his art room and he'd lock the door. \n\n\"The bottom line is the man was a paedophile. It's unbelievable really, when you think about it. That word should be associated with that man, as that's what he was. \n\n\"There are more kids out there who've been abused, that's a definite, an absolute definite. \n\n\"Paedophiles don't stop abusing children, so for years in that school there was an active paedophile, and people should know.\"\n\nThe men have heard a group of teachers did once raise concerns later in Hally's career about him spending time alone with boys in the art room, but it is unclear what action was taken.\n\nThe school has declined to respond to questions about this from the BBC, and whether it ever received complaints about his conduct during his career.\n\nIn a statement, the school responded:\"We value and promote the safety and wellbeing of all our pupils and take these historical allegations very seriously. We will be working alongside partners such as Bridgend County Borough Council to look into the allegations independently.\"\n\nThe council said:\"We support schools in having effective safeguarding procedures in place, which can be followed in the event that any allegations are received.\n\n\"While the council does not have any record on file of these historical allegations having been raised with us as a local authority, we will be looking into them independently in conjunction with all relevant partners.\"\n\nSouth Wales Police said the two victims in the investigation have been updated and offered support by specially trained officers.\n\n\"South Wales Police takes all reports of sexual assault seriously and urges victims to come forward to report it, regardless of when it happened, safe in the knowledge that they will be treated with respect and dignity and that their allegation will be fully investigated,\"said a police official.\n\n\"In circumstances such as these, where an alleged or suspected perpetrator is deceased, specially trained officers will continue to take a victim's account and investigate as far as is possible. Victims will also have access to support from a range of partner agencies.\"\n\nThe Children's Commissioner for Wales, Sally Holland, has said she will follow-up the cases with both the school and local authority.\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by the serious allegations that have been brought to light today, and I encourage anybody with related information to contact South Wales Police, who are investigating the matter,\"she said.\n\n\"Following developments today, I will be seeking assurances from the school about their safeguarding arrangements and asking them to be clear with existing pupils and parents about the procedures they have in place to protect children.\n\n\"I will also be seeking clarity from the local authority about its investigation and writing to the local safeguarding board to establish its role in all this.\"\n\nIf you have been affected by child sexual abuse, sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at BBC Action Line\n\nIf you want to raise any of the matters discussed here with BBC Wales, you can also contact the BBC Wales News Focus team in confidence by email at: news.focus.team@bbc.co.uk\nTL;DR: Two men have revealed how they were sexually abused by their art teacher while they were pupils at a secondary school in the 1980s.\n\nArticle: The UK government's Trade Union Act has rules that means action affecting key services will only be allowed if backed by 40% of eligible voters in a ballot.\n\nBut Welsh Labour's assembly election manifesto in May included a promise to repeal changes affecting devolved services such as health and education.\n\nBBC Wales understands it is one of six bills set to be introduced this year.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones has said he will try to pass a Welsh law on strikes, even if it results in another Supreme Court battle with the UK government over where responsibility lies.\n\nA UK government spokesman said:\"The Trade Union Act relates to employment rights, duties and industrial relations, all of which are clearly reserved matters for the UK parliament under the Welsh devolution settlement.\"\n\nE-cigarettes\n\nA leaked letter, written by a UK government minister, indicated legal advice suggested there was a\"very weak case\"that politicians in Westminster have the power over provisions in the Trade Union Act relating to Wales. \n\nMr Jones previously said a public health bill would be tabled again but would not include plans to ban e-cigarettes in some public places.\n\nThe original version of public health bill failed to pass on the last day of the previous assembly after a row between Labour and Plaid Cymru.\n\nIt is also expected the Welsh Government's legislative programme will include plans to scrap the right-to-buy scheme in a bid to protect the stock of social housing.\nTL;DR: A new law removing restrictions on public sector strikes is being proposed by the Welsh Government.\n\nArticle: They held signs and chanted slogans for Kader, 23, an LGBT activist, whose burned body was discovered in a forest after she went missing. \n\nAccording to one report, opposition MPs were among those who attended the rare protest by LGBT activists. \n\nPolice with water cannon were on duty nearby, AFP news agency said.\n\nMs Kader, a sex worker, was last seen entering a client's car one night.

has accused the sellers of PPI in engaging in a widespread\"protection racket\".\n\nThey have accused lenders and others of selling the insurance alongside loans when it was unnecessary, without telling the borrower they were even paying for a policy, or of selling policies on which the borrower could not in fact claim.\n\nThe financial services industry has been engaged in a behind-the-scenes campaign to deter the regulator from bringing in the new sanctions, arguing that they are either unnecessary or disproportionate.\n\nBut the FSA has finally decided to act.\n\n\"Today is the culmination of months of hard work and now, with these measures, we look forward to consumers being treated fairly whether they are buying or complaining about PPI,\"said Dan Waters of the FSA.    \n\n\"Since we took over the regulation of PPI we've carried out 24 investigations and three thematic reviews, issued warnings, halted the selling of single premium PPI with unsecured personal loans, visited over 200 firms, and handed out some very significant fines,\"he added.\n\nGreater mis-selling\n\nThere has been a dramatic increase in the number of PPI complaints in the past two to three years, alongside highly critical investigations by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission.\n\nHowever, the FSA explained that firms had been turning down almost half of the PPI complaints they received, and that some had rejected nearly all their complaints.\n\nAbout 30% of those people had turned to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS)  for help, where about 80% of the complaints were then upheld.\n\n\"Where complaints are referred to the FOS, the FOS continues to overturn in favour of the consumer the great majority of firms' decisions rejecting the complaints,\"the FSA said. \n\n\"These trends suggest that there is an even greater extent of mis-selling and potential consumer detriment than we had assumed in [2009] and that makes the need and case for an effective approach to addressing such detriment stronger, not weaker,\"it added.\n\nThe key features of the new rules are that if someone complains:\n\nThe FOS revealed that it had dealt with more than 100,000 PPI complaints already, with just over 48,000 arriving in the past financial year and an extra 21,000 coming in since 1 April this year.\n\n\"We hope to see complaint numbers fall over time as firms deal with them better in the first instance,\"the FOS said.\n\nImpending ban\n\nThe FSA's estimate of how much will have to be reimbursed in total is based on an assumption that some lenders will contact people who may not have complained, but who might still have been sold a policy wrongly.\n\nLast year, firms were told to re-open 185,000 old complaints they had previously rejected.\n\n\"For years, the industry has handled poorly thousands of PPI complaints so it's important that the FSA is able to force firms to review old cases,\"said Which? chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith.\n\n\"We want the government to act swiftly and activate the FSA's power to force lenders to review rejected PPI cases so consumers whose complaints were wrongly dismissed can get the redress they are due,\"he added.\n\nThe Competition Commission is expected shortly to announce its own rules to prohibit the sale of PPI policies at the point when someone is granted a loan.\n\nLast month, Lloyds became the first bank to break ranks with the rest of the industry when it decided to would stop selling PPI to its own borrowers.\n\nHSBC stopped selling PPI polices in November 2007\"across all the HSBC group of companies\", a spokesman said.\nTL;DR: Two and three quarter million people could be refunded as much as \u00a32.7bn for being mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI).\n\nArticle: The ten rare unpublished letters were sent between 1944 and 1960 to his friend, Captain Bernard Acworth. \n\nCS Lewis is best known for his children's series The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nCaptain Acworth's son Richard and granddaughter Phyllida handed over the letters in a ceremony.\n\nCaptain Acworth was the founder of the Evolution Protest Movement, an organisation opposed to the teaching of evolution as scientific fact.\n\nIn the letters, Lewis outlined his own views on religion and the origins of life. \n\nCaptain Acworth's son, Reverend Dr Richard Acworth said his father and Lewis first became close after he wrote to the author about the issue. \n\n\"My father had a particular view: he was strongly opposed to the teaching of evolution of being certainly true and the full explanation of things and he got in touch with CS Lewis about this,\"he said. \n\n\"Originally Lewis was more or less agnostic on that subject but it seems in the course of the correspondence he gradually became much more of my father's way of thinking.\"\n\nHe said the letters contained insights into various aspects of Lewis' private life,\"including when he married his wife at her bedside in hospital as she was dying of cancer and she seemed to make a miraculous recovery\".\n\n\"He also talks of visiting Donegal, describing the scenery in north Donegal as'lovely' and south Donegal as having a'sinister character'.\n\n\"I am delighted that my daughter Phyllida, a Queen's English graduate, is here with me today. \n\n\"I know my father would have been happy to have his letters preserved as part of the CS Lewis collection at Queen's.\"\n\nDeirdre Wildy, head of special collections and archives at Queen's, said:\"We are delighted to be in receipt of the Acworth Collection, and will be pleased to facilitate access to the letters as they are likely to be of great interest to researchers in several subject areas.\n\n\"This generous donation will be a valuable addition to our manuscript holdings in Special Collections and Archives at Queen's.\"\nTL;DR: Letters written by Belfast-born writer CS Lewis to a friend have been donated to Queen's University.\n\nArticle: Tickets have sold out for the festival of music and arts, which will feature Suede, Steve Coogan, Ralph Fiennes, Sadler's Wells and Shappi Khorsandi.\n\nFestival director Melvin Benn said he was not concerned by forecasts of rain.\n\n\"Brits in general are hardy people and I don't think a bit of rain will spoil the enjoyment.\"\n\nMr Benn, who said the\"beautiful\"surroundings of Henham Park had played a key part in the festival's success, highlighted Ed Sheeran and James Blake as acts to watch this weekend.\n\n\"The music is fantastic but when you couple that with things like Sadler's Wells and the National Theatre of Scotland you're looking at real quality.\"\n\nBBC Radio Suffolk is broadcasting live from the festival throughout the weekend.\nTL;DR: Thirty five thousand people are expected to attend the sixth Latitude Festival, taking place this weekend at Henham Park near Southwold.\n\nArticle: By Kathy HarcombeBBC News, Israel\n\nAdam was 18 when he arrived in Israel in 2011. Attackers had burned down his home in Darfur at the height of the genocide, and he had spent his teenage years in a UN refugee camp in another part of Sudan. With no prospects in the camp and no sign of an end to the conflict in Darfur, he made his way north through Egypt and the lawless Sinai peninsula to Israel.\n\nBut Israel - which has approved fewer than 1% of asylum applications since it signed the UN Refugee Convention six decades ago - has not offered asylum to a single person from Sudan. It turned down Adam's application, and last October, when he went to renew the temporary permit allowing him to stay in the country, he was summoned to a detention centre known as Holot, deep in the Negev desert.\n\nThis was no surprise for Adam. As most Sudanese and Eritreans in Israel know, it's just a matter of time before they get the call to Holot. \n\nThe government calls Holot an\"open-stay centre\", but it's run by the prison service and rules are strict, including a night-time curfew, which, if broken, will land you in jail. \n\nIt's in such an isolated area that there's very little to do and nowhere to go. \n\nI talked to Adam and a group of his friends just outside the gates of Holot, where, at that time, they spent most of their day playing cards or snooker, and eating and cooking in makeshift restaurants. \n\nThey told me they took turns to make the hour-long bus ride into the nearest town, Beersheva, where they bought food. The meals served in Holot were insufficient, they said, and contained little meat or protein.\n\nMost of the men there were young - in their 20s or early 30s. Some had been teachers, activists or students in their own countries. \n\n\"We are wasting our youth here,\"Adam says.\"If someone lives in Holot, they have no future... You find many people here go crazy.\"\n\nSince I visited Holot, those makeshift restaurants and game areas have all been demolished on the orders of the government, leaving those inside with even fewer ways to pass the time.\n\nAdam will be held in Holot for 12 months. Then he is likely to face a stark choice:\n\nThe Israeli government has deals with two countries in Africa to host its unwanted migrants. \n\nIt promises that people who take the option of\"voluntary departure to third countries\"will receive papers on arrival that give them legal status in the country. \n\nFind out more \n\nWatch Kathy Harcombe's TV report for Focus on Africa on BBC World News at 17:30 GMT, Wednesday 3 February. \n\nAs an extra incentive, they're given $3,500 (\u00a32,435) in cash, handed over in the departure lounge of the airport in Tel Aviv. \n\nIsrael refuses to name the two African countries but the BBC has spoken to migrants who say they were sent to Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nOne is Tesfay, an Eritrean who was flown to Rwanda in March 2015, and he told me that far from being offered legal status, a home and the chance of a job in Rwanda - as he had been promised in Israel - he became a victim of trafficking.\n\nHis identity papers - a travel document and a single-entry visa to Rwanda, both issued in Israel - were immediately confiscated at Kigali airport, he says.\n\nThen, along with nine other Eritreans, he was taken to a\"guest house\". None of them was allowed out. It would be dangerous without papers, they were told. Then, two days after arriving, the men were told it was time to leave.\n\n\"You are going to Uganda. But before you go, you need to pay $150,\"said a man who introduced himself as John.\"Then from the border to Kampala you need to pay again.\"\n\nCrammed into a minibus, they made the six-hour journey to the Ugandan border, where they were told to get out of the bus.\n\n\"When we crossed the border, that's when I understood that we were being smuggled,\"Tesfay says.\"We went on foot, silently. We were being smuggled from one state to another.\"\n\nAs promised by\"John\", they had to pay another $150 to continue their journey to the Ugandan capital, Kampala. \n\nBut inevitably, having entered as illegal immigrants, they were arrested on arrival and put behind bars - after police had relieved them of about half the cash in their pockets, Tesfay says. \n\nWith what was left, Tesfay managed to post bail. He was due to appear in court five days later and having already been warned he was likely to be deported to Eritrea - the repressive authoritarian state he had fled in the first place - he decided to take no chances. He paid another smuggler to get him into Kenya, where he is now seeking asylum.\n\nRwanda has never confirmed that it struck a deal to host Israel's unwanted migrants. The Ugandan government, for its part, has denied outright that such a deal exists - it told the BBC it was investigating how migrants who claimed to have been sent from Israel were entering the country. \n\nThe BBC spoke to a man from Darfur who said he was flown to Uganda from Israel with seven others in 2014, before the third country policy became official.\n\nFor safety reasons, he asked to remain anonymous. \n\n\"None of the things I was promised were given to me,\"he said.\"No documents, no passport, no assistance - nothing. (Israel) just wants to take people and dump them.\"\n\nIn October, Israeli immigration authorities said 3,000 asylum seekers had left Israel for a third country. But the BBC has learned that only seven have registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Rwanda, all of them Eritreans, and only eight, mostly from Sudan, in Uganda.\n\nMeanwhile, there are about 45,000 Eritreans and Sudanese in Israel. The government won't deport them - that would be a clear breach of the UN Refugee Convention, which it signed in 1954. Under the Convention, no-one can be forcibly returned to a country where they have a justified fear of persecution. \n\nBut if Israel treats them as refugees at least in this respect, why does it then refuse them asylum?\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon says the migrants threaten the security, and the identity, of the Jewish state.\n\n\"It's obvious that we live here in a situation which is rather complex and complicated. And if you add this element of migrants who come here and who want to stay here - undoubtedly because this is a rich and prosperous country - then it could become also a challenge to our identity here in Israel.\n\n\"It's not only about the 45,000 or 50,000 people that already are here in Israel, it's about the potential. Because those people tell their friends and families back home -'Look, this is a very nice place. Do come over.'\"\n\nAnd, of course, in Israel there is also the ever present issue of security.\n\n\"Open borders through which migrants can pass mean also open borders through which terror organisations can penetrate Israeli territory and commit terror acts,\"Nahshon says.\n\nBut lawyers fighting against the Third Country policy in Israel's Supreme Court argue that the country is in breach of its obligations under the UN Refugee Convention.\n\n\"[Migrants] are stigmatised as'infiltrators' and then have their asylum application adjudicated in sort of a conveyor-belt system which rejects everyone,\"says one of the lawyers, Anat Ben-Dor.\n\n\"And then the whole idea of asking them to give their'voluntary' consent to something they do not know because this is a secret arrangement... Of course this is not voluntary because you are using the threat of putting them indefinitely in prison if they refuse to go.\n\n\"And then when they land in one of those two countries the lack of proper monitoring cannot really secure, in the necessary certainty, that those people would not end up either without [legal] status, or in prison, or - worst of all - being returned to places where they would face danger.\"\n\nSigal Rozen, from the Israeli human rights group Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, says that the failure by Israel to guarantee the migrants' security in Rwanda and Uganda means they are forced to risk their lives elsewhere. \n\n\"Some of them continue to South Sudan, others to Kenya, to Ethiopia, and many end up in Europe after they take the route through Libya and Italy. Unfortunately many others die on the way and we never hear from them again,\"she says. \n\nThere's a joke among the migrants, she says, that the Israeli government's departing\"gift\"of $3,500 is just enough money to get to Europe.\n\nBut the Israeli government is adamant that it's acting within the framework of international law and is offering a fair deal to the migrants. \n\nBut in Tesfay's opinion, he did not get a fair deal.\n\n\"The Israeli authority - it's not what they promised. I have no safety - I have no protection at all,\"he says.\n\nThe risk is that Adam and the other residents of Holot will experience exactly the same thing when they arrive in Africa.\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: For nearly a year Israel has been offering African migrants cash and the chance to go and live in what is supposed to be a safe haven in a third country - but the BBC has spoken to two men who say that they were abandoned as soon as they got off the plane. One was immediately trafficked, the other left to fend for himself without papers.\n\nArticle: His 25-year partnership with David Croft also produced It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord?\n\nMuch of his writing was based on his own varied work experiences which included a spell as a Butlin's Redcoat.\n\nHe also had an encyclopaedic knowledge of music hall, something he used to good effect when he presented the BBC series Turns, which chronicled variety performances from the 1930s and 40s.\n\nJimmy Perry was born on 20 September 1923 in Barnes, south-west London.\n\nHis fascination for the world of showbusiness came at an early age and, while still at school, he had his sights set on becoming a stand up-comedian.\n\nWhen war broke out in 1939 he was too young for the army so he signed up in his local Home Guard.\n\nIt was an experience on which he would later draw when he conceived Dad's Army, basing many of the characters on soldiers he met in the ranks.\n\nHe was called up in 1941 and sent to Burma where he became part of a Royal Artillery Concert Party, set up to entertain the troops.\n\nAfter the war he began training as an actor at Rada, subsidising his studies with spells as a Redcoat at Butlin's holiday camps.\n\nFor many years Perry ran the Palace Theatre at Watford as part of a small repertory company that produced a different show each week.\n\nReservations\n\nAmong the aspiring performers who appeared there was Ruth Llewellyn who would later become Ruth Madoc, the indomitable Gladys Pugh in Hi-de-Hi..\n\nIn the early 1960s he was playing a series of bit parts in TV comedy and began working on an idea for a sitcom about the Home Guard which he entitled The Fighting Tigers.\n\nPerry showed his idea to TV producer David Croft, who took it to the BBC's head of comedy, Michael Mills.\n\nThe BBC had some initial reservations that the programme might be seen to be poking fun at the Home Guard, but Mills was persuaded to commission the first series.\n\nMills changed the title to Dad's Army, renamed some of the characters and altered the fictional location to Walmington-on-Sea.\n\nPerry himself had envisaged playing the spiv, Private Walker, but David Croft, who was drafted in to help Perry with the scripts, advised against it.\n\nMany of Perry's characters in Dad's Army were taken from real life. One elderly soldier of his acquaintance recalled serving under Kitchener and became the inspiration for Corporal Jones.\n\nLyrics\n\nPrivate Pike was based on Perry himself, who recalled his mother's anxiety over her teenage son being out at night in the cold, defending the country. \n\n\"She didn't go so far as making me wear a scarf,\"Perry later recalled.\"But she came pretty near.\"\n\nDad's Army first aired on 31 July 1968, with a total of 80 episodes appearing over the following nine years.\n\nSince then it has rarely been off the screen thanks to a series of repeats.\n\nAs well as co-writing the script, Perry wrote the lyrics for the opening song, Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Mr Hitler, which he persuaded his great music hall idol, Bud Flanagan, to perform.\n\nThe song won the 1971 Ivor Novello Award for Best TV Signature Tune.\n\nIn 1969 Perry went solo to write The Gnomes of Dulwich, a sitcom that satirised the Common Market.\n\nRoom Service\n\nStarring Terry Scott and Hugh Lloyd as concrete British gnomes threatened by their plastic European counterparts, the show ran for just six episodes.\n\nDad's Army was still appearing regularly when Perry and Croft decided to draw on their wartime experiences in the Far East for It Ain't Half Hot Mum.\n\nThe show centred on a British army concert party whose duty was to entertain the front-line troops. A similar scenario appeared in the 1977 film, Privates on Parade.\n\nThe first episode was transmitted on 3 January 1974 and the series ran for more than seven years.\n\nIn 1979 Perry again went out on his own to write the ITV sitcom, Room Service. Together with a later effort without Croft, High Street Blues, it became a contender for the worst British sitcom ever.\n\nThe following year saw Perry and Croft back together again for Hi-de-Hi, based on Perry's experiences at Butlin's.\n\nSet in a 1950s holiday camp, the series ran for eight years and collected a Bafta in 1984 for Best Comedy Series. Perry wrote the theme tune, Holiday Rock.\n\nMemorable\n\nThe series spawned a musical featuring most of the TV cast, which ran in Bournemouth, London and Blackpool in 1983 and 1984.\n\nPerry's final collaboration with David Croft came with You Rang M'Lord?, which turned out to be their least successful effort.\n\nOnce again Perry based the idea on reality, this time the experiences of his grandfather who had been a butler in a large household.\n\nUnusually for a sitcom, the episodes were 50 minutes in length and featured high production values. Despite this, it was not well received by critics, although it ran for 26 episodes.\n\nIn 2003 Perry and Croft received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the British Comedy Awards. \n\nThe release of a film version of Dad's Army in 2016 divided fans of the series but Perry gave it his blessing by attending the premiere in London.\n\nJimmy Perry was half of one of the most successful writing partnerships in TV comedy. In his memoir, Stupid Boy, he chronicled some of the real-life individuals on which he based  the likes of Captain Mainwaring, Corporal Jones, Gladys Pugh and the fearsome Sgt Major Williams.\n\n While Croft brought his experience as a producer and director it was Perry's great observational skills which peopled their work with such memorable characters.\n\nWhat are your memories of Jimmy Perry?

The restaurant - the Holey Artisan Bakery and O'Kitchen in Gulshan, Dhaka's leafiest, most exclusive area - was filling up, mostly with Japanese and Italian customers.  \n\nSuddenly, the five young militants burst in shooting and began hacking at the diners with sharp weapons. \n\nShishir Sarker, one of the Holey Artisan's chefs, was coming out of the refrigerated chiller room with a plate of pasta when he heard shouting.\n\n\"Then I saw one of the attackers - in one hand he had a sword or machete, and a gun was slung across his chest,\"Sarker recalls. \n\nAs a Hindu, he had good reason to be afraid - if the Islamist militants found out his religion, it would be a death sentence. \n\n\"At that moment, a Japanese man shouted to me:'Help me!',\"he says.\"I turned and went back inside the chiller, and helped him in too.\"\n\nThere was no latch to lock the chiller from the inside, so the two men pulled on the door to keep it shut. \n\n\"The Japanese guy asked me who those men were. I said I didn't know, but don't worry, the police are coming.\"  \n\nFor nearly two hours the men stayed quietly inside.  \n\n\"It was really cold. We did some exercise to try and keep warm - sit-ups holding the door pulled shut,\"Sarker says.  \n\nFind out more\n\nThen came a terrifying moment - one of the attackers tried to open the chiller door.  \n\n\"We held on to it very hard and he failed. He went away, but now they knew someone was inside.\" \n\nAnd 10 or 15 minutes later the militant came back.  \n\n\"We were so cold, we were losing our strength,\"Sarker says. The attacker hauled the door open.  \n\n\"He told me to come out. I was so frightened I immediately fell on to the ground and lay there. I thought if I was standing, he might chop me with his machete. I was repeatedly saying:'For Allah's sake, don't kill me.'\"\n\nAssuming he was Muslim, and therefore not a target, the gunman told him to go and join his colleagues on the other side of the restaurant.  \n\n\"I crawled on my hands and knees over dead bodies and blood. Then suddenly I heard two shots. The Japanese man with me in the chiller was dead.\" \n\nSarker sat at a table with other members of staff, all of them with their heads down. After 02:00, one of the militants asked who the chef was. His colleagues pointed at Sarker. He was taken to the kitchen.  \n\n\"They asked me what food we had - if we had sea bass and shrimps. I said, yes we had. They told me to fry it, and decorate it nicely on a plate.\"\n\nWhile Sarker was cooking, one of the militants came into the kitchen.  \n\n\"He asked me what my name was.  I just said my name was Shishir - I didn't tell him my second name because that would have revealed that I'm Hindu.\" \n\nPerhaps the militant was suspicious. He asked Sarker to recite from the Koran. \n\nSarker calmly carried on frying sea bass. And he recited Koranic verses.  \n\n\"All my life I've had Muslim friends, so I knew some Surah [chapters of the Koran]. But I was so frightened. I was thinking - would I satisfy him?\"   \n\nIn keeping with Islamic tradition during Ramadan, the food was served before dawn to the Muslim hostages and to the staff.  \n\n\"I was so scared, when I ate I couldn't swallow the food. But I thought if I didn't eat, they would think I wasn't going to fast the following day, and then they would guess I wasn't Muslim,\"says Sarker.    \n\nSoon after sunrise, Operation Thunderbolt - a commando-led assault with armoured personnel carriers - ended the siege. The five militants lay dead. Sarker and his surviving colleagues were rescued. \n\nLife will never be the same for this unassuming young chef.  He is working again, but still traumatised by that hellish night.  \n\n\"I don't see any future.  I can't sleep properly.  Whenever I'm alone and I think of that night, I just can't do anything - I feel terrified.\"   \n\nThe student who refused to abandon his friends\n\nFaraaz Ayaaz Hossain, a 20-year-old studying at a university in the US, was home in Dhaka for the holidays. \n\nHe had arranged to meet two old school friends at the Holey Artisan that night - Abinta Kabir, a US citizen from a Bangladeshi family studying at the same university, and Tarishi Jain, who was Indian, a Hindu and a student in California.  \n\nHossain and the young women had just taken their seats in the restaurant when the attack began. A family driver called his mother and told her something was amiss.         \n\n\"As soon as my mum heard, she barged into my room and said,'I'm going',\"says Faraaz's brother Zaraif.\"She put on her shawl, took her phone, and ran - I ran behind her.  \n\n\"When we got there people started telling us they'd heard the assailants shouting:'Allahu Akbar!' That's when it hit us this must be more serious than an armed robbery or something.\" \n\nAfter 21:30, some 45 minutes after the attack had begun, a number of the restaurant staff managed to escape via the roof. They appeared on the street, and Zaraif and his mother homed in on one of the waiters.     \n\n\"We asked,'Have you seen a boy with two girls?' We were showing a picture of Faraaz on our phones. And he said,'I've seen them, they're hiding under a table.'\" \n\nBut other details were chilling.\n\nThe waiter said everyone who was foreign was being kept in one section. And everyone who was considered Bangladeshi and Muslim was put into another section.\n\n\"At that moment my mother turned to me and said:'Tarishi and Abinta won't be let go. I'm so scared, because I know my son - I know Faraaz, and he's not going to leave his friends.'\"    \n\nWhen the siege ended, Faraaz and both his friends were dead - murdered by the militants. And an incredible account emerged of Faraaz's last moments, validating his mother's fears.     \n\n\"So what we heard about what transpired was that, well\u2026 Faraaz was a Bangladeshi and a Muslim and therefore, logically, he would have been let go by the terrorists,\"says his brother.  \n\n\"But when he was told to leave, Faraaz said:'What about my friends?' And when they were denied freedom, he said:'I'm not leaving them.'\" \n\nThe story of Faraaz's selfless act has brought international recognition, including the Mother Theresa Memorial International Award for Social Justice, which was conferred posthumously on this bright young man.   \n\nIn Bangladesh too, he has been celebrated. \n\n\"In remote places, people are having discussion meetings saying:'Faraaz is Bangladesh, this is who we are - not the terrorists,'\"says Faraaz's grandfather, the industrialist, Latifur Rahman.  \n\n\"In Banshkhali, they named a square after him. The other day a professor at one of our universities gave birth to a boy and named him Faraaz - because, she said, she wanted him to have the same values as Faraaz.\"\n\nThis is heartening for the family. But it cannot replace the mad-keen Manchester United fan - a young man destined, says his grandfather, for leadership and success.  \n\n\"I struggle with it every day. I understand what he did, I deeply admire what he did, but I struggle with understanding how one could do that.  I struggle because I don't have the guts.  I don't have the strength to do what this young boy did.  I wish he was here with me.\"  \n\nThe mystery of the lost cook\n\nZakir Hossain Shaon's family home on the southern outskirts of Dhaka feels like a million miles from the upmarket restaurant where he was employed. Down a track that skirts a pond covered in water hyacinth, his parents, brothers and sister live in a tiny one-room house with an adjoining kitchen.  \n\nShaon, 18, had worked at the Holey Artisan for about a year.  \n\n\"He adapted quickly to that job and his cooking duties,\"says his father, Abdus Sattar.  \n\n\"All his colleagues loved him because he was the youngest,\"says Zakir's mother, Maksuda Begum.\n\nOn the evening of 1 July, Shaon was at work. He called his mother and told her he had been paid an Eid bonus, and would be coming home the next day, or the day after.  \n\nIt was many hours before his parents found out about the attack - as it was the month of Ramadan, they were not watching television that evening.  \n\nIn the morning, they were told about it by neighbours, and headed to Gulshan with Shaon's picture. They went from one police officer to another showing their son's photo. They talked to countless people on the streets. No-one knew anything.   \n\nAt 22:00 that night, Sattar was in Gulshan police station. He says an officer there told him his son was alive, but that he could not say where he was.    \n\nMeanwhile, on local TV, pictures of Shaon were shown. They were taken sometime before 03:00 on 2 July, while the militants were still inside the Holey Artisan. \n\nIn them, Shaon is sitting in the back of a police vehicle, officers holding his arms. He is bleeding from the chest, but he is clearly conscious. \n\nSomehow he had escaped the siege. So where was he now? \n\nOn the morning of 3 July, Shaon's parents got a call from a surviving member of the Holey Artisan's staff. He told them their son was in Dhaka Medical College Hospital.  \n\nThey rushed to see him. It was deeply distressing. He looked as though he had been beaten. There were marks on his legs, and he had a black eye which was not there on the TV pictures. He slipped in and out of consciousness.     \n\n\"Every time he came to his senses he said one thing -'Don't hit me please, don't beat me any more. Let me go,'\"remembers his mother.    \n\n\"The police grabbed him, and they tortured him. They hit him on the head. They kicked him. They indiscriminately beat him,\"she claims.   \n\nThe chief of counter-terrorism for Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Monirul Islam, says Shaon was not in police custody.\n\n\"He was injured while he was trying to escape [from the restaurant].  He was taken to the hospital after Holey Bakery incident, at midnight I think. We are not sure who took whom to the hospital.\"    \n\nDhaka Medical College Hospital can find no record of admitting Shaon, so the date and time he arrived cannot be confirmed.  \n\nHis father tried to make a complaint to the police.\"They didn't pay any heed to it,\"he says. \n\nShaon died on 8 July - a week after the siege. His family are still looking for answers. \n\nOn 11 January, the Holey Artisan Bakery reopened, albeit in a different location. The previous Friday, Dhaka police said one of the alleged masterminds of the siege had been shot dead. The shockwaves from the attack continue to reverberate across Bangladesh.\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.\nTL;DR: When five armed Islamist militants stormed a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 1 July 2016, 29 people lost their lives. Emerging from the appalling, bloody debris are stories of immense courage. There are also unanswered questions about what happened to some of those who died.\n\nArticle: By Ben TrusloveBBC News\n\nIf a building is industrial does that automatically disqualify it from being beautiful? In the classic children's comic Asterix and the Golden Sickle, the moustachioed hero decries the creation of the Pont du Gard, exclaiming\"the Romans are ruining the landscape with all these modern buildings!\".\n\nToday, it is one of the finest examples of Roman architecture and majestically frames the River Gardon in the south of France.\n\nCould coal-fired power station cooling towers, those curved chimneys that dominate landscapes across the UK, one day be considered 20th Century versions of the aqueduct?\n\n\"You might think of them as an ugly intrusion into the landscape but actually I quite like them. They have a simple elegant shape, really, I would be sad to see them go.\"\n\nThis is the verdict of Nottingham Civic Society's Hilary Sylvester on the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power plant. And she does not think she is alone.\n\n\"They provide a point in the landscape,\"she said.\"People probably did not want them when they were first built but they've been there for so long they are a feature.\n\n\"Putting a building in the landscape doesn't necessarily ruin it, and an industrial building doesn't have to be awful.\"\n\nThanks to its links with mining, Nottinghamshire has three of the largest coal-fired power stations in the UK - Cottam and West Burton, near Retford, both in the north of the county, and Ratcliffe-on-Soar close to the border with Derbyshire and Leicestershire. And it used to have more.\n\nBut like Nottinghamshire's coal-mining industry, they face being consigned to history's slag heap following Energy Secretary Amber Rudd's announcement last week.\n\nPower generation in the UK\n\nMs Rudd revealed coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology are to be closed down by 2025.\n\nEurope's largest coal-fired power station Drax,  in North Yorkshire, recently announced it is cancelling investment in the only scheme linked to a coal power station.\n\nIt is now clear the government favours gas over coal, but coal-fired power stations cannot be converted for this use.\n\nIndustry representative body Energy UK said it would be best to\"knock them down and start afresh\"- although with a ready-made connection to the National Grid it should prove easier to rebuild Britain's power stations where they stand rather than choose a new location.\n\nAll of which points to an extremely uncertain future for cooling towers, those vast symbols of industry to which many people have perhaps surprisingly become rather attached.\n\nTheir towering forms, visible for miles around, are the signal to many commuters they have nearly reached the comforts of home.\n\nIn Sheffield, the since-demolished Tinsley cooling towers were such an integral part of the city's backdrop they were emblazoned on promotional T-shirts, and so fond was one woman of Didcot power station in Oxfordshire she had it tattooed on her leg.\n\nClare Price from the Twentieth Century Society - which campaigns to preserve post-1914 British architecture  - went as far as to say cooling towers were like modern versions of the church tower - that familiar landmark that means you are home.\n\nBut they are also an important part of British history.\n\n\"We think it's a real pity that we could lose the cooling towers. They have a fantastic sculptural form and are a striking feature of our landscape,\"Ms Price said.\n\n\"They are a very important part of our industrial history and are a part of our culture.\"\n\nSo could, or should, we prevent every cooling tower from being razed to the ground?\n\nNeville Stankley is an expert in heritage from Nottingham Trent University.\n\n\"We have lost almost all evidence of the mining industry in Nottinghamshire. The danger is the power stations will all be wiped away, almost as if they never existed. \n\n\"It will be interesting to see if anything is saved. At the moment you don't get the feeling there's an appetite for preservation, but then you take it for granted until all of a sudden it's under threat.\"\n\nBut what can be done with a redundant cooling tower? \n\nThe Twentieth Century Society suggested looking to Germany where alternative uses have been found, such as Wunderland Kalkar, a theme park inside a disused nuclear power plant.\n\nThis, though, would require a sizeable investment, but there is hope.\n\nNext month, Historic England is holding a conference with the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Prince's Regeneration Trust to explore ways of reusing industrial buildings.\n\nAnd Historic England says it is working with the power companies and National Grid to\"agree an appropriate conservation strategy\".\n\nMr Stankley would like to see some of the towers preserved - particularly in Nottinghamshire's Trent valley - but is not optimistic. \n\n\"It will be really interesting to see what happens. Maybe in 20 years' time people will be saying'let's go down to Ratcliffe for a great day out'. That would be fantastic - but I won't hold my breath.\"\n\nAround the BBC\n\nDidcot's cooling towers demolished\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nTwentieth Century Society\n\nNottingham Trent University\n\nHistoric England\nTL;DR: All coal-fired power stations will be closed by 2025, the government has announced, signalling the beginning of the end for their cooling towers.

Unmistakable, also, is the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on the planet for hundreds of years.\n\nJuno's goal over the next 18 months will be to try to understand what makes Jupiter tick.\n\nScientists plan to use the spacecraft's instruments to sense the planet's deep interior.

My father took to the bed with severe arthritis, so it never was feasible for us to do anything.\n\n'There were no finances'\n\n\"I didn't have the will, he didn't have the will to do it and there were no finances if we were very keen to do it so it just didn't come onto the radar.\"\n\nMargaret has lived alone in the family's 18th century thatched cottage since her father's death in 1980.\n\nLiving without modern amenities requires physical strength - she must cross a field to collect water in a bucket from a well up to 10 times a day and needs to stoop to cook over an open fire, which she lights every morning from a stack of turf and logs.\n\nHer daily routine begins at 05:30 BST when she heats water in a kettle over the fire for washing and tea - milk and perishables are stored in a wheelie bin. She keeps up-to-date with news on a wind-up radio.\n\nLamps decorate the thick stone windowsills of her tiny two-bedroom home, but paraffin is expensive so Margaret's schedule is governed by daylight - she is usually in bed by 18:30 BST.\n\n'People are entitled to live as they want'\n\nMargaret said her lifestyle meant she grew up with\"the seasons being the master of us all.\"\n\nShe recalled her father taking her outside as a child on Halloween night to gauge the wind direction.\n\nThe prevailing wind would, according to local lore, determine the severity of the winter ahead.\n\nShe loves summer and is less keen on winter when she uses a long fishing pole to push snow off her roof to prevent damage to the thatch.\n\nDespite the difficulties of a cold winter in a house without central heating, Margaret said the compensations of her life could not be overstated.\n\n\"You have the birds in the morning nesting in the house, you have the views, the tranquillity and peace, you have the clock ticking - all those things that you couldn't put a price on,\"she said.\n\n\"I am living the way my forefathers lived, who left the footprint for me. It was good enough for my people, for my parents, my grandparents, who bought the house in 1887 - it is a tribute to them.\"\n\n'I am not going to change for anyone'\n\nMargaret said visitors were often surprised that she does not fit the stereotype of an elderly woman living off-grid.\n\nThey expect to find her, she said,\"sitting in the corner wearing a long black dress and a white apron.\"\n\nInstead, if they take a peek in her bedroom, they will find this sprightly woman likes modern fashion - evident from her long ear rings and the red high-heeled shoes stored beside her bed, bought for the time she received an MBE for community work from the Prince of Wales.\n\n\"I don't know of anyone living like me, without electricity, without running water without any of the amenities. But then I am not interested in how people live. People are entitled to live as they want,\"she said.\n\n\"I am my own person, I have my own identity, this house embodies who I am and what I am. I am not going to change for anyone.\"\n\n'Absolutely no regrets'\n\nWhile she has\"absolutely no regrets\"about her life off-grid, Margaret realises her unusual lifestyle is disappearing.\n\n\"Everyone likes to come and look at this house but if you asked them to stay they couldn't wait to get out of it, particularly younger people,\"she said.\n\nYet, she believes young people could learn from the simplicity of her choices, instead of seeking\"everything big and shiny and better\". \n\nShe said her message to those starting out in life was to\"be aware of who they are and where they come from.

a first for any Scottish attraction. \n\nEdinburgh continued to dominate the marketplace, with 11 of the top 20 attractions located in the city. \n\nThe Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions (ASVA) looked at 232 sites with 77% reporting increased visits. \n\nIt is the fourth year running that an increase has been recorded with the latest figures on top of a 6% rise for attractions in 2016, which itself followed a 3.4% rise in 2015.\n\nSectors which fared particularly well in 2017 include castles and heritage sites (+14.7%), gardens (+13.6%), distilleries/whisky-related attractions (+11.8%) and museums and galleries (+7.5%). \n\nAttractions in the vicinity of Loch Ness, including the medieval fortress of Urquhart Castle and the Loch Ness by Jacobite scenic cruises, continued to demonstrate above average growth.\n\nBoth attractions received a boost of 30,000 visitors per year, thanks to a partnership with a tour operator specialising in the Chinese market.  \n\nThe\"Outlander\"effect continued to benefit many sites featuring in the cult TV series, as well as others with Jacobite connections.  \n\nLarge increases in visitor numbers were recorded at attractions including Culloden Battlefield Visitor Centre (+ 28%), Glasgow Cathedral (+31%), Castle Fraser (+49%) and Glenfinnan Monument (+58%).\n\nMalcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive, said:\"Scotland's visitor attractions are a valuable part of our country's outstanding tourism offering, showcasing our rich history and sharing Scotland's story with visitors from far and wide. \n\n\"The continued impact of the Outlander effect and the growing popularity of whisky tourism are also positioning Scotland as an unmissable destination for film and food and drink experiences.\"\n\nThe National Museum of Scotland welcomed the most visitors while Edinburgh Castle retained its status as the most popular paid attraction.\n\nDr Gordon Rintoul, Director of National Museums Scotland said:\"It is terrific news that the latest ASVA visitor figures have confirmed that the National Museum of Scotland is again the most popular visitor attraction in Scotland.\n\n\"In 2017 we welcomed almost 2.2 million visitors -

BitMitigate's website says it has\"a proven commitment to liberty\". \n\nBitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017.\n\nThe BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline.\n\nCloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. \n\nHowever, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post that\"8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate\u201d. \n\n\u201cThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,\u201d Mr Prince wrote.  \n\n\"Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.\u201d \n\nMr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflare\u2019s decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. \n\n\u201cThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,\u201d Mr Prince wrote. \n\n\"That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process.\n\nHe added:\"I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. \n\n\"In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internet\u2019s.\u201d \n\nHow do Cloudflare and BitMitigate services work?\n\nThe two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users.\n\nThey can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks.\n\nThey use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. \n\nThey can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. \n\nThey are meant to block any attempts from\"bad\"traffic getting through.\n\nCloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year.\n\nChief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concern at the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. \n\n8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. \n\nMr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflare\u2019s announcement, he wrote on Twitter:\"Thank you so much @CloudFlare Finally this nightmare might have an end.\u201d \n\n8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines. \n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Maybe even an election. \n\nThe moment passed. There was a show of unity at the Cabinet. But you only need shows of unity when you are trying to manage dangerous divisions, and tensions over the final form of Brexit still lurk behind the fixed grins of ministers, as the prime minister's\"Brexit Means Brexit\"rubric wears thin. \n\nViewed against that backdrop Theresa May's Florence speech now looks crucial to the political stability of the Conservative Party. \n\nBecause the government is not just negotiating with the EU; it is negotiating with itself and, by extension, with its backbenchers, and with the broader constituencies of Leave and Remain voters outside Westminster. \n\n'Double-lock'\n\nIt is dealing with a spectrum of MPs ranging from those who see nothing to fear from simply walking away from the EU without any deal, to those who want to remain in the Single Market. And they can't all get what they want.\n\nIn the end the speech did not offer any quantum leaps to new negotiating positions.\n\nMrs May did repeat that no deal was better than a bad deal - although she emphasised her belief that a good deal was obtainable. So there was no snub to Conservatives who want that option maintained.\n\nAnd she called for a transitional arrangement of\"about\"two years during which most existing arrangements would be maintained, while a longer term deal was worked out. \n\nShe didn't like either the Norway or Canada models for a future deal, and thought something better was attainable. \n\nCrucially, she added there was a\"double lock\"time-limiting the deal, so that there would be no question of the UK lingering indefinitely in some EU half-life.\n\nBut the exact nature of that final destination is ultimately the most divisive question. \n\nBoris Johnson was quick to hail the speech as ruling out a\"Norway Option\"relationship with the EU. \n\nNigel Farage is already attacking the speech as a betrayal of Brexit and calling for Britain to leave now. \n\nHotel California\n\nSo far the prime minister has been careful not to over-specify her view, but the time for ambiguity is passing and she faces all kinds of policy choices, on immigration, continuing payments to the EU, future trade, and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. \n\nHer references to the UK's future as a global trading nation imply that she is not angling for some crypto remain settlement and that could salve Brexiteer anxieties. A bit. For now. \n\nThese are the points that I think will resonate with her MPs:\n\nMPs from all sides are out and about to comment on the speech and it will doubtless resound through the remainder of the conference season. \n\nData protection\n\nWhen Parliament returns there may be calls for the prime minister to deliver a statement to MPs, but otherwise, there are few obvious opportunities for them to make waves. \n\nThe key figures in the Cabinet's Brexit debate - Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond - are not, as it happens, due to take questions in the House on the first week back, apart, although Theresa May herself will have PMQs on the Wednesday. \n\nMPs are not due to debate the detail of the key piece of Brexit legislation, the EU (Withdrawal) Bill in that first week, but it is possible some speech related amendments might go down. \n\nIn the longer term, another key Brexit Bill, to set up a post-Brexit immigration system, could become a focus for backbench attention, following the prime minister's comments on the status of EU citizens in the UK. \n\nAnd peers will soon get their teeth into the new Data Protection Bill, dealing with a key issue both for the security relationship the prime minister envisages and for businesses sharing information with EU countries. \n\nThis is the kind of highly technical measure that governments often launch in the Lords rather than the Commons, but it's debate could now be tinged with Brexit tensions. \n\n'Continuity Cameron'\n\nWith no detailed glimpse of a final destination offered in Florence, one question is whether Brexiteer unity will crack. \n\nTheir key umbrella group was the ERG, the European Research Group. Under the leadership of Steve\"Rebel Commander\"Baker, it was the nerve centre of a long running operation to push for the Referendum. \n\nMr Baker is now a Brexit minister - but therein lies the tale, because he replaced the former Cabinet Minister David Jones in that job, in a move which seems to have stirred suspicions among the core-Brexiteers. \n\nSome seem to have migrated to another group, Leave Means Leave, and claim to detect a whiff of establishment compromise in the ERG camp.  \n\nAnd meanwhile, between the Brexiteers and the Remainers, a third category of Tory MP has emerged. They are less concerned with the detail of the Brexit deal and more about keeping the Conservative show on the road.\n\nBack in the early'90s, in the Maastricht era, the then foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, warned the Conservative conference that the party could break itself for a generation over Europe; and it did. \n\nThe EU issue has ended the careers of the last three Conservative prime ministers, so Conservative MPs don't underestimate its continuing ability to wreak havoc upon them.\n\n What is now emerging is a kind of\"Continuity Cameroon\"faction, a self-styled mainstream, that wants to keep the Conservatives - be they Leave or Remain - together and in government. \n\nThe alternative to rallying round whatever Theresa May can deliver, they fear, is an early election and Jeremy Corbyn in No 10.\n\nOne gloomy Brexiteer suggested to me that the government will settle for a minimal form of Brexit, not that far from actual EU membership - carried by loyalists with Labour support, while he and a few allies voted, despairingly, against the deal.\n\nThe prime minister's choice of Florence as the venue for this speech had many people remarking that it was the city of Machiavelli, the political theorist who became a byword for cynical realpolitik; but it is also the city of Dante, the poet who put betrayers in the deepest circle of Hell, where the devil gnawed on the bodies of Judas, Cassius and Brutus - the great betrayers. \n\nWho might a future Dante see as the betrayers, and who as the keepers of the faith?\nTL;DR: Last weekend the government had a glimpse of how quickly it could break itself over Brexit.\n\nArticle: Loteri Cymru praised its\"growing base of loyal weekly players\"but said it was not enough to make the venture financially viable.\n\nThe directors have filed a notice of intention in court to put the company into administration.\n\nDuring their operating period on S4C they distributed \u00a3120,000 to charitable causes in Wales and over \u00a3350,000 in prize money, with a jackpot of \u00a325,000.\n\nLoteri Cymru has not confirmed what will happen to funds that remain in players' accounts, and said it hopes to make a\"positive statement on the website\"following the appointment of an administrator.\n\nThe lottery announced it is in discussions with\"several interested parties\"and is\"hopeful that the business can be sold\".\nTL;DR: Wales' televised lottery has ceased operating after 11 months.\n\nArticle: The 26-year-old, from Rutland, was forced to abandon her attempt to become the first woman to row from Japan to Canada when she hit bad weather.\n\nAfter arriving in Japan on Sunday, she told the BBC she had feared for her life in the\"horrific conditions\".\n\n\"It's been a bit surreal in some ways to be back on land so soon,\"she said.\n\nShe added:\"I'm pretty exhausted at the moment, physically and emotionally, after everything that's happened in the last few days, but I'm happy to be safe and grateful to everybody who was able to coordinate the pick-up.\"\n\nMs Outen was dehydrated when she arrived in Japan and spent some time in hospital on an intravenous drip before heading to a friend's house. \n\nBoat'a plaything'\n\nShe was bidding to become the first woman to row 4,500 miles (7,250km) from Japan to Canada when her boat, Gulliver, was damaged by high waves during a tropical storm.\n\n\"You only ever make that call, the distress call, if you fear for your life,\"she said. \n\n\"Ultimately the condition had caused such damage to the boat that it wasn't safe to carry on.\n\n\"The waiting was challenging in that the conditions were still very severe.

Many were about digital literacy, which is not going set people up for progression in computing beyond the age of 16.\"\n\nThe academy has  \n          \n \n          prepared a guide\n, breaking down the qualifications now recognised by government into three distinct categories - digital literacy, IT and computer science - to help schools decide which ones to offer.\n        \n\nMs Dawkins says a narrow computer-science-based curriculum could have unintended consequences.\n\n\"As a result of the government's new policy, there is a question mark over which exams are acceptable,\"she said.\n\n\"Now government wants us to go down a more academic route, it has narrowed down the qualifications that are recognised, which may mean we get even less people choosing it.\"\n\nThe Department for Education is clear that schools must take the initiative when it comes to teaching ICT.\n\n\"The current ICT curriculum is weak and outdated,\"a spokeswoman told the BBC.\n\n\"We must give teachers freedom over what and how to teach - so pupils can access up-to-date and relevant ICT and computer science resources, rather than an invalid and prescriptive curriculum.\"\n\nThe government was\"expecting schools to take the lead and come up with innovative ways to teach ICT,\"she added.\n\nGoogle teachers\n\nSome believe the debate about the state of ICT teaching in the UK was kick-started by Google chairman Eric Schmidt who, in a speech last August, said the UK was throwing away its computing heritage and lacked trained specialists.\n\nComputer science education, he said, was in a\"sorry state\".\n\nIn May, Google unveiled a plan to invest in computer science teachers via the Teach First charity, which puts\"exceptional\"graduates on a six-week training programme before deploying them to schools where they teach for a two-year period. It aims to train 100 such graduates over the next three years.\n\nEach will have a bursary to buy equipment, such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino computer kits.\n\nPartnerships with industry are just one of many innovative ways that ICT can be taught, according to Prof Harrison.\n\n\"You can bring in volunteers from industry to buddy with teachers,\"he said.\n\n\"We have already seen that happen in design and technology, where engineers were deployed alongside teachers.\"\n\nICT, he says, needs a campaign similar to the London Evening Standard newspaper's recent literacy campaign, which called for volunteers to spend an hour a week in classrooms helping primary school children learn to read.\n\nThere is also a lot of scope for crowd-sourcing expertise. Computing At Schools is a grass-roots group that aims to share expertise among like-minded teachers.\n\nBut these are only short-term quick fixes and a more long-term vision is also necessary, according to Prof Harrison. \n\n\"If, like I do, you believe that computing is vital component of the UK economy going forward then you have to invest and plan for it,\"he said.\n\n\"You have to recruit specialists and deploy them widely in schools. Computing needs to be seen as an important part of the education landscape, on a par with maths and physics.\"\nTL;DR: As the schools in England close for the summer holidays, the planning of lessons in September is probably not top of teachers' to-do lists.\n\nArticle: Experts from King's College London combined the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and a particulate matter known as PM2.5 to look at the total impact on the city's health in 2010.\n\nThe scientists said combining the pollutants\"reveal a higher health impact than previously estimated\".\n\nBoris Johnson said the report proved that\"bold measures\"were needed.  \n\nThe researchers, believed to be the first to combine the two pollutants, found that in 2010 there was the equivalent of 5,900 deaths associated with NO2 long term exposure and 3,500 deaths as a result of long-term exposure to PM2.5.\n\nThe total amounted to 9,400 deaths, although it was noted those affected by PM2.5 had decreased from 4,300 in 2008. \n\nThe study also found that nearly half of those affected by air pollution had been the result of pollutants being brought into the city via diesel fumes or industrial emissions transported from the European continent.  \n\nMayor of London Mr Johnson said:\"I've been criticised for cleaning up taxis, upgrading bus fleets and my plans for the world's first Ultra-Low Emission Zone in 2020, but this study shows imperatively why these bold measures are required.\"\n\nThe scientists said they believed that figures would\"decrease significantly\"in the future.\n\nWendy Mead, of the City of London Corporation, said:\"There is a strong desire from City businesses and residents to see a major improvement in London's air quality and green infrastructure.\"\n\nOn Tuesday the London Assembly called for plans to phase out the use of diesel vehicles in London after it was found the fuel accounted for 40% of the capital's air pollution.\nTL;DR: Nearly 10,000 people died in a year as a result of air pollution in London,  a study has found .\n\nArticle: Fergus WalshMedical correspondent\n\nA Danish man received the hand, which was connected to nerves in his upper arm, following surgery in Italy. \n\nDennis Aabo, who lost his left hand in a firework accident nearly a decade ago, said the hand was\"amazing\".  \n\nIn laboratory tests he was able to tell the shape and stiffness of objects he picked up, even when blindfolded.    \n\nThe details were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\nImplant\n\nAn international team carried out the research project, which included neuroscientists, engineers, surgeons and robotics experts from Italy, Switzerland and Germany.  \n\n\"It is the first time that an amputee has had real-time touch sensation from a prosthetic device\"said Prof Silvestro Micera, neuro-engineer, from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne and Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa.\n\nThe scientific advance here was not the hand itself, but the electronics and software that enabled it to give sensory feedback to the brain. \n\nMicera and his team added sensors to the artificial hand which could detect and measure information about touch.   Using computer algorithms, the scientists transformed the electrical signals they emitted into an impulse that sensory nerves could interpret.    \n\nDuring an operation in Rome, four electrodes were implanted onto nerves in the patient's upper arm.   These were connected to the artificial sensors in the fingers of the prosthetic hand, so allowing touch and pressure feedback to be sent direct to the brain.\n\nMr Aabo, 36, a property developer, spent a month doing laboratory tests, firstly to check the electrodes were functioning, and then with these fully connected to the bionic hand.    \n\nHe said:\"The biggest difference was when I grabbed something I could feel what I was doing without having to look.  I could use the hand in the dark.  \n\n\"It was intuitive to use, and incredible to be able to feel whether objects were soft or hard, square or round.\"\n\nHero\n\nThe bionic hand is still a prototype, and due to safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials, Mr Aabo required a second operation to remove the sensors. \n\n\"He is a hero,\" said Professor Paolo Rossini, neurologist, University Hospital Agostino Gemelli, Rome.\n\n\"He gave a month of his life and had two operations to test this device.\n\n\"We are all very grateful to him.\"\n\nProf Rossini said a lot of pre-training was done involving surgery on pigs, and with human cadavers, to ensure they knew exactly how to attach electrodes to the tiny peripheral nerves in the upper arm.  \n\nAnother member of the team, Dr Stanisa Raspopovic said: \"It was a very exciting moment when after endless hours of testing....Dennis turned to us and said with disbelief,'This is magic! I can feel the closing of my missing hand!'\"\n\nThose working in the field in the UK were also enthusiastic.\n\n\"This is very interesting work, taking research in upper limb prosthetics into the next stage by adding sensory feedback,  said Dr Alastair Ritchie, Lecturer in Biomaterials and Bioengineering, University of Nottingham.\n\n\"This technology would enable the user to know how firmly they are gripping an object, which is vital for handling fragile objects - imagine picking up an egg without any feeling in your fingers.\"\n\nThe international team is now working on how to miniaturise the technology so that it could be used in the home.\n\n\"We must get rid of the external cables and make them fully implantable\"said Prof Thomas Stieglitz, University of Frieburg, Germany, whose laboratory created the ultra-thin implantable electrodes.\n\nRecently, scientists in Cleveland, Ohio released a video of a patient using the fingers of a prosthetic hand to pull the stalks from cherries while blindfolded.  But the research has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. \n\nThere is no precise timetable, but scientists think it could be a decade before a sensory feedback bionic hand is commercially available.  \n\nAnd they believe it may pave the way for more realistic prosthetic devices in the future which can detect texture and temperature.   \n\n'Bring it on'\n\nBut it will undoubtedly be very expensive, well beyond the means of most patients.  And artificial hands still lack the precision and dexterity of the real thing. \n\nThe super-functioning bionic hand of science fiction films remains the stuff of fiction.  \n\nNonetheless, Dennis Aabo, who now has his old prosthesis back,  is ready to swap it for the bionic hand in any future trial. \n\n\"If they offer it to me, I will say bring it on, I'm ready.\"\nTL;DR: Scientists have created a bionic hand which allows the amputee to feel lifelike sensations from their fingers.\n\nArticle: Donington Collection Museum has rare, vintage and modern cars including Ferrari, BRM, Lotus, Mercedes-Benz, McLaren and Williams models. \n\nIts owner said the\"really difficult decision\"was taken due to\"family responsibilities\".\n\nThe museum, based at the Donington Park racetrack in Leicestershire, will close on 5 November.\n\nOwner Kevin Wheatcroft has been running the museum since his father died in 2009.\n\nHe said:\"Closing the museum after 45 years has been a really difficult decision, but family responsibilities simply make it the right thing to do.\"\n\nFrederick Bernard\"Tom\"Wheatcroft, who made his fortune from his building business, opened the museum in 1973. \n\nIn 1964, he bought a 13-year-old Formula 1 Ferrari single-seater racing car\"just for fun - and I caught the collecting bug\".\n\nOver the following six years, he acquired more historic Formula 1 machines and kept the cars at his Leicester home.\n\nThe collection includes:\n\nIn 1971, the motor sports enthusiast bought the circuit section of Donington Park and built the museum for his fleet of racing cars.\n\nMore of the world's finest cars were later brought or loaned to the collection.\n\nOver 45 years, more than 2.5m people have visited the attraction.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

Police, along with Warrington Borough Council and Mr and Mrs Parry, then decided restorative justice would have the best outcome for all those involved.\n\nThe restorative justice process brings together those who have committed offences and their victims.\n\nThe 29-year-old has offered to raise money for the Tim Parry Jonathan Ball Foundation For Peace through a sponsored event, and the 59-year-old will carry out four days of voluntary work to support the Warrington community. \n\nBoth men met councillors Terry O\u2032Neill and Mike Hannon of Warrington Borough Council, Mr and Mrs Parry and Ch Supt Richard Strachan from Cheshire Police. \n\nMr and Mrs Parry said they valued the opportunity to meet the two men involved in the theft.\n\nThey said:\"It enabled us to express in very frank terms just how disappointed and saddened we were by their thoughtless acts, especially as they both live locally.\n\n\"Both displayed remorse and regret for their actions and accepted with good grace the community-based punishment suggested by ourselves and supported by the councillors present. \n\n\"We were able to inform them of the importance of the work of our foundation and to help them appreciate that we need support and not mindless acts of vandalism if we are to continue to build the good reputation of the town and its residents. \n\n\"Today we witnessed restorative justice in action and we feel it was the most appropriate course of action available to us taking account of all those involved and affected.\"\n\nCh Supt Strachan said restorative justice allows offenders to talk about what they have done and why they did it.\n\n\"This has been a challenging experience for the two men involved,\"he said. \n\n\"They have had to sit and listen to those who have been directly affected by the choices they made that night in Warrington town centre when the plaque was pulled off its wall fixings and then stolen.\"\n\nThe plaque formed part of the River of Life memorial on Bridge Street in Warrington, which was opened by the Duchess of Kent in 1996.\n\nIt was stolen sometime between 20 April and 5 May and its disappearance was noted by a council employee.\nTL;DR: The parents of IRA bomb victim Tim Parry have met the two men involved in stealing a memorial to him from Warrington town centre.\n\nArticle: In north Devon, the A39 has been closed at Upcott, affecting traffic between Barnstaple and Kentisbury Ford. \n\nThe A399 has been blocked at Brayford by a fallen tree at Shutscombe Hill. Highways officials said they cleared a landslip on the A386 near Beam House.\n\nA fallen tree blocked a road at Holme Bridge, near Ashburton. In Plymouth, flooding closed Wolseley Road at the Barne Road junction.\n\nTwelve flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency for rivers including the Dart, the Plym, the Otter, the Sid, the Axe and the Torridge. \n\nThe Met Office has predicted 20mm of rain across the county on Sunday, and up to 45mm in some places. \n\nThe Environment Agency said people should be prepared for possible flooding as the ground in many areas was already saturated.\n\nHowever, it said roads and low-lying areas were most likely to be affected, and any flooding was not expected to be widespread.\nTL;DR: Areas across Devon have been affected by stormy weather and heavy rain. \n\n\n\nArticle: By Iolo ap DafyddBBC Wales environment correspondent\n\nThose are some of the comments made as BBC Wales filmed a Taro Naw programme for S4C about the impact of energy developments such as wind farms and potentially 30 miles of pylons and power lines in mid Wales.\n\nPlans to build 23 new wind farms and an infrastructure of pylons to support them are in danger of ripping some Montgomeryshire communities apart, say those who support the developments. \n\nTaro Naw has spoken to several farmers and members of communities across Powys who say that the actions of protesters make them feel intimidated and afraid to attend meetings to voice their support for wind farms publicly.\n\nSome local people are worried this ill-feeling will leave a long-term scar on communities.\n\n\"To put it simply - we feel intimidated. There's public confrontation in these meetings - and I can do without that in my life,\"said one farmer from Montgomeryshire, who appears in the programme anonymously. \n\n\"If you're not totally against wind power then people think you're bonkers. \n\n\"We're scared to support any kind of alternative energy openly. I had a terrible experience at a public meeting in Meifod recently,\"says former head teacher Buddug Bates, from near Llanfaircaereinion. \n\nMrs Bates and her husband, the former AM Mick Bates, both support wind energy. \n\nThere are 23 applications for new wind farms in mid Wales. Currently, there are seven operational wind sites with 267 turbines on them already. \n\nIf all the new developments are built, there would be almost 800 new turbines - most are likely to be taller and bigger than the existing turbines. \n\nThis controversy started some 19 months ago when National Grid - which is legally obliged to carry electricity to where it is needed in Britain - published its consultation plans for a large power substation and 30 miles of pylons to be built in Montgomeryshire and Shropshire.\n\nDuring May last year, 1,500 protesters gathered outside the Senedd in Cardiff Bay. \n\nGroups such as Montgomeryshire Against Pylons have been active in battling the energy plans ever since. Its chair, dairy farmer Jonathan Wilkinson from Meifod, says direct action, as a last resort, cannot be ruled out.\n\nHe said:\"If we fail in our ability to stop National Grid and stop this development then I'm pretty sure that public feeling is so strong that people will feel they have no other form of action.\"\n\nThe policy blamed by many is TAN 8. TAN stands for Technical Advice Note, and it's a planning document written by the Welsh government when First Minister Carwyn Jones was the environment minister in 2005. \n\nTAN 8 established seven strategic areas thought to be suitable as sites for developing wind energy on a large scale. Three of those areas are in mid Wales. \n\nMr Jones declined to be interviewed for the programme.\n\nTaro Naw also spoke to several former planning officers who were part of the consultation in 2005 and several pointed out the flaws of the policy, especially in transport, connecting wind farms to the grid and environmental impacts.\n\nOne former planning officer said many felt there was a lack of consultation by the Welsh government during the writing of TAN 8. \n\nIwan Evans, a former planning officer with Gwynedd council, remembered the Welsh government pushing it through at speed.\n\n\"There was consultation, but I'm not sure how much notice was given to comments made during consultation. The final version of TAN 8 wasn't very different to the draft version,\"said Mr Evans.\n\nPressure groups continue to oppose developments in Powys. \n\nMeanwhile, those who support them fear their anger will have a long lasting effect on communities across the county.\nTL;DR: Tension, intimidation, and local jealousies.\n\nArticle: David Cretney, Minister for Community, Culture and Leisure, said talks are continuing with union officials.\n\nBut he added:\"We don't have the money to keep stretching this out.\n\n\"First we were talking about 22 redundancies but we have now reached a situation where we have had to issue letter to six members of staff.\"\n\nHe added:\"That's not something I relish at all.\"\n\nA total of 230 people work in the department's transport division.\nTL;DR: The Isle of Man's leisure minister has said his department is trying hard to minimise the number of redundancies on the island's railways.\n\nArticle: It started with a raid by police on a cinema in one of the poorest districts of Beirut, following claims on a television show that it was a\"gay house\". \n\nThirty-six people were arrested. All of them were subjected to an examination by a doctor at a police station.\n\nThe scale of the operation, and the subsequent outcry, brought the issue of such tests to mainstream attention.\n\n\"It's the republic of shame,\"stated the opening line of a scathing introduction to the evening news bulletin on the privately-owned Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC).\n\nAnd the indignation was quick to spread. \n\nOn Facebook and Twitter and by email, many Lebanese shared clips from the introduction of the bulletin - an indication of the shock caused by the incident.\n\nFor the first time, it was not only gay-rights activists who were debating and condemning the practice but mainstream society. \n\n\"I'm not someone who supports gay rights but this is extremely disgraceful. What kind of country do we live in,\"one 40-year old woman said.\n\nMemorandum\n\nLebanon's Justice Minister, Shakib Qortbawi, was quick to take action.\n\n\"From a humanitarian point of view, this is totally unacceptable,\"he told the BBC.\n\n\"Immediately after I saw the TV report, I sent the prosecutor-general a letter asking for clarifications. And later on, the prosecutor-general issued himself a memorandum.\"\n\nThe memorandum is vaguely written but appears to call for restraint in the application of the tests.\n\nThe move was met with a great deal of scepticism by the country's gay community, which demands nothing less than a total ban of the tests. \n\nHelem, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) group, is stepping up the pressure and calling for a demonstration in protest against the tests.\n\n'Against nature'\n\nThere is no law that criminalises homosexuality in Lebanon. But people can be charged under Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code, which penalises\"sexual intercourse contrary to nature\"- specifically sexual intercourse that includes anal penetration - with a maximum of one year in prison.\n\nExamination results have been used as evidence to charge people with having illegal intercourse, despite the fact that many doctors who undertake the exams are not convinced at all that they hold any medical or scientific weight.\n\nDr Hussein Chahrour, head of the Lebanese Association for Forensic Science, has been conducting examinations since the 1990s. \n\nWithout hesitation he told the BBC:\"These tests prove absolutely nothing. Their scientific value is nil, particularly because they are visual consultations - the doctor takes a look at the rectum of the arrested person and writes his report.\"\n\nAsked why he carried out such examinations, Dr Chahrour replied with an air of resignation:\"I just implement the orders of the office of the prosecutor-general.\"\n\n'Homophobia'\n\nFor the gay community in Lebanon, the message is clear.\n\n\"It's rape by doctors upon the request of the prosecutor-general,\"said Charbel al-Maydaa from Helem.\"This is another homophobic practice aimed at intimidating the gay community in Lebanon.\"\n\n\"It also runs against the principle of the presumption of innocence accorded to the accused person. Here they're trying to prove his culpability rather than his innocence,\"he added.\n\nMr Qortbawi is also adamant that the tests are bad practice. \n\nA veteran lawyer, he is proud of his record in defending human rights in Lebanon and appears to be satisfied with his role in issuing of the memorandum.\n\nBut what about Article 534 of the penal code? \n\n\"That's a completely different issue,\"Mr Qortbawi insisted.\"The law is a mirror of society. And I think we still need a lot of time before we get that far.\"\nTL;DR: Gay-rights activists in Lebanon are calling on the authorities to stop performing anal examinations on men suspected of having \"sexual intercourse contrary to nature\".

Incidents have included a school badly damaged by rain after lead was stolen from the roof (costing \u00a311,000), and the theft of a water tank, boiler and copper pipe at a football club changing rooms (\u00a318,000).\n\nAnthony Hunt, Torfaen's executive member for resources, said every penny spent on damage was a penny lost from frontline services.\n\n\"With the rise in the scrap metal value, it suddenly became a problem,\"he said.\n\n\"But because we've worked closely with the police and metal collectors, hopefully that will lead to a big improvement in this.\"\n\nHe said the council had taken action, with one of its main weapons being SmartWater, which is used to mark items with a special liquid that is invisible to the naked eye but can be seen under UV light.\n\nThe SmartWater is applied to everything from computers to manhole covers and cannot be washed off.\n\nLast year, it helped bring about the jailing of a man for the theft of lead in Pontypool.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks Torfaen is a soft target has certainly got the wrong idea and the full force of the law will be brought against them,\"added Mr Hunt.\n\nOther local authorities in Wales have also been hit hard. \n\nThe cost to Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) last year was \u00a3110,000 and, over the past five years, the council has been hit with a bill for \u00a3400,000 because of metal thefts.\n\nA total of 16 schools in RCT were affected, including Tonypandy Primary School which was targeted twice by lead thieves over the summer leaving holes in the roof which caused rain damage.\n\nMany other councils elsewhere also reported lead thefts from schools including Flintshire, Powys, Anglesey, Denbighshire and Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nMetal thefts present a major problem for the police, accounting for around 10% of all crimes.\n\nOfficers say they take it very seriously and a number of operations have been taking place to combat it.\n\nSgt Clark is working on Operation Tornado, a scheme being introduced in the whole of the UK where scrap operators insist on seeing a seller's photographic ID and a utility bill before buying metal.\n\nBut even then there can be problems.\n\n\"The scrapyards have to keep a book - who has come in, name and address, what vehicle has brought it in, and time and date,\"he said.\n\nMetal seized\n\n\"What happens is they don't check those details are valid.

            "test_query": "By Kevin LeonardBBC Wales News\n\nMetal thefts cost councils in Wales at least \u00a3820,000 in 2011/12, according to figures obtained by BBC Wales.\n\nPolice say metal thefts generally are falling but there is concern council property is being targeted at a time when their finances are stretched.\n\nCouncils say efforts to combat the problem are starting to take effect.\n\nA BBC Wales freedom of information request suggests the cost of metal thefts to councils in Wales has increased by around \u00a3144,000 compared to 2010/11 and by over \u00a3530,000 on the year before that.\n\nMost councils were able to provide figures for the last year, and some for the past five years.\n\nTwo councils in the Gwent Police force area are thought to have been worst hit in the past year: Torfaen (\u00a3247,176) and Caerphilly (\u00a3132,431).\n\nSgt Simon Clark of Gwent Police, who works full time tackling metal theft, said he was surprised by the rise in the cost to councils when overall figures were coming down.\n\n\"Across Wales, metal theft has been reduced by 22% in the last year and in Gwent it's been reduced by 45%,\"he said.\n\n\"I think councils are seen as a bit of a soft target.\"\n\nMetal thefts have cost Welsh councils over \u00a32.5m in the past five years, according to the figures.\n\nTorfaen council has been particularly hard hit recently. Incidents have included a school badly damaged by rain after lead was stolen from the roof (costing \u00a311,000), and the theft of a water tank, boiler and copper pipe at a football club changing rooms (\u00a318,000).\n\nAnthony Hunt, Torfaen's executive member for resources, said every penny spent on damage was a penny lost from frontline services.\n\n\"With the rise in the scrap metal value, it suddenly became a problem,\"he said.\n\n\"But because we've worked closely with the police and metal collectors, hopefully that will lead to a big improvement in this.\"\n\nHe said the council had taken action, with one of its main weapons being SmartWater, which is used to mark items with a special liquid that is invisible to the naked eye but can be seen under UV light.\n\nThe SmartWater is applied to everything from computers to manhole covers and cannot be washed off.\n\nLast year, it helped bring about the jailing of a man for the theft of lead in Pontypool.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks Torfaen is a soft target has certainly got the wrong idea and the full force of the law will be brought against them,\"added Mr Hunt.\n\nOther local authorities in Wales have also been hit hard. \n\nThe cost to Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) last year was \u00a3110,000 and, over the past five years, the council has been hit with a bill for \u00a3400,000 because of metal thefts.\n\nA total of 16 schools in RCT were affected, including Tonypandy Primary School which was targeted twice by lead thieves over the summer leaving holes in the roof which caused rain damage.\n\nMany other councils elsewhere also reported lead thefts from schools including Flintshire, Powys, Anglesey, Denbighshire and Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nMetal thefts present a major problem for the police, accounting for around 10% of all crimes.\n\nOfficers say they take it very seriously and a number of operations have been taking place to combat it.\n\nSgt Clark is working on Operation Tornado, a scheme being introduced in the whole of the UK where scrap operators insist on seeing a seller's photographic ID and a utility bill before buying metal.\n\nBut even then there can be problems.\n\n\"The scrapyards have to keep a book - who has come in, name and address, what vehicle has brought it in, and time and date,\"he said.\n\nMetal seized\n\n\"What happens is they don't check those details are valid. We've had Elvis Presley taking scrap in, Joe Bloggs, we've had all sorts.\"\n\nHe said Gwent Police were taking action to ensure scrapyards were complying with the record keeping. \n\nIn another operation, 20 people were arrested and thousands of pounds worth of material recovered during a three-week crackdown in Caerphilly county.\n\nBritish Transport Police and Gwent Police carried out checks on so called\"itinerant collectors\", stopping and searching 44 vehicles with 15 loads of scrap metal seized.\n\nDet Insp Mark Cleland, of British Transport Police, said officers were looking to expand the operation into other areas in the Gwent Police force area and further afield.\n\n\"It's saving lives at the end of the day.

The NSA faced questions about whether it had found the right balance and now it may be the CIA's turn.\n\nThere will be anger in the CIA and some of that will be directed at Wikileaks. \n\nWikileaks has said the source of this latest cache of documents came from a former US government hacker or contractor. \n\nBut it is an organisation that the US intelligence community has claimed may have been a route for information hacked from the Democrats by the Russians during last year's election to make it into the public domain.  \n\nNo doubt the CIA will be trying to establish the exact source of the latest leak and understand the timing - coming right in the middle of an intensifying row between American spies and their own president.\nTL;DR: Already embroiled in a row with President Donald Trump amid his claims that spies are leaking secrets against him, now the CIA is facing its own damaging leaks.\n\nArticle: There is a lot of swiping in the new app, also called Narendra Modi (Google Play Store, free).\n\nYou swipe up to reveal new instructions. Swipe down to refresh the app's feed. Swipe left to approve of his government's new schemes, and swipe right to find new schemes to approve by swiping left. \n\nIt is like Tinder (the international dating app) for good governance, except all you can do is approve, and share your approval. \n\nOften, you're not even sure what you're approving. The first question in the app's\"Poll\"section just asks:\"Which of the following government initiatives do you think has had the most.\"The most what? \n\nIt does not matter. \n\nAll that matters is that you approve of the question, and tell your 900 Facebook friends, like I did, that you strongly believe that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India campaign) has\"had the most\". \n\nThe app has a quiet desperation to it, a weakly repetitive insistence that you share, share, share. You cannot even read your daily Modi news without logging in via Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or your Narendra Modi account (presumably the app's target demographic), and the little green\"Share\"button is the only consistent element in the app's otherwise confused design ethos.  \n\nGaming approval \n\nWhen I first loaded up the Narendra Modi App, I was expecting this: \n\nA simple Modi-centric aggregator, built to amplify the well-oiled social media machine his campaign pioneered. Grafted to that, a one-stop shop for Modi news and updates, culled from his many productive online channels.  You can listen to old episodes of the PM's weekly radio show, or read all the (positive) media coverage he is receiving. I was expecting all that.    \n\nWhat I was not expecting was a videogame. \n\n\"Earn points and win badges\"is one of the first things the app tells you about itself.\"Badges come with recognition and increased responsibility.\"\n\nOkay. \n\n\"Earn them all and establish yourself as a true changemaker.\" \n\nThis is where things get both clever and insidious. The app\"gamifies\"your approval of the government's policies - giving you the incremental opiate buzz of points ticking upwards and badges awarded. As a gamer, this opened some kind of ancient competitive gristle in my mind. I had 10 points, the app told me. Get 80, and I'd be awarded the\"Pro Active\"badge. \n\nChallenge accepted, Mr Modi. \n\nThere are two ways to earn\"points\"- approve of the government's policies (by\"Liking\"posts) and share them (by posting articles from the app on your own feeds). I got right into it. I answered the aforementioned poll question for five points. I Liked a post about Mr Modi attending a World Yoga Day rally for two points. I shared his lecture at the Dhaka University earlier in June for two points. \n\nAnd that was it. Nothing left to approve.\"Stay tuned!\"the app said cheerfully.\"Contribute by [showing] support towards various policies.\"I was stuck at 19 points, 61 short of that\"Pro Active\"badge. Desperate for policies to approve.     \n\nI consoled myself by reading some of the app's other content - episodes from Mr Modi's life, written with breathless reverence. I learnt that he was a\"Man of Organisation\", who had\"mastered the Art of Governance\". \n\nI pored over Charts and Infographics (literally, because you can't zoom into them) flanking articles about the government policies, written like press releases. The app has a decent reading interface with a thoughtful layout that lets you filter for photos, charts or embedded videos. \n\nWith nothing else to do, and no apparent way to earn my badge, I stumbled upon the\"Give Feedback\"section of the app. I remembered its insistence that I\"contribute\"in whatever way I could, and I considered writing a thoughtful critique of the videogame component, and how its points economy was fundamentally broken.  \n\nBut I couldn't be bothered. After all, I couldn't even get my\"Pro Active\"badge. \n\nSo how much would I give this app? Two stars. \n\nKrish Raghav is a comic book artist, policy analyst and podcaster.

And now, in the spoken word too.\n\nSearch is Google's raison d'etre and cash cow, bringing in a bulk of its $50bn (\u00a333bn) revenues last year. It is also, says Mr Gomes,\"about having a continuous conversation with the user to find out what he wants\".\n\nFor a change, we are having a conversation with Mr Gomes, the boy-like 45-year-old guru of search in Googleplex, the funky low-slung company headquarters set in the manicured greens of Mountain View, California.\n\nMr Gomes works out of an untidy cubicle with four other top engineers in Building 43, the Mecca of search. There are papers strewn around, a headphone lies idly on his table and numbers are scribbled on a whiteboard.\n\nWrapped around the thin walls near his standing workstation are posters of Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky's work.\n\nFrom his modest lair, Mr Gomes and his team work relentlessly on their fine-tooth comb search of the worldwide web to serve up the popular search engine, which is now a part of our everyday lives.\n\n\"When I joined Google in 1999, search was about basically finding the words that you search for in a document. Then we took this view that we were going to understand what you want and give you what you need,\"he says.\n\nToday, crawling through more than 20 billion pages a day on the continuously expanding world wide web, Mr Gomes and his army of search - a substantial number of the company's 44,000 employees - use algorithms in an attempt to make search intuitive, multimedia and super smart.\n\nThe\"maths that computers use to decide stuff\"- as algorithm expert Kevin Slavin called it once - helps rank pages in order of their importance, identifies spelling errors, provides alternatives to words, predicting auto-complete queries, and does unified searches using images, audio and video and voice.  \n\nThey also try to delve into the deeper meaning of words searched for -\"less'searchese' and more natural language\", as one employee tells me - and recognises words with similar meanings.\n\nAnd then, with a hint of understated pride, Mr Gomes talks animatedly about Knowledge Graph, a new function launched last year to make the site's algorithms\"act more human\"in an attempt to offer instant answers to search questions. Time magazine called it the\"next frontier for search\".\n\n\"It's a database of all things in the world. It pulls together different databases and unifies them into a single coherent one that has about 500 to 600 million people, places and things in them and about 18 billion attributes and connections between those things,\"he says.\n\nBut some sceptics like independent technology columnist Mala Bhargava believe there are some pitfalls.\n\n\"Google does a great job of evolving search continuously, slipping in new features all the time. But innovation always walks a tightrope between being useful, even prescient, and being so excessively personalised and targeted as to be meaningless,\"she says.\n\nBut folks at Google believe the fact that it handles a mind-boggling 100-billion plus searches every month, or over three billion a day is testimony to its popularity. A good 15% of the search questions it sees every day are new - queries it has never answered before.\n\nThen there's the giddy speed of search.\n\nWhen Mr Gomes joined Google in 1999 after a stint in Sun Microsystems working on Java programming language, some searches could take up to 20 seconds. When I keyed in Ben Gomes on Google recently it spat out 19,000,000 results in.28 seconds.  (Most of the top ranked results were about the search guru himself.)\n\nChemical interest\n\nWhat the search on Mr Gomes possibly will not tell you is that as a young boy growing up in Bangalore, he was more fascinated with chemistry than computers in the beginning. \n\nSo much so, he recounts, that one day he picked up some sulphuric acid from a city shop, and walked into his school,\"swinging the bottle in my hand, so happy\".\n\nBut then he went to a school with classmates like Krishna Bharat, a computer fiend who later become the man behind Google news, and which counted Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail, among its students.\n\nSo when his brother bought him a small microcomputer in 1983, young Ben joined a small bunch of people interested in machines in what then still was a technophobic country.\n\nMr Gomes, son of a car distributor father and a school teacher mother, moved to the US 25 years ago.

They are likely to try to dismantle the military infrastructure that Syria has effectively rebuilt since 2015. \n\nMore ambitiously, and also more risky, the United States might declare a longer-term policy of revisiting these targets to keep them out of use and have Syrian aircraft bottled up inside their Russian bases - in effect trying to operate a quasi\"no-fly zone\"in Syria, at least for a while. \n\nLast year when the US struck President Assad's Shayrat airbase in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun, the Syrian air force made sure it was seen to be back in action within a day. The US will be determined that this does not happen again, which is why we can expect this to be a more prolonged air campaign with repeated attacks on key sites.\n\nWhat strategic purpose can be served by this?\n\nIt certainly won't make any immediate difference to the civil population of Syria, who have suffered so much at the hands of their own government, and the multitude of rebel, terrorist and guerrilla groups, some of whom have intimidated, as much as they have represented, them.  \n\nAnd President Assad is unlikely to relent in his determination to consolidate his hold on the country. \n\nSo why take all the risks of escalation with Russia and the prospects of unintended consequences that normally follow?\n\nOn its own, military force is meaningless. It has to be part of a political strategy and in this case the strategy is about bigger issues than Syria itself and only offers a long-shot hope for the Syrian population. \n\nThe first objective is to push back against the increasing\"normalisation\"of chemical weapons being used in wars of any kind.\n\nThe taboo against them has been surprisingly strong since the end of World War One. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 has been one of the most effective disarmament measures in modern history. Syria is a signatory to it.  \n\nIn 2013 President Obama claimed he would uphold that taboo as a\"red line\", but then didn't. And despite firm denials from the Assad government, there is an abundance of evidence that Syrian forces, with Russian connivance, have been using chemical weapons against their own people on a regular basis ever since.\n\nMany Western politicians feel that - with all the moral grey areas of this situation - they cannot sell the pass on this issue yet again. It has become a test case for the international rule of law, which is under severe pressure on many fronts.\n\nBeyond that, some argue effective military action would represent an acceptance that Western powers have got to get back into the game of Middle East politics at a time when the region is melting down. \n\nThe campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) was always a geopolitical sideshow, and Western influence on what has been happening from Lebanon to the Yemen has been in steep decline. \n\nOf course, it is tempting, and understandable, for Western leaders to want to leave it all alone. But while they took their eye off the ball fighting IS, the future of the area was being determined by Iran, Russia and partly also by Turkey. \n\nThe calculation is whether long-term Western interests are served better by involvement than indifference to a constellation of powers that is sliding out of control.\n\nAnd the hope for the Syrian population is that an effective military campaign could possibly push President Assad back into negotiations so that the war might end with something more humane than a vicious victory.  \n\nUsing military force is never easy, but it can only be effective if it is part of a coherent and realistic political strategy. \n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nProfessor Michael Clarke is a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (Rusi), and associate director of the Strategic Studies Institute. \n\nEdited by Jennifer Clarke.\nTL;DR: As the US and UK governments continue to discuss their potential response to  the suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma in Syria , what could military intervention achieve?\n\nArticle: Incumbent party candidate Mr Moreno won 51.16% of the vote, the country's electoral council announced. \n\nConservative Guillermo Lasso, whom three exit polls predicted would win after the vote on Sunday, got 48.8%.\n\nMr Lasso has already indicated he will challenge the vote, having earlier alleged fraud.\n\nBut with 99.65% of ballots counted, the National Electoral Council's Pablo Pozo said these were the\"irreversible official results\".\n\n\"We congratulate the Ecuadoran people, who have legally and legitimately elected their president,\"he said.\n\n\"Ecuador has spoken freely at the ballot box and it is our ethical duty to respect its vote and its voice.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, Mr Moreno tweeted:\"Many thanks to all Ecuadorians, who voted for us and who did not, and democracy is strengthened.\"\n\nCorrespondents say his win bucks the trend across Latin America of people turning their backs on the left in favour of the right. \n\nHe succeeds his close ally Rafael Correa after three terms of what Mr Correa and his administration dubbed\"21st-Century socialism\".\n\nOn Sunday, when it first emerged he looked likely to lose, Mr Lasso called for people to\"peacefully defend their votes\".\n\nIt resulted in hundreds of Mr Lasso's supporters gathering in front of the electoral commission offices shouting\"No to fraud\".\n\nThe Organization of American States, which acted as an observer during the election, said it had seen\"no discrepancies\"between polling station and official results.\n\nMr Lasso has until 12 April to challenge the result officially, the electoral council said.\n\nWho is Lenin Moreno?\nTL;DR: Socialist Lenin Moreno has been declared the winner of Ecuador's closely contested presidential election.\n\nArticle: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks threatening civilians, infrastructure and shipping.\n\nIt would also deter\"malign activity\"by their backer Iran, he added.\n\nAid organisations have said they may be prevented from operating in areas where millions are on the brink of famine. \n\nA UN spokesman said it was clear the US decision was\"likely to have serious humanitarian and political repercussions\", while the president of the International Rescue Committee called it\"pure diplomatic vandalism\".\n\nA Houthi leader accused President Donald Trump's administration of terrorism and said the movement reserved the right to respond to any designation.\n\nYemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states launched a military operation to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's rule.\n\nThe coalition has received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France, while Iran has denied allegations that it has supplied the Houthis with missiles, drones, and training.\n\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 110,000 people dead and triggered what the United Nations (UN) says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection.\n\nMr Pompeo announced late on Sunday that the state department would notify Congress of his intention to designate the Houthi movement - known formally as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God) - as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump leave's office. \n\nThree Houthi leaders - Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abdul Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim - will also be listed as Specially Designated Global Terrorists.\n\n\"The designations are intended to hold Ansar Allah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure, and commercial shipping,\"Mr Pompeo said.\n\n\"The designations are also intended to advance efforts to achieve a peaceful, sovereign, and united Yemen that is both free from Iranian interference and at peace with its neighbours.\"\n\nThe secretary of state cited what he called\"the callous attack\"targeting the airport in the southern city of Aden on 30 December, in which 27 people were killed. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government tied the attack on the Houthis, but they denied any involvement.\n\n\"America is the source of terrorism, the Trump administration's policy is terrorist, and its actions are terrorist. It does not matter to the Yemeni people, as it is complicit in killing and starving them,\"Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi tweeted in response on Monday.\n\nHe added that the rebels\"reserve the right to respond to any designation issued by the Trump administration or any administration\".\n\nYemen's foreign ministry said it supported the move and called for further\"political and legal pressure\"on the Houthis, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThis designation has been expected for months, so advocates and opponents have been gearing up for it for some time. There has been discussion, too, over whether it should target the Houthis as a group or individuals. A Saudi source recently admitted it would be difficult to determine who was a Houthi. \n\nBut US allies in the Gulf are backers of a step meant to send a strong signal to Iran. Some argue it could provide a valuable bargaining chip for the incoming Biden administration to secure concessions. But Western diplomats involved in protracted efforts to start a political process to end this destructive war are convinced this will make it even harder.\n\nThe biggest concern is humanitarian. The US says it will ensure life-saving supplies still reach Yemen. Time and again, when sanctions are imposed, it is the most innocent who suffer most. In Yemen, the impact could be catastrophic if the right measures are not put in place.  \n\nMr Pompeo said the US recognised the concerns of humanitarian organisations and would work to reduce the impact on what he called\"certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen\".\n\n\"We are working to ensure that essential lifelines and engagements that support a political track and return to dialogue continue to the maximum extent possible.\"\n\nUN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters it was imperative that the US\"swiftly grant the necessary licenses and exemptions to ensure that principled humanitarian assistance can continue to reach all people... without disruption\".\n\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned in November against a unilateral US designation, saying Yemen was in\"imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades\".\n\nFive million people are living\"just one step away from famine\"in Yemen, and approximately 50,000 are living in\"famine-like conditions\", according to the UN. \n\nThe president of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, warned that the designation would make the task of its teams on the ground in Yemen\"all but impossible\".\n\n\"Our concerns are not theoretical or hyperbolic, recent history - especially in Somalia - has shown us that cost of terrorism designations in the middle of complex conflicts and humanitarian crises can be measured in innocent lives lost,\"he said.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council called on US President-elect Joe Biden to\"act upon taking office to ensure Yemeni civilians can still receive life-saving aid\".\n\nThe organisation's secretary general, Jan Egeland, tweeted that US\"exemptions for aid work and civilian supplies must be crystal-clear\".\n\nBut Oxfam America's humanitarian policy lead Scott Paul expressed doubt that US assurances would be\"good enough to convince many of the banks and donors to keep the money flowing\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:\nTL;DR: The US plans to designate Yemen's rebel Houthi movement as a terrorist group, despite warnings that it may threaten aid operations in the war-torn country.\n\nArticle: The prince was not named, but he and four other Saudis were arrested after two tonnes of Captagon pills were found in cases being loaded on a private jet.\n\nThe others charged in the case - three Lebanese and two Saudis - are at large.\n\nCaptagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East.\n\nThe drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting.\n\nCaptagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. But it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because it was too addictive.\n\nIn 2013, the UN said 64% of global seizures of amphetamine took place in the Middle East, and that most of the amphetamine was in the form of Captagon pills.\nTL;DR: Prosecutors in Lebanon have charged a Saudi prince and nine other people with drug smuggling, a week after a record seizure at Beirut's airport.\n\nArticle: Nick TriggleHealth correspondent\n\nOver 200 new organisations are being created, including a network of GP-led groups to manage the budget and NHS England, the national board which will oversee the new system.\n\nIt has been dubbed the most radical shake-up in the history of the NHS.\n\nBut what will actually be changing?\n\nAn end of the'special relationship'\n\nEver since the NHS was created GPs have acted as the gatekeepers to the service, referring patients on to the right areas.\n\nThe relationship has meant that a special bond is often created between patient and their GP - or family doctor as they are known.\n\nPolling consistently places doctors as among the highest trusted professionals.\n\nBut under the reforms GPs are getting control of the bulk of the NHS budget, so they can decide what local services to fund.\n\nThe theory is that as they are close to patients they will be better placed to know how money should be spent.\n\nBut the prospect of them holding the purse strings has caused concern that the\"special relationship\"could be damaged.\n\nAn Ipsos Mori poll for the British Medical Association found nearly three quarters of GPs feared this.\n\nIt argued patients could become suspicious if a doctor does not give them what they want as there could be a perception the GP is trying to save money rather than safeguarding their best interests.\n\nThis is the issue that has caused most controversy. \n\nCritics have claimed the reforms will lead to the privatisation of the health service with health companies swooping in to\"cherry pick\"the most profitable services and destabilising NHS in the process.\n\nBut supporters believe the opportunities for the private sector are being overplayed. They say that if the firms can provide better services, more efficiently it will be good for patients and drive up standards across the whole sector.\n\nOf course, the private sector is already involved in providing NHS care.\n\nUnder the Labour government they were invited to bid for contracts to carry out non-emergency operations, such as hip and knee replacements.\n\nThey have also got heavily involved in mental health care.\n\nMeanwhile, over the past year, the coalition government has been encouraging them to get more involved in community services.\n\nEstimates suggest \u00a31 out of every \u00a320 spent on health goes to a non-NHS provider, this includes both private sector firms and charities.\n\nOne of the guiding principles for the reforms has been the push to improve the coordination of care for people with chronic conditions.\n\nThese are diseases such as diabetes and dementia for which there is no cure.\n\nInstead of bouts of hospital treatment these patients need long-term support from a range of different services, it is widely argued.\n\nBut all too often such care is not available and these patients end up in hospitals when they suffer crises and emergencies.\n\nWith better planning such problems could be prevented - evidence suggests as many as a third of hospital admissions are avoidable.\n\nIf this is to succeed it is likely to see a network of integrated community clinics emerge, which run a variety of services from rehabilitation care to district nursing.\n\nA much often overlooked part of the reforms involves public health. The term covers everything that prevents disease and prolongs life and therefore includes promoting physical activity and better diets as well as stop smoking services.\n\nResponsibility for this will be passed to local government as part of the changes.\n\nThe belief is that councils will be better placed to influence people's lives through their powers over planning, education and leisure services.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, public health directors who have been working for primary care trusts are being transferred into local authorities.\n\nThey will also get a ring-fenced budget of just under \u00a33bn a year to ensure there is money available to get the new arrangements up-and-running - the rest of local government is facing budget cuts of a quarter.\n\nAlready councils have started looking at innovative ways of tackling the issue. This includes stopping smoking near to playgrounds to introducing outdoor gyms in parks and green spaces.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable thing will be the fact that there will be little visible change - certainly in the short-term.\n\nThat may seem unbelievable given the amount of attention the changes have attracted.\n\nBut the upheaval that has taken place so far has largely been to the management structure.\n\nIt means as patients move around the new NHS they could be forgiven for thinking nothing has happened.\n\nThey will still go to their local GP surgery or hospital when they need help.\n\nIndeed, many of the other factors discussed here are ones that will take some time to have an impact.\n\nThis, of course, does not mean what is happening is not important. Virtually everyone agrees - critics and supporters alike - that the NHS stands to rise or fall on the effect of the reforms.\n\nIt is just that the NHS, with its 1.4m staff and hundreds of different organisations, really is, has often been said, a bit like a supertanker - a change in direction does not happen immediately.\nTL;DR: The government's reforms of the NHS in England are coming into force.\n\nArticle: By Michael RaceBBC News\n\nWelcoming the teenager to Cumnor Cricket Club, a village club on the outskirts of Oxford, chairman Roger Mitty took Ali to the pavilion where he had laid out some kit for him. \n\n\"He looked at me as though I had given him lottery winnings or something. It was just a wonderful feeling,\"Mr Mitty said.\"He couldn't speak much English, but he was obviously so pleased to be there.\"\n\nAli had arrived in England after a perilous journey lasting more than a year, and went to live with a distant cousin in Oxford. He had been obsessed with cricket in his homeland, playing for hours with a broom handle for a bat, but it was in England that he got the chance to develop as a cricketer.\n\nThe image of this\"very shy boy\", who was\"obviously mad about cricket\"is a first impression that has never left Mr Mitty.\n\nAs their relationship developed, father-of-three Mr Mitty treated the young Afghan as a fourth child, throwing him birthday parties, helping him through his education and celebrating Christmases together. The Mitty family and Cumnor's members began to learn snippets of how this young man with the engaging smile had come to arrive in Oxford.\n\nSmuggled out of Afghanistan due to the mortal danger posed to him by the Taliban, Ali endured a brutal trek across Europe. At one stage during his journey, he was halted by illness and started vomiting uncontrollably as he crawled up the side of a mountain with a group of fellow migrants in Ukraine.\n\n\"I was praying that I would just die because I couldn't walk. Somehow I would get energy and I would just crawl and crawl,\"he said.\"I had one shirt and jeans and was crawling in the snow. I thought I was finished.\"\n\nBut he finally made it to the refugee camps in Calais and, from there, on to the UK in the back of a lorry. \n\n\"I didn't know where my journey would take me,\"he said.\"I think now... the cold weather with one shirt and jeans - how did I do that? It was amazing. I learned a lot about people.\"\n\n\"His journey from Afghanistan was extraordinary and I just felt I wanted to try and show him some love and concern and support and encouragement,\"Mr Mitty said. \n\n\"He just stole our hearts, really.\"\n\nAli would spend the next decade playing at Cumnor.\"There is nowhere else in the world where there is a ground like that. It is in my heart,\"he said.\n\nAs the teenager grew into a man, his flamboyant batting style and penetrative bowling saw the all-rounder rise through the ranks to become one of the club's greatest talents. His approach on the field could be compared to his life off it - he was always up for the fight. \n\nAnd Ali needed to draw on his inner strength again when the Home Office threatened him with deportation.\n\nHe had been given a two-year emergency visa when he arrived in the UK in 2002, but as he approached his 18th birthday Ali was told he would be sent back to Afghanistan. It sparked a campaign led by Mr Mitty and the community of Cumnor, which included lobbying MPs and obtaining evidence from Afghan leaders about the threat to Ali's life.\n\n\"There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that if he had gone back that would have been the end of him,\"Mr Mitty said.\"I remember saying to my wife, probably at one of the worrying moments when it wasn't looking terribly good, that if I didn't save him I would never forgive myself.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:  \n\nCrucially, the campaign group was able to obtain a fax from Kabul.\n\n\"It was a declaration signed by all the elders of the village that Ali had come from declaring he would certainly be killed if he was ever returned,\"Mr Mitty said.\"That was the best evidence - straight from the horse's mouth.\"\n\nEventually, Ali was sent a letter by the British government with his\"passport for freedom\".\n\nDuring the time his future in the UK was in doubt, Ali had learned English, sat his GCSEs and secured a place to study accounting at Oxford Brookes University.\n\nMr Mitty, who is now president at Cumnor Cricket Club, said what struck him about Ali was that\"he wasn't portraying himself as a victim\". \n\n\"He would often say to me'it's just so wonderful that even though I have a different culture, background, race and religion, people like you and people at Cumnor have shown me all this support, love and affection'.\"\n\nMr Mitty said cricket\"drove\"Ali, adding he had a\"natural talent, a natural gift\"for the game, with his excellent technique in part a product of his early days playing with a broom handle.\n\nAli's performances caught the eye of Oxford Marylebone Cricket Club University, which selected the all-rounder for a game against Worcestershire County Cricket Club in April 2009. He thus became only the third Afghan to play first-class cricket in England, after current national team star Mohammad Nabi in 2007 and Mumtaz Habibullah in 2006.\n\nFollowing a trip to Melbourne in Australia, in 2013 Ali was given the chance to play club cricket there, an offer that proved too good to turn down.\n\nAfter 11 years in England, Ali left behind his adoptive family in Cumnor, and in Australia would go on to marry a woman from his homeland. As a record for their two children, he has written a book - Staring at Death - to document his past.\n\nThe 32-year-old has now spent more of his life out of Afghanistan than in it, but he still harbours hopes of being able to visit his village of Dah Murdah in Ghazni province - although he's been told it remains too dangerous for him to go there.\n\nAnd while Ali has made a life for himself in Australia, he said he still considers Cumnor to be his home.\n\n\"Roger is my father,\"he said.\n\n\"I will always remember him and what he did for me.\"\nTL;DR: Morteza Ali fled Afghanistan aged 14 after the Taliban killed his family. He eventually made his way to England, where he met the man who would become his second father.\n\nArticle: In 1991, the Children of the 90s Project recruited 14,500 pregnant women to chart their health and that of their children.\n\nProf Nic Timpson said the team wants to understand how the virus spreads from infected people who have no symptoms.\n\nThe Bristol-based project also aims to record the impact of staying at home on people's finances, fitness and health.\n\n'Subtle ways'\n\n\"It is important is to understand how it travels through the population - who is harbouring the disease without knowing it and how risky it is to allow those people to carry on doing their ordinary life things,\"said Prof Timpson.\n\nOnce a suitable antibody test is available researchers hope to test participants to find out what proportion have had Covid-19 but were unaware of it.\n\nThe study will also look at the social effects of lockdown.\n\nProf Timpson said many people will have had their lives\"turned upside down\".\n\n\"All this will have a very different effect on people, both in a practical way thinking about finance and the way families work, but also in more subtle ways to do with people's behaviour, their fitness and health but also their mental health.\"\n\nTrainee teacher, Lydia Blakemore Phillips was one of the original children of the 90s.\n\nShe said:\"It feels really exciting, it reinforces the fact that being part of this study is being part of something much bigger than yourself.\n\n\"The fact that your experiences can be really different from other people can help to draw a really clear image of young people and coronavirus.\"\nTL;DR:",

It has also inspired an accompanying music video.\n\nThe song features strongly worded criticism of the US and a vow to\"beat it out of its wits\". \n\nChina is no stranger to propaganda songs. Karaoke is popular in China and Beijing knows that songs are an effective way of conveying official thinking to young people.\n\nAnd with tensions escalating between China and the US, after the latter raised tariffs on some $200bn (\u00a3153.7bn) worth of Chinese products, the song has been an effective way for China to build its soft power and stir anti-US sentiment. \n\nThe song\n\nLast week, retired Chinese official and lyricist Zhao Liangtian posted the musical score for the Trade War song in a WeChat group called\"The World's China Writers.\"\n\nIt attracted significant attention on the WhatsApp-like platform, and a subsequent post showing the song as a music video went viral. The three-minute video shows an animated fist set against flames, while scenic photographs of Beijing flash across the screen. \n\nIt is set to the tune of a well-known wartime anti-Japanese propaganda film, Tunnel Warfare, and sounds like an army chant.\n\n\"I chose Tunnel Warfare because that is reminiscent of the similar situation that China is facing today,\"Mr Zhao told Bloomberg News.\"Since the trade war broke out, I felt the urge to do something,\"he said.\n\nHe adapted the lyrics for the recent deterioration in trade relations with the US:\n\n\"Trade war, trade war, not afraid of the outrageous challenge.\n\n\"A trade war is happening over the Pacific Ocean, the Belt and Road has even become a segment.\n\n\"If the perpetrator wants to fight, we will beat him out of his wits.\"\n\n'US imperialists'\n\nMore than 100,000 WeChat users have watched the video, and it has generated a great deal of discussion on Sina Weibo - China's version of Twitter. \n\n\"His words have filled people with passion,\"commented one WeChat user whose post received more than 100 likes. \n\nMany on the platform praised\"Teacher Zhao\". One user got 1,000 likes for calling him a\"heroic patriotic warrior.\"\n\nOthers praised the song as a way of\"hitting\"the US.\"Those US imperialists and their wolfish ambitions,\"posted one user. \n\nBut some Weibo users voiced bemusement that China was promoting a song about a trade war.\"This thinking makes us no better than North Korea,\"wrote one.\n\nA history of musical propaganda\n\nTrade War is not the first song that the state has released to promote China's strength amid disputes with other nations, and China has had a track record of producing songs with an anti-US line. \n\nIn May last year, official media promoted a song called For Your Attention\", featuring a five-member boyband singing about domestic brands and how they are\"the pride of China\".\n\nThe song promoted the idea that China was a rising superpower, and that people no longer needed to buy products from overseas. \n\nAnd in May 2017, official media widely promoted a multilingual rap by Sichuanese group CD Rev called No to the THAAD - criticising South Korea for working with the US to deploy a now-abolished anti-missile system. \n\nThe state has shown it's not afraid to dabble in different genres, and rap in particular has proven popular. During the National Congress in October 2017, the most important political event in the Chinese calendar, China released at least four rap songs. \n\nOne, The Letter, signified the changes that China had seen under President Xi Jinping's leadership. The song helped promote Mr Xi's legacy to young Chinese people and solidify his premiership, which he will now hold for another five years, at least.\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Political rhetoric aside, both the Spanish government and Catalan regional leaders know sentiments are running so high across Spain at the moment, that millions are poised to take to the streets. \n\nSo what's actually going to happen now?\n\nPrime Minister Rajoy has called an emergency cabinet meeting this Saturday to decide whether to proceed with triggering Article 155 and if so, which precise measures they plan to take and in what order.\n\nThey can start gently - removing the Catalan government's powers to pay public sector workers, for example. They could be more severe, such as disbanding the regional police and security forces or there is always the nuclear option of dissolving the Catalan government and parliament; giving back the reins of power to the central government in Madrid. \n\nOnce the shopping list of measures has been decided, the Catalan president has the right of reply and we're told there is no limited window of opportunity for him to do so, meaning this could take days or weeks. \n\nFinally, the Spanish Senate needs to approve the measures. It would certainly do so as Mr Rajoy's party has a majority in the house.\n\nIn the meantime, the Catalan parliament has warned it may well go ahead and vote to declare independence unilaterally. It has planned a meeting on Monday.\n\nAs the rhetoric escalates, the Spanish government needs to consider the practicalities of implementing Article 155.\n\nWhat happens if the Catalan people - or at least hundreds of thousands, if not millions of them - try to block the measures on the streets? They could surround the Catalan parliament and refuse to move, for example.\n\nAnd if the aim of implementing Article 155 is eventually to dissolve the current Catalan government and call regional elections, is it not conceivable that large sections of the Catalan public will refuse to vote? Would the EU finally feel compelled to intervene? \n\nImagine then the international public opinion war that would rage across social media platforms, never mind in the traditional press.\n\nCatalonia is not officially on the discussion agenda at this week's EU summit but around the water coolers, along corridors and over coffee there is sure to be heated debate.\n\nMove over Brexit. Considering the deadlock in negotiations with the UK, Catalonia is the EU's new hot topic du jour.\nTL;DR: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is expected in Brussels on Thursday as planned for a summit of EU leaders but don't be fooled: all is not well at home.\n\nArticle: The 57-year-old was airlifted from Stob Coire nan Lochan, part of the Three Sisters ridges in Glencoe, on Saturday.\n\nHe and another climber, 47, were found at about mid-day, both with hypothermia, after they were reported overdue from a climb the previous day.\n\nPolice Scotland said the older man was in a life-threatening condition at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\nThe other climber is at Belford Hospital in Fort William and described as stable.\n\nThe men, from Nottinghamshire, were found following an extensive search involving police, HM Coastguard and mountain rescue teams.\n\nMajor operation\n\nBrian Bathurst, deputy team leader for Glencoe Mountain Rescue said:\"Both are hypothermic but one more so than the other. \n\n\"One casualty who is worse off has been taken to the Belford Hospital in Fort William by helicopter. \n\n\"The second casualty is walking wounded and is just being picked up. \n\n\"It's been quite a big rescue, it's been a good effort by us and our neighbouring teams.\"\n\nInverness Coastguard helicopter transported Glencoe and Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Teams to the area, while a Prestwick Coastguard helicopter searched the walkers' route.\n\nA spokesperson for HM Coastguard added:\"HM Coastguard Stornoway helicopter was sent to the area just before 22:00 to carry out a search.  They were unable to find the walkers but reported that they did see evidence of an avalanche in the area.  \n\n\"Due to the weather conditions on scene the search was suspended until first light today.\n\n\"The search was resumed just after 08:00 this morning with two Coastguard helicopters from Inverness and Prestwick tasked to assist. \n\n\"One climber was located at mid-day and the helicopter paramedic winchman assessed them for hypothermia.  \n\n\"The second climber was located around 12:30.\"\n\nThe risk of avalanche in Glencoe on Friday and Saturday was rated\"considerable\"by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS), particularly at corrie rims, gully tops and steep slope tops.\n\nA SAIS report warned that conditions would\"remain wintry and unsettled\"for a few days.\nTL;DR: A climber is seriously ill after he went missing overnight on a mountain in the Highlands.\n\nArticle: Mourinho is accused of moving millions of pounds of earnings to the British Virgin Islands to avoid paying tax.\n\nThe Manchester United manager's agent said the allegations were\"unfounded\".\n\nPublic accounts committee chairwoman Meg Hillier told the Sunday Times the claims required\"close examination\". \n\nHM Revenue and Customs said it would not comment on named individuals, but took\"all allegations of tax evasion extremely seriously\"and\"always investigates allegations of fraud together with any intelligence provided\". \n\n'Complex web'\n\nFurther claims about the tax affairs of Mourinho - as well as other top international football stars - have been made in the Sunday Times and other European newspapers. \n\nThe publications acquired leaked documents from the website Football Leaks, following a cyber attack on football agents earlier this year.  \n\nMourinho has been accused of using\"a complex web of off-shore companies\"to avoid paying tax in the UK and Spain.\n\nThe allegations surround his time as manager of UK side Chelsea, between 2004 and 2007, and Spanish club Real Madrid, between 2010 and 2013. \n\nAccording to the reports, Portuguese-born Mourinho, 53, placed \u00a310m (\u20ac12m) into a Swiss account owned by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) firm.\n\nThe newspaper claims Mourinho and his advisers deducted substantial costs for a BVI company - which it suggests has no employees.\n\nThe Sunday Times says Mourinho - as well as Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo - also used bank accounts and companies in Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand to process substantial earnings for their image rights. \n\nHowever, Jorge Mendes - the agent for both Mourinho and ex-Manchester United player Ronaldo - denies the claim.\n\nHe says both men were fully compliant with UK and Spanish tax rules.  \n\nThe statement added that the allegations stemmed from a cyber attack earlier this year on some sports agents, details of which were prohibited by a Spanish court from being published.\n\nThe head of HMRC will appear before Ms Hillier's committee - which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure - this week.\n\nThe Labour MP told the BBC:\"I think it is really important that the tax authorities take a really close look at what's gone on and we will be raising this with them on Wednesday.\"\n\nShe said the allegations would be\"galling\"for football fans who buy season tickets and spend a lot of their disposable income on watching games.\n\n\"On Wednesday, we are already examining HMRC on how they deal with high net-worth individuals and it is clear that there are issues there about the resource they have got and how they go about dealing with people with very large amounts of wealth,\"she said.\n\nA spokesman for the tax authority said last year it had received an additional \u00a3800m\"to help tackle the cheats\"by increasing the number of people prosecuted. \n\nHe added:\"HMRC carefully scrutinises the arrangements between football clubs and their employees in respect of any image right payments to make sure the right tax is paid - in recent years we have identified more than \u00a380m in additional tax payable from clubs, players and agents. \n\n\"We take seriously allegations that customers or their agents may have acted dishonestly in the course of an enquiry, and can reopen closed cases if we suspect this has happened.\"\n\nInternational consortium\n\nThe allegations surrounding Mourinho and Ronaldo are based on two terabytes of leaked information which allegedly includes original contracts. \n\nThe claims were published by an international consortium of journalists - including German newspaper Der Spiegel, Spain's El Mundo and the UK's Sunday Times - which obtained a trove of about 18m documents. \n\nOther top players were also named in the documents.\n\nThe consortium says it intends to publish a series of articles under the banner\"Football Leaks\"over the next few weeks.  \n\nIt comes eight months after the so-called Panama Papers lifted the lid on how the world's rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.\n\nReal Madrid, Ronaldo's current employer, did not respond to requests from news agencies for comment. \n\nManchester United said the allegations related to events before Mourinho's arrival at the club and so it would not comment.\n\nOne of the papers in the consortium, the Dutch NRC, alleges that Ronaldo moved \u20ac63.5m (\u00a353.1m, $67.7m) to the British Virgin Islands at the end of 2014.\n\nThe paper says the striker received sponsorship fees which were moved via two Irish companies to the tax haven, 11 days before Spain changed an advantageous tax law. \n\nAccording to the reports, Friday's first batch of leaks centred on\"a system\"put in place by Mr Mendes, whose company has denied any wrongdoing. \n\nHis company, Gestifute, said in a statement that neither Ronaldo nor Mourinho\"have been implicated in legal proceedings of the tax evasion commission in Spain\".\n\nThe company accused the media consortium of operating in an\"insidious\"way concerning the stars' tax obligations.\nTL;DR: The tax affairs of football manager Jose Mourinho should be investigated by British officials following allegations he used off-shore companies to reduce his tax bill, a UK MP has said.\n\nArticle: LVCR means no VAT is charged on goods valued less than \u00a315, such as CDs, when sent from anywhere outside of the European Union to the UK.\n\nBut it will be scrapped from 1 April and Jersey and Guernsey lost their case in the High Court to try to retain it.\n\nThe islands' governments said hundreds of jobs were at risk when the so-called VAT loophole closes.\n\nBut Jersey's Economic Development Minister, Senator Alan Maclean, said it could take up to two years for Jersey to hear the outcome of any possible appeal if it goes to the European Court.\n\nSenator Maclean and the Chief Minister have been meeting a union over concerns Jersey's docks could be affected when LVCR closes.\n\nHe said freight could suffer as fewer packages are sent to and from Jersey.\n\nSenator Maclean said his department was doing all it could to protect that part of Jersey's economy.\nTL;DR: The States of Jersey will decide whether to appeal against the loss of Low Value Consignment Relief next week.\n\nArticle: NHS Grampian said the changes had been required after parking at Foresterhill had reached\"crisis point\".\n\nFrom now on outpatients will be able to park closer to the hospital's front doors, but staff will have to park further away.\n\nCharges were abolished at all NHS hospitals in 2009 by the Scottish government. \n\nThe revamped system sees staff permit holders being given access to the site's main car park one, while patients and visitors will have access to a separate section in main car park two.\n\nGary Mortimer, general manager for facilities and estates with NHS Grampian, said patients would notice a number of differences.\n\nHe explained:\"Firstly, they're going to be met at our gates by a person on the barrier, who will help them to an appropriate parking space.\n\n\"They'll find parking easier, if they bring their outpatient appointment letter to confirm that they have an appointment at the hospital and hopefully their entire journey from arriving at site to leaving site will be a much less stressful one than it's been.\"\n\nHospital managers have held talks with trade unions and staff about the changes and said there would be some dedicated staff parking spaces near to the main building.\n\nVisitors will also face changes in where they can park.\n\nMr Mortimer said:\"We do have an area that's going to be earmarked for visitor parking, there's about 200 spaces that will be freed up later in the day. \n\n\"They will be available on a first come, first served basis, so we would encourage visitors not to bring their cars, to use the extensive public transport that's now available on the site.\"\n\nThe hospital said it had been working hard to alleviate the disruption caused by the changes by improving transport links and had developed an internal shuttle services to take people from the further away car parks to the main site.\nTL;DR: New parking measures at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary will result in patients being given easier access to the building.\n\nArticle: By Christopher SleightBBC Scotland news\n\nFour years ago, there were just 3,500 electric vehicles in the UK. As of August 2017, there are almost 113,000.\n\nBut many in the industry believe the market will soon see even bigger growth. It's not just Scotland - most European countries have targets for phasing out combustion engine vehicles.\n\n\"It's expected that the big rush to buy electric vehicles (EV) will be this year or next year,\"says Paul Minto.\n\nHe's a partner in the energy and utilities team for global law firm Addleshaw Goddard, and an industry expert.\n\n\"Motor Trade Association figures show sales are now booming. They're on the upward curve.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem that long ago that electric vehicles were mainly for a select band of car buyers who were either very wealthy or who only made very short journeys.\n\nThe advance of technology - in particular battery technology - is changing this rapidly. As the prices comes down and range goes up more people are buying EVs.\n\nBut Mr Minto says that there needs to be a corresponding focus on the infrastructure needed to keep all these batteries topped up, to keep EV owners from suffering the dreaded\"range anxiety\"- the fear your car will slow to a peaceful stop before it reaches its destination.\n\nThe starting point is to install trickle charging points in people's homes.\n\nThis is easy if you have your own drive, but - as Ms Sturgeon has acknowledged - many people in Scotland live in tenements.\n\nSo how do you ensure that several hundred people living in a block of flats can all charge their cars up overnight?\n\nAnd how does the National Grid cope with the inevitable strain as everyone plugs their car in every evening?\n\nThese two problems are the\"missing pieces in the jigsaw\", according to Mr Minto. They're also where the big\"commercial opportunity\"is. There's lots of money to be made for those who can find the answers.\n\nOne of the ways mass-charging points can be created in densely-populated urban areas is with massive batteries kept in shipping container-style boxes.\n\n\"You can locate big batteries anywhere you want and attach EV charging points to those,\"says Mr Minto.\n\n\"Those batteries can be charged at any time of day or night so you do it when it's cheapest. Or you can use a renewable energy source like wind or hydropower to charge them.\"\n\nThese big batteries have two advantages - they're an efficient way of providing a lot of charging points in a small area and they\"smooth out\"the demand for electricity at certain times.\n\nMr Minto says these big batteries could easily be installed in the corner of an office car park and could have 50 charging points attached.\n\nThe batteries already exist, but there's a\"vast\"technology race under way to make them cheaper, smaller and faster-charging, he says.\n\nAnd in urban areas we should be prepared to see parking meter-style charge points popping up on many roads - potentially providing a plug-in facility for every parking space on a busy street.\n\nOther possibilities for charging lots of cars in a small space include more futuristic designs - like towers which stack cars up while charging them.\n\nIt's this type of solution that the Scottish government needs to embrace if mass electric car ownership is to become a reality. It's also one of the reasons Ms Sturgeon announced a \u00a360m innovation fund alongside the 2032 target.\n\nBut Scotland has another big challenge to overcome with electric cars.\n\nAlthough there are densely-populated cities, the vast majority of the country is rural, with big distances between villages or small towns.\n\nIt's enough to make a range-anxious electric car owner go weak at the knees. Or is it?\n\nEs Tresidder lives just outside Fort William, where he runs his own business designing low-energy buildings.\n\nUntil last year, he was living in Brussels where he and his family didn't need a car to get around - but he realised that would change once he moved to Scotland.\n\nBeing immersed in the green economy and low-energy design, he was keen to try an electric car, but wasn't sure if it was the best option in a rural area.\n\n\"I initially thought there was no way it would work. Looking at web forums for electric car owners, I was told by many people it wouldn't work as my only vehicle in somewhere like the Highlands.\n\n\"But then I looked into it a bit more and decided it was worth a gamble.\"\n\n'More convenient'\n\nHe bought a second generation Nissan Leaf, one of the most popular models of electric car in the UK.\n\nMr Tresidder acknowledges there's a perception EVs are only good for small journeys in big cities - but says his experience has been\"surprisingly good\"so far.\n\n\"For most of my usage I won't use the public chargers at all - I just use the one at our house.\n\n\"If you've got somewhere to charge at home or work, that's all you will need for most of your charging,\"he says.\n\nHome chargers like Mr Tresidder's are generally slower, but are fine for overnight charging.\n\n\"It's actually more convenient than a petrol or diesel car because I never have to go to a petrol station.\n\n\"There's also very low maintenance. All I've done on my car in the last 12 months is topped up the windscreen fluid and put some winter tyres on.\"\n\nBroken charger\n\nThe range on Mr Tresidder's Nissan is about 120 miles (193km) - though it varies with the temperature and the speed he drives - which is more than enough for everyday use, he says.\n\n\"When I do go on longer journeys, the average speed in the Highlands means I'm driving long enough that I'm ready for a half-hour break - especially with three children.\"\n\nThe rapid charging technology found at most public charge points will bring the Leaf's batteries up to 80% in about 30 minutes.\n\nMr Tresidder says he's not yet needed to queue to plug his car in and has only found one charger that didn't work.\n\nThat was in Mallaig, where someone let him plug in to their wall socket with a standard three-pin extension lead for a couple of hours, which gave him enough charge to get home.\n\nBut he admits there are occasions when owning an electric car feels a lot more inconvenient than driving a petrol or diesel model.\n\n\"My parents live in Derbyshire and to go to see them I think I have to stop five times [to charge] - that's considerably less convenient.\n\n\"But then I only do that journey a couple of times a year and it's cost me \u00a310 rather than \u00a360 or \u00a370.\"\n\nThere are also apps and websites to show the location of EV charging points - and sometimes even if they're occupied or not - which helps to keep the range anxiety at bay.\n\nThere will clearly need to be a lot more charging points installed around Scotland to keep up with the rise in EV ownership.\n\nOr could part of the change over the next 15 years be a move away from traditional car ownership altogether?\n\nIf fewer people own cars and instead share them, or use public transport, then the pressure on the charging infrastructure is reduced.\n\nMr Minto believes there's likely to be a cultural shift soon.\n\n\"Over the passage of time, the ownership model of cars will become less important. We are may be the last generation to want that,\"he says.\n\n\"Already on the west coast of the USA you see driverless, autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"They're just driverless pods - in effect you're no longer owning a car, you're just sharing time in one.\"\n\nThis might seem impossibly far into the future.\n\n'No sacrifice'\n\nBut Mr Tresidder says he has no doubt that electric vehicles of some kind are in his future. He says he'll never buy another petrol or diesel car again.\n\n\"Driving a petrol or diesel would feel like a step backwards in terms of how nice it is,\"he says.\n\n\"This summer we did a house swap for our holiday which included a car swap.\n\n\"The petrol car we got was noisy and smelly. You had hill starts and the business of balancing the clutch.\n\n\"We stalled it constantly. We spent lots of money at petrol stations. It wasn't that nice at all.\n\n\"People often think of climate change mitigation in terms of sacrifices, but electric cars aren't a sacrifice at all - they're an improvement over what we're used to.\"\nTL;DR: The first minister has set a target for new petrol and diesel vehicles to be phased out in Scotland by 2032. Nicola Sturgeon made the announcement as part of her  programme for government  for 2017-18. More people are buying electric vehicles, but there are significant challenges ahead if we're to be weaned off the combustion engine completely.\n\nArticle: In experiments on worms, University of Cambridge researchers identified drugs which prevented the very first step towards brain cell death.\n\nThey now want to match up drugs with specific stages of the disease.\n\nExperts said it was important to find out if these drugs could work safely in humans.\n\nStatins are taken by people to reduce the risk of developing heart disease and the Cambridge research team says its work may have unearthed a potential\"neurostatin\"to ward off Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGenetically programmed worms\n\nRather than treating the symptoms of the disease, a neurostatin could be used as a preventative measure to stop the condition appearing in the first place.\n\nThe cancer drug bexarotene, for example, was found to stop the first step which leads to the death of brain cells in worms genetically programmed to develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn previous trials in humans, researchers tested the drug at a later stage of the disease to see if it would clear amyloid plaques from the brain but the trials were unsuccessful.\n\nDr Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said scientists must find out exactly how the drug works before any clinical trials.\n\n\"We will now need to see whether this new preventative approach could halt the earliest biological events in Alzheimer's and keep damage at bay in further animal and human studies.\n\n\"This early research in worms suggests that bexarotene could act earlier in the process to interfere with amyloid build-up.\"\n\nDefences'overwhelmed'\n\nWriting in Science Advances, Prof Michele Vendruscolo, senior study author from the University of Cambridge, said the research team wanted to find out more about the mechanics of every stage of the disease's development.\n\n\"The body has a variety of natural defences to protect itself against neurodegeneration, but as we age, these defences become progressively impaired and can get overwhelmed.\n\n\"By understanding how these natural defences work, we might be able to support them by designing drugs that behave in similar ways.\"\n\nDr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society, said it was still early days.\n\n\"Bexarotene has many side-effects when used to treat lymphoma, such as skin complaints, headaches, and sickness, and we would also need to be sure that it's safe for people with Alzheimer's to take.\n\n\"We haven't found any new drugs for dementia in over 10 years, and repurposing drugs that already work for other conditions could provide us with a shortcut to new dementia treatments.\"\nTL;DR:",

He suffered from motor neurone disease.\n\nEncouraged\n\nThe family of a female cancer patient also complained to the trust about their mother's treatment. She died before being admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital's admissions ward in January.   \n\nIn response, Edwin Poots said in April, he would be introducing the special measures to ensure greater accountability within the Belfast trust.\n\nAddressing the trust board, the chief executive, Colm Donaghy said following a meeting with the department's permanent secretary and the Chief Medical Officer he was encouraged that the measures would be lifted. \n\n\"Depending on the minister having confidence to do that - the special measures could be lifted as soon as possible - perhaps in July.\"\n\nAnother meeting is scheduled with the Department of Health on the 12 June.   \n\nMr Donaghy said that he had asked staff to look on the special measures as an opportunity to reassure patients, clients and their families that the trust is delivering a safe, good quality service. \n\nHe acknowledged that there had been some very sad outcomes for some patients. \n\nLack of communication\n\n\"The vast majority of those in the trust's care received a service that compares very well with other parts of the UK.\"\n\nAn independent review into the pseudomonas outbreak, said the Belfast Health Trust should have declared it sooner and criticised a lack of communication between health officials across the health service. \n\nIn April, Mr Poots said:\"The trust will be asked to draw up an action plan specifically focused on those areas where I have been concerned, and I will expect the trust to report on progress against this plan regularly to my department.\"\n\nThis will include the implementation of recommendations which come from the interim report of the Independent Review of Incidents of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infection in Neonatal units in Northern Ireland.\n\nFor the first time, the special measures were recognised as the minister calling for greater accountability within the health service. \n\nMr Donaghy told the Trust Board that the first 15 recommendations of the interim report have now been fully implemented.  Meanwhile the trust is putting together a robust action plan with regards to the other 17 recommendations within the final report. \n\nAdvice\n\nMeanwhile a report into the deaths of the two patients awaiting admission highlights a number of failings.  \n\nThe trust's medical director, Dr Tony Stevens said a number of lessons had been learned including ensuring that senior medical staff are available late in the evening to ensure junior staff have support. \n\nAs reported by the BBC shortly after the 77 year old man's death - an autopsy wasn't carried out. \n\nTony Stevens told the trust's board, that management was now taking advice from the coroner about how best to contact the office when a death within the emergency department takes place. \n\nThe trust has also been advised to improve how they communicate information to the families.\n\nRecord keeping should also be tackled to ensure that relevant information is included in handovers between shifts.\nTL;DR: The chief executive of the Belfast Health Trust says he's optimistic that special measures will be lifted in July.  \n\n\n\nArticle: By Pauline McLeanBBC Scotland arts correspondent\n\nBut these aren't normal times.\n\nInstead, both festivals have been consulting with the Scottish government, City of Edinburgh Council, venues, partners and stakeholders to decide what, if any, of their 2020 programmes can go ahead.\n\nA pan-festival announcement - involving the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival and the Edinburgh Military Tattoo - is expected this week. \n\nIt's likely to involve a scaled-down version of events, rather than complete cancellation. Digital performances, if possible, from international participants. Local organisations could be prepared to stage work at relatively short notice. \n\nThe original Edinburgh International Festival was staged in 1947, in the wake of World War Two. Rationing was still in force, and locals apparently donated their coal to allow Edinburgh Castle to be lit at night.\n\nThe Fringe was born the same year when eight theatre companies, who hadn't been invited to the official festival, decided to stage their shows anyway.\n\nSomething of that same spirit may be required this year. \n\nAs an open access festival, the Fringe can't be cancelled in the same way as the international festival. \n\nThe Fringe Society can only advise on access and if authorities at a future date decide that's it's safe, some performers could still stage shows. Others may contribute from a distance. \n\nFor those who have long complained that the Fringe has lost sight of its humble roots and become a sprawling, commercial beast, it could be a good chance to return to that original idea that the festivals provide\"a platform for the flowering of the human spirit\".\n\nA much more fluid, ad hoc, smaller festival than the ones of late, but a celebration nonetheless - and in these strange and abnormal times, that has never been more needed.\nTL;DR: In normal times, the Edinburgh International Festival would have launched its 2020 programme and the Edinburgh Fringe would be compiling its own telephone directory-sized schedule for the 50,000-plus performances due to be staged in the city this summer.\n\nArticle: Beer gardens reopened on Monday - along with hairdressers and barbers, for the first time since social-distancing measures were brought in at the end of March.\n\nAs the levels of virus spreading through the community have reduced, the Welsh Government has moved to lift more restrictions, including introducing\"extended households\".\n\nWhat is an extended household?\n\nAn extended household is the how the Welsh Government has introduced what is known in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland as\"support bubbles\"- an idea first introduced in New Zealand.\n\nIt is designed to help families reunite and help support those with care needs.\n\nA household means a group of the same people all sharing the same home. It could be a family living together, flatmates in the same property, or even individuals renting rooms in the same house.\n\nThere is no restriction on the number of people in a household - as long as they are always the same people.\n\nAn extended household is when two of those households come together as one.\n\nFor example, two grandparents could agree to become part of an extended household with their daughter and her partner and children.\n\nThe two households could then visit each other as much as they wish, go indoors, and even stay overnight.\n\nWhere's the catch?\n\nThere are restrictions - and it could mean some tough choices for individuals.\n\nThe main rule is this: Once you join an extended household - you cannot join another.\n\nIf it is our grandparents enjoying Sunday lunch with their daughter and grandchildren at the family home, those same grandparents cannot then decide they want to join with another family member next week.\n\nThey cannot decide they are ditching the daughter for their favourite son. \n\nOnce you are in a extended household, there is no swapping members - you have to stick with your original choice.\n\nAnd a word of warning: If one person in your extended household develops Covid-19 symptoms, every member of that extended household will be asked to self-isolate.\n\nWhat if we share custody of a child?\n\nThere are always exceptions to the rule - and this is one of them. \n\nIf your child divides their time between two homes they can be a member of extended families in both homes.\n\nBut I live in a shared house? \n\nIn this case, where several people are renting separate rooms in a single property they do not have to form a single household themselves - and they can join other extended households. \n\nOf course, where you may be sharing bathrooms and kitchens in a multiple-occupancy house, the Welsh Government points out it will increase the risk of spreading coronavirus - so they suggest have a good think and conversations with your housemates first.\n\nIs there a limit to the number of people in extended households?\n\nNo, there is no limit. But again, you cannot swap people in or out. Once they are in, they are in.\n\nI am in an extended household. Who else can I meet - and where?\n\nNo more than two households can get together - and then they have to meet outside.\n\nIt is exactly the same for extended households. \n\nTwo extended households can meet - but they have to meet outside, and the two groups should also observe social-distancing rules.\n\nTwo families - our grandparents and their son or daughter, for example, who are in a single extended household - can meet another extended family household - perhaps their other son or daughter and their in-laws who have decided to bubble together.\n\nBut it must be outdoors. \n\nIs there a limit on the number of people in extended households getting together?\n\nAs long as it is only two extended households coming together, there is no limit on numbers of people - as there is no limit on the size of a single extended household.\n\nAgain, it has to be outside, and separate households should remain socially distanced.\n\nSo yes, if you want to have a barbecue with your extended household and your neighbour's extended household you can - if you want.\n\nCan I meet more than one extended household at a time?\n\nNo, you cannot. Only two households can come together at once. \n\nYour neighbour's friends cannot tag along to that barbecue in the back garden - sorry.\n\nCould I meet my friends in the pub then instead?\n\nYou cannot meet in the pub just yet - indoor cafes, bars and restaurants in Wales remain closed until 3 August.\n\nBut the same cannot be said for pub beer gardens.\n\nOutdoor parts of pubs and restaurants could open in Wales from 13 July.\n\nThe latest regulations allow gatherings of\"no more than 30 persons\"- as long as it has been organised by:\n\nOf course, all those groups also have to meet strict health and safety rules before they can open their doors to you and your mates. \n\nDon't expect it to be a\"normal\"pint out.\n\nWhat else can I do?\n\nIf it is not a beer or a meal you are after there are now plenty more things you can do in your extended household.\n\nSelf-contained holiday accommodation is open for business and bookings across Wales, with all travel restrictions lifted.\n\nWhile they may be thinking about some sun worshipping - with Welsh weather, they may need a prayer or two.\n\nAnd you'd be in luck there too - as faith leaders are also preparing to welcome back congregations from this week.\n\nFun in the sun\n\nOutdoor exercise classes, team games such as cricket and sports clubs can meet again. \n\nFrom Monday 20 July, there will be some playground relief for your youngsters during the summer holidays as they are allowed to reopen.\n\nAlso opening on Monday are community centres, outdoor gyms, and funfairs.\n\nThe great outdoors beckon on 25 July when campsites will be allowed to reopen.\n\nStay indoors?\n\nOn 27 July, cinemas, museums and galleries in Wales will be allowed to open their doors once more.\n\nYou will also be able to get a beauty salon pamper - and if you've the urge for ink, tattoo parlours are opening again.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nA reminder from the First Minister Mark Drakeford himself:\"We could find our hard work quickly undone unless we all go on playing our part, every day, and in every way we can, to keep Wales safe.\n\n\"It is not over.

They are both Christian.\n\n\"We started to consider adoption about two years ago,\"she said.\"When we telephoned the local authority to make initial inquiries we were turned down straight away.\n\n\"We were told they wouldn't have any children suitable. We could only adopt Indian or part-Indian Christian children - and there aren't very many of them.\"\n\nThe couple then contacted two other local authorities and three agencies. Each time they were told their ethnicity would be a barrier to adoption.\n\n\"A social worker told us adoption was a competitive marketplace and you had to market yourself. \n\n\"We had thought we brought with us a lot of positives because of our diversity, but our ethnicity was seen as a barrier.\"\n\nA year ago, after the government announced it was removing some barriers to adoption, the couple tried again - but got the same response.\n\nSo they decided to adopt from India.\"I have just returned with our little girl,\"she said. They don't know her religious background.\n\n\"We are extremely lucky because we are able to have a little family now, but we are also sad because we would have loved to have adopted a child here and we didn't have that opportunity.\n\n\"We will go on and have a very nice life, but there will be a child who stays in the care system. And that's very, very, very sad.\"\n\nTrying to adopt\n\nRebecca and her partner Graham recently went through the initial stages of adoption, to be told a month ago to come back in two years.  \n\n\"We are both in our mid 30s, have good jobs, a nice house and are willing to take on siblings.\n\n\"But were told that because we had only been together for three years (even though we have known each other for 12), and the fact that we could have our own birth children, was a problem. \n\n\"We were extremely upset by these comments as this is something as a woman I have thought long and hard about over the last few years.  \n\n\"They questioned our motivation. But I have never wanted to have my own children. We don't want to have a baby, but we do want to be parents. We would like to take on older children.\n\n\"We have since moved out of London to be closer to some of my family and are going to go through the process again with a different council and hopefully will be more successful.\n\n\"We are prepared to do this and to put the work in. But so far it feels like it's been'Thanks but no thanks'.\"\n\nSocial worker\n\nAmy Withers, a social worker in Birmingham, deals mostly with children going for adoption. \n\n\"In my experience, the court system sides with the parents and is not child-focused at all.\n\n\"It takes on average two years to get through a case from start to finish and that does not include waiting for a family finder to be allocated and then a family to be found for the children. \n\n\"This next process then takes, depending on when a family is found, at least another six months and the children still won't have been placed with their new family. \n\n\"The whole system is not child-friendly, never mind how the prospective adoptive parents feel about being interrogated. \n\n\"So much unnecessary time is wasted, and it's not down to the individual workers, it's the court system and the other processes that we have to follow. I personally know of two couples who wished to apply to adopt a child and they found the process far too long and daunting.\n\n\"The process to get to adoption can take very long. In April 2010 I removed a two-year-old and a one-year-old from their parents because of violent behaviour towards the children. \n\n\"I had to go to court for an order to keep the children in care and that case is still not finished and we're nearly at October 2011, nearly 18 months later. \n\n\"Until the court proceedings are finished we can't place the children with the right team to find them a family.\"\nTL;DR: Figures reveal adoption figures in England have fallen to a 10-year low, while the average length of time children wait to be adopted is now two years and seven months.  \n\n\n\nArticle: During Mr Trump's US presidential campaign, the agents exchanged texts calling him an\"idiot\"and\"awful\".\n\nThey were working on the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails at the time.\n\nBut Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he was confident the team was being run\"appropriately\".\n\nThe content of the text messages was released to the US Congress on Tuesday, and details have been obtained by US media.\n\nIn them Peter Strzok, a senior FBI agent, said Mrs Clinton\"just had to win\".\n\nLisa Page, an FBI lawyer, called Mr Trump a\"loathsome human\".\n\nRepublican Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the congressional judiciary committee, said the texts showed\"extreme bias\"against Mr Trump, made worse by the fact that they went on to work on Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and if Trump campaign figures were complicit.\n\nThey were\"investigating the very person for whom they were showing disdain,\"Mr Goodlatte said.\n\nMr Rosenstein responded that the FBI had rules against checking a person's politics during the hiring process.\n\n\"We are not going to improperly consider political affiliation with our career employees,\"he said.\n\nHe also said Mr Mueller was\"running that office appropriately\". When asked did he think there was good cause to fire Mr Mueller, he replied;\"No.\"\n\nThe messages came into the public domain because the justice department is investigating the FBI's handling of its inquiry into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.\n\nThe text messages have been known to exist since it emerged earlier this month that in the summer Mr Strzok had been removed from the special counsel investigation into alleged Russian interference in Mr Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nMr Trump has previously tweeted about Mr Strzok, calling him\"tainted (no, very dishonest?)\".\n\nMr Strzok now works in human resources at the FBI. Ms Page also spent some time on the special counsel investigation but returned to her normal duties before the existence of the text messages was made public.\n\nIn other messages, as reported in the US press:\n\nUnder FBI regulations, agents may express political opinions\"as an individual\". It is not clear whether these texts were sent from work phones.\nTL;DR: Republicans have said text messages sent between two FBI agents who later joined a special counsel team investigating Mr Trump's campaign show that investigation is biased.\n\nArticle: By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter\n\nThe Windrush scandal dominated, leading to some of the most explosive exchanges yet between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn a pre-emptive strike, the prime minister went straight into an apology for the\"confusion and anxiety\"caused to the children of first generation Commonwealth immigrants threatened with deportation because they haven't got the right paperwork.\n\nResponding to a planted question from a Tory MP, she said:\"These people are British. They are part of us.\"She repeated her pledge that no one with the right to be in the UK would be deported.\n\nJeremy Corbyn referred back to a case he had raised a month ago at Prime Minister's Questions - that of Albert Thompson, a man who had been denied NHS cancer treatment he was entitled to because he did not have the right documentation. He accused Mrs May of\"brushing it off\".\n\nThe Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, said Mrs May, and his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. She suggested Mr Thompson was not part of the Windrush generation.\n\nThen it was on to the landing cards - documents that could have shown when Commonwealth citizens arrived in the UK - that were destroyed by the UK Border Agency during an office move in 2010.\n\nMr Corbyn tried to pin the decision on Mrs May who was home secretary in 2010 when it was thought to have been taken. Not so, said Mrs May,\"the decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009 under a Labour government\". \n\nThis was news to Mr Corbyn and everybody else (Labour's Jacqui Smith and then Alan Johnson were the home secretaries during the year in question and they have both said they can't remember anything about it).\n\nThe Labour leader switched to an attack on the\"hostile environment\"for illegal immigrants that was created by Home Secretary May, in 2014, which he said had led to the current Windrush debacle. \n\nHe then swung back round on to the landing cards, suggesting again Mrs May had been responsible and saying Parliament needed\"absolute clarity\"on when the decision was taken. It was in 2009, Mrs May told him.\n\nThe prime minister - perhaps sensing that she had got one over on Mr Corbyn - then ventured into a defence of her crackdown on illegal immigration, saying it was\"absolutely right\"that only people entitled to use public services used them.\n\n\"This isn't about illegal immigration,\"said Mr Corbyn, but about Commonwealth citizens\"who have a right to be here\". He asked how many people from the Windrush generation have been deported.\n\nMr Corbyn said he had just received information that Albert Thompson had still not been told when he will get the treatment he needs.\n\nShouting across the despatch box as the noise levels from MPs rose, Mr Corbyn said the responsibility for the Windrush debacle\"lies firmly at the prime minister's door\"because of her\"pandering to bogus immigration targets\"when she was home secretary, which he said had led to a\"hostile environment\"and British citizens\"thrown into detention centres like criminals\".\n\nHe said the Windrush generation came to the UK after the war to help rebuild the country, and claimed Mrs May's government was both\"heartless and hopeless\"and\"callous and incompetent\".\n\nTheresa May agreed that the Windrush generation\"did help to build our country, they are British\"which was why the government was working to ensure they could prove their status.\n\nShe then took an angry swipe at Mr Corbyn over allegations of anti-Semitism aired by some of his own MPs in an emotional Commons debate on Tuesday.\n\n\"He talks about being callous, I will not take that from a man who allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party.\"\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's Leader at Westminster Ian Blackford zeroed in on Esther McVey, who sparked controversy on Monday by describing the so-called\"rape clause\"in Universal Credit as an opportunity for victims to get help. Did the PM agree with the work pension secretary?\n\nEllie Reeves, Labour MP for  Lewisham West and Penge, asked if the rise in violent crime in London was down to police cuts.\n\nThe Verdicts\n\nHere's what the BBC's Andrew Neil and Laura Kuenssberg made of it:\n\nAnd here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on it:\n\nThat was just about as bitter a PMQs exchange as Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have had.\n\nThe PM was accused of pandering to fears about immigration and creating a Home Office that was\"heartless and hopeless\". But the PM was prepared.\n\nA critical detail in the Windrush saga is the destruction of critical immigration records - and she said that decision was taken under a Labour government.\n\nIt was a point of detail which tripped the Labour leader up - and his voice increasingly had that edge of anger that creeps in in pressure situations.\n\nThe PM had, courtesy of a former special advisor, Neil O'Brien, already taken the opportunity to lay out her position before Mr Corbyn rose - and she didn't give an inch, in the face of intense attack in an unruly House.\n\nAnd her lashback about Labour's internal battle over anti-Semitism delighted her side.\n\nCornered on unfavourable ground, the PM won this exchange - although Jeremy Corbyn's succession of pointed phrases are doubtless already running on Facebook, and will play well with his target voters.\n\nThe Speaker intervened several times to quieten the House and rebuke hecklers - at one point complaining of\"stupid\"behaviour. Although he didn't name the miscreants. The atmosphere was poisonous - and with the political temperature rising, it will probably continue to curdle.\n\nNo-one expects sugary matiness at PMQs, but this kind of mutual contempt is corrosive.\n\nPredictably (although I failed to predict it) there were plenty of questions pegged to the Commonwealth summit, taking place a short distance away.\n\nNigel Evans raised the issue of gay rights in Commonwealth countries, Stella Creasey complained about an extradition case.\n\nAnd in 40 minutes, no-one mentioned Brexit.\n\nWhat pundits are saying on Twitter\n\nAnd finally, for podcast fans\nTL;DR: Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened.\n\nArticle: HMS Ganges at Shotley Gate was last used as a police training base until 2001.\n\nGalliard Homes has been granted planning permission to develop the site by Babergh District Council.\n\nThe plans also include a hotel, a 60 bed nursing home, retail and commercial units and a commitment to restore the listed ceremonial mast.\n\nThe site had been the subject of 16 planning applications since 2001, including many smaller ones which were approved but not implemented.\n\nAn application for 325 homes was turned down by the government in 2006.\n\n'Homes and jobs'\n\nSeveral parish councils raised objections that the latest plan would create too much extra traffic on the B1456 to Ipswich.\n\nCouncillor Peter Beer, chairman of Babergh's development committee, said he was\"confident the impact on the environment, heritage and ecology could be minimised, whilst creating new homes and jobs\".\n\n\"We took the concerns about traffic to heart and the county's highways department decided the development was acceptable.\n\n\"The application retains many of the existing buildings and the mast, which is a real landmark and nearly beyond repair, will get re-instated which is great news.\"\n\nGalliard Homes will provide investment in community facilities, including \u00a3437,000 for local education and \u00a383,980 for health services, as part of the development.\n\nThe council said the approval also committed Galliard to provide funding to look at improving the foot ferry service to Harwich and Felixstowe and local cycle routes and restoring the base's indoor swimming pool.\nTL;DR: Plans for a 285 home development have been approved for a derelict former naval base in Suffolk.\n\nArticle: The measures, which target Russia's top spy and six others, are being co-ordinated with similar moves by the European Union.\n\nUS officials said intelligence had concluded that the Moscow government was behind the near-fatal nerve agent attack on Navalny last year.\n\nHe is the most high-profile critic of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMoscow denies involvement in his poisoning and disputes the conclusion, by Western weapons experts, that Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok agent during a flight in Siberia.\n\nThe term Novichok -\"newcomer\"in Russian - applies to a group of nerve agents developed in a lab by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

She was 14 and was on her way to a lake not far from her home. \n\nIt was to be a special occasion. She had been asked to help teach a group of younger children how to sail. \n\nIn fact, for Elsie Frost, everything must have seemed rather special at that time.  She had some good friends, had just become a member of the local youth club and had been chosen to be the next head girl at her school. Life was getting really good.\n\nElsie was wearing a yellow woollen sweater, a white blouse and printed cotton skirt. \n\nBefore leaving her family's semi-detatched home in Wakefield, she sat down to put on her brand new pair of shoes. \n\nMaybe she checked outside to see if it was cold because she also wrapped herself up in her favourite red, quilted anorak, which had been bought for her by an aunt. Her sailing clothes were in a duffle bag, which she carried over her shoulder.   \n\nPeople who knew her were later to say that she had seemed very happy.\n\nSeven hours later, Elsie Frost's body was lying in Wakefield Public Mortuary being examined by a pathologist. Her white blouse, yellow sweater and favourite red coat were soaked in blood. She had been stabbed several times. \n\nHer father had to identify her body. It was Saturday 9 October 1965.\n\nElsie's murder dominated the headlines. By the following morning, newspaper journalists had managed to track down her elder sister Anne. She was 18 and was living a few miles away with her husband and son. \n\nBy then, Anne's parents were in her house. They had been sedated and were lying down in her bedroom. Some of the reporters were on the\"verge of aggressiveness\", Anne recalls. Had a policewoman not been with her, she adds, she would not have been able to cope. \n\nElsie's younger brother, Colin, had first been taken to stay with some neighbours and then to an uncle's house. He was six years old. He remembers still being up on the Monday night when ITN News came on. The first image he saw was Elsie's face. His uncle leapt out of his chair, scooped him up and\"zoomed\"him up the stairs. Colin has no memory of the time after that point. \n\nThe police investigation was huge. Scotland Yard detectives were drafted in to help the local forces in Yorkshire. According to a senior police officer at the time, thousands of people were interviewed and more than 1,200 written statements were taken. \n\nFour hundred people, who lived within a quarter of a mile of the murder, were traced and their movements checked. A large number of knives were taken and examined but it was not thought that the murder weapon was among them.  \n\nThe police were unable to establish any\"apparent reason or motive for the attack\"and did not know whether\"she was the intended victim or merely passing at the time\".  No one was traced\"with the slightest animosity against the girl\". There was no evidence of a sexual assault and no sign of her having been robbed. \n\nNo-one was ever convicted of her murder.\n\nPrecisely 49 years and 14 days later, Elsie's sister Anne sat down at her computer and typed an email to the BBC. She wrote:\"Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the murder of my 14-year-old sister. The perpetrator has never been brought to justice and I feel sad about that.\" \n\nAnne's sadness had not lessened as the years passed. To some extent, she had to keep her thoughts bottled up because she could not discuss the murder in front of her father. Arthur found it too upsetting.\"He even found it difficult to talk about her and in fact we never did,\"Anne remembers. \n\nArthur could not even bring himself to look at photographs of Elsie. When Anne's parents died - Edith in 1988 and Arthur in 2003 - they both\"went to their graves\u2026 feeling hugely guilty\"because\"they didn't know what had happened to their daughter\", Anne says.  \n\nAnne is determined that she and her brother Colin will not have\"that same kind of guilt that mum and dad had\".\n\nAs a result of the email, Anne and Colin were interviewed on BBC Radio 4's iPM programme. They told their story and that of their murdered sister. The interview lasted around 19 minutes but can be summed up by 13 words spoken by Anne:\n\n\"Why? Why did it happen? On a Saturday afternoon at half past four?\"\n\nOn 11 January 1966, around three months after the murder, an inquest jury thought it knew who had killed Elsie. These days an inquest's role is only to establish certain facts and the cause of a death. In 1966, an inquest could actually accuse a man of murder. And that is what happened at the inquest into the death of Elsie.\n\nOn the morning of 12 January, the Guardian's headline was:\"Coroner sends man for trial on murder charge.\"The Mirror summed it up with the words:\"Elsie: Man accused of murder.\"\n\nThe man was Ian Spencer, who had appeared at the inquest as a witness. The unanimous verdict of the jury was that Elsie Frost had been murdered and\"that there is a prima facie case against Ian Bernard Spencer\"- effectively accusing him of the crime.\n\nDescribed in different reports as a former railway fireman and as a labourer, he was 33 and married with a son. \n\nHe had appeared as a witness at the inquest because he had been in the area of the murder on the same afternoon but he was insistent that he was at home quite some time before Elsie was killed. His wife, mother-in-law and a family friend said they were able to confirm that but they were not called by the coroner to speak at the inquest. \n\nSome of the witnesses who were called contradicted that story and claimed they thought they saw him close to the area where Elsie's body was found.\n\nIan Spencer was committed to face trial. He spent eight weeks and two days in prison. \n\nIn March 1966 he was cleared. A magistrates' court had already concluded there was no case to answer and a judge at the equivalent of the modern crown court instructed the jury to find him\"not guilty\".\n\nElsie's mother Edith told newspapers:\"I know what Mr Spencer and his wife must have suffered, I am glad for their sakes it is over. I am sure they will be as anxious as I am to have the killer found.\" \n\nOne of the people I spoke to over the past few months was Ian Spencer's son, Lee. His father is now in a care home and unable to communicate, after suffering a severe stroke, but Lee was keen to speak on his father's behalf. Lee has a series of his father's notebooks. Opening one at random, it listed places he had been, times and his mileage.\n\nEvery day, every week, every month, year after year, he wrote down everything - the moment he left, the moment he arrived and the moment he returned, wherever he went. \n\nHe did this throughout his working life and continued when he retired.\n\nFinding the log books in his father's house was tough for Lee.\"It's difficult to think that you've got to write this down, day after day,\"he says. \n\n\"He started logging things because of what people had said,\"says Ian Spencer's cousin, Brian Orange.\n\nAt various times during the following years, when there were other murders, the police would arrive at the family home to ask where Lee's father had been when those crimes had been committed. That still angers the family. They believe it was deeply unfair because he had been cleared by two courts. \n\nBrian thinks it is likely that the police visits were one of the reasons his cousin started logging his life.  \n\n\"With the police keeping coming back, he had it in his mind that he would need to be able to say, well, I left home, I went to work. He wanted a safeguard for himself.\"\n\nDespite his acquittal, what happened\"never left him over the last 50 years\", as Lee puts it. \n\nAt every turn in reporting this story, I have found people whose lives have been permanently affected by what happened.\n\nLet us return to Anne's questions. We were left with the knowledge that a teenager had been murdered and a man accused and acquitted of her killing. What though could we find out about the circumstances of Elsie's murder?\n\nI discovered all those details about what Elsie was wearing that day - the red coat, yellow jumper and brand new shoes - in the file from the inquest.\n\nOne of the most difficult days emotionally was when I took Colin to the coroner's office in Wakefield. Staff had kindly retrieved the relevant documents from the archives.  \n\nBefore getting there, Colin told me he would definitely like to know when his sister was killed. The family had thought she died at about 16:30. The file suggests it was earlier than that. \n\nThere is a letter on the coroner's headed paper, which seems to have been typed by or on behalf of the Coroner's Officer, Gerard Browne, at 13:00 on Sunday 10 October 1965. It confirms Elsie's name, address and age and where she was found. \n\nAt the bottom of the page, there are some\"special remarks\". They begin:\"Sir, the deceased girl was found [at] about 4.15pm, Saturday 9 October 1965.\"\n\nFor Colin, knowing this was important. And there was more in the file which was to be new to him. \n\nThe lake - or lagoon - where Elsie was sailing on the afternoon she died was known as the Horbury Sand Quarry. It is close to the River Calder, a canal and some railway lines. \n\nTo return home after sailing, Elsie would most likely have walked on a path which is not there anymore, fairly close to the railway. That area is now totally overgrown. There is another path, which is used now, closer to the canal. \n\nTo reach the other side of the railway, it is believed she headed for what is locally called the\"ABC tunnel\". There are then steps up a steep embankment. There are 26 of them, hence the\"ABC\". \n\nElsie's body was found by a man, Thomas Brown, who had been walking with his young children and their dog. \n\nHe told the inquest:\"When we got to within five or 10 yards of the bottom of the steps, I saw a girl lain there, whom I now know to be Elsie Frost. She was lying with her left arm on the second step and her head was lying on her left arm and her right arm was above her head on the next step. \n\n\"She was crouched up in an awkward position with her legs underneath her body in a kneeling type of position but more on her left hand side. I went up to her and asked her what was wrong and got my hands under her armpits and picked her up. \n\n\"When I spoke to her I did not get any reply. I did not realise she was as badly injured as she was. At this time, my son was at the top of the banking. I tried to persuade the children to go home but they wouldn't.\"\n\nThere are also details in the file about what Elsie was doing within the hour leading up to her death. The event that afternoon at the lagoon was organised by her school's sailing club. The teacher in charge, John Blackburn, told the inquest:\"I beckoned to Elsie and took her out in a boat to give her some instruction, as she had previously got into difficulties when navigating one of the boats. \n\n\"I was out with Elsie Frost in the boat until about five minutes to four.\"\n\nHe explained that Elsie had then helped him to pack the boats away before she left. Other children and another teacher then departed before Blackburn then left at about 16:20. If all the times in the inquest file are accurate, Elsie was killed between about 16:00 and 16:15. \n\nWhile the police never found out what happened during that time, there is a woman who thinks she knows. Her name is Janis Hirst. Back then, her surname was Dixon and she was a friend of Elsie's. \n\n\"When doing my nurse training, I was working at a hospital and got talking about Elsie on a shift we were on. And this nurse had said that she had worked in a hospital where a man had been brought in and he had confessed under drugs to being present at the murder of Elsie. \n\n\"He said that he was in the long grass with another man committing a homosexual act when Elsie had stumbled over them\u2026 and the other man had run off after Elsie and stabbed her. Elsie had caught them in the act and had run off screaming and he jumped Elsie and stabbed her.\"\n\nAccording to Janis, the other nurse said a doctor was also in the room to hear this\"confession\". They did not tell the police because\"whatever a patient tells you is strictly confidential and they couldn't break that confidentiality\"and also because the man was on medication at the time.\n\nThe nurse who Janis said told her all of this died some years ago. Janis says she was given names for the two men but we are not publishing those for obvious legal reasons. She says she is willing to speak to the police.\n\nJanis is confident that what she was told is true but, crucially, she was not there when the supposed confession happened. It is a third-hand story, so one which understandably does have to be treated with a high degree of caution. In legal terms, it would be considered as\"double hearsay\".\n\nI have heard another story along the same lines. According to the former MP for the area, David Hinchliffe, there was a rumour at the time that Elsie had been killed because she had stumbled upon what people described as\"homosexual activity\". It's worth bearing in mind that homosexual acts between men were illegal until 1967.\n\nOf course, when there is any unsolved murder, there will probably always be different stories going around about who might have been responsible. And most will probably not be true.\n\nOne of Anne's fears is that whoever was responsible might have gone on to attack others. A woman called Julie - she only wants us to use her first name - claims something happened to her in the same area nine years later. She was the same age as Elsie had been - 14. \n\n\"We'd bunked off school - me and my brother and his friend and had gone down the quarry,\"she says.\"We'd gone swimming. I was over at the jetty and I got jumped on by a man. He got me in the grass, got on top of me, his hand over my mouth, he slashed my shorts with his knife, he put the knife to my throat. My brother came along and his friend and chased him away.\"\n\nJulie says she did not go to the police\"because I should have been at school. I didn't even tell my mum\". Julie's brother says he remembers there being some kind of incident but does not remember the knife and is short on detail.\n\nIt will be the task of a new police investigation to assess the stories of people like Janis and Julie. It is happening as a result of what we have been doing and it is the first investigation into the murder since the 1960s.\n\n\"The reason why I've taken on this investigation is that I want justice for Elsie,\"says West Yorkshire Police's DCI Elizabeth Belton.\n\nShe is to launch an appeal for information and has not ruled out the possibility that the person responsible might actually come forward to\"clear their conscience and tell me that they've committed the murder and, more importantly, a reason why\".\n\nUnfortunately, DCI Belton will not be able re-examine all the evidence from the time. \n\nWe probably all have an image in our heads, fuelled by all those television dramas we have watched, of vast police storerooms, containing plastic bags full of potentially vital pieces of evidence going back decades. \n\nBut unsurprisingly the police officers in Wakefield in the mid-1960s did not anticipate the amazing scientific advances in DNA testing seen over the subsequent decades. In April 1966, just six months after the murder, some of Elsie's clothing was returned to her father and the rest was destroyed. None of it remains. There are no plastic bags of evidence awaiting the DNA expert. \n\nColin thinks of his sister every time he ties up his shoelaces. It was Elsie who taught him how to do it when he was a little boy. Fifty years after she was killed, she remains on people's minds and not only those of members of her family.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I met Elsie's friend, Janis Hirst, she showed me an old black and white school photograph. Janis is standing in the third row. Elsie is a few places along to her left. Both are grinning. \n\nLike Elsie, Janis was a member of their school's sailing club. In fact, she was meant to have been going sailing with her on the afternoon she died. They had arranged to meet at about 14:00 in order to walk to the lagoon together. But that did not happen. \n\nJanis did not turn up. Her mother was ill and she was sent to the shops instead. Her family did not have a telephone so she was unable to let Elsie know. If they had met up, they would almost certainly have left together too. That has haunted Janis ever since.\n\n\"I remember saying to two detectives who came to our house that if I'd had gone, it might not have happened because there'd have been two of us. And I remember them saying to me:'It could've been that we would have been investigating two deaths. It could've happened to both of you so don't ever think that it was because you weren't there that it happened.'\"\n\nBut that is exactly what has troubled Janis all of these years. As a result, she has written twice to Elsie\"to apologise for not being there that day to walk home with her\". She wrote the first letter when she was 16, the second when she was 40.\n\n\"I think it will always be that doubt in my mind,\"she says.\"There's always that little girl inside of me who thinks I should have been there and it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nFor Anne and Colin, the last few months have, at times, been very difficult. Anne says there were moments when she\"wanted it all to stop\". She had sleepless nights, and sometimes felt she\"might be sinking underneath it\"but says she needed to do something and that it had been worthwhile. After all, she says,\"this has been on my mind for 50 years\".\n\nAnne's main question remains unanswered. Why did it happen? \n\nThe family does now have the new police investigation to give them the hope that the answers will eventually come but Anne admits there is a big risk that she might be left feeling disappointed.\n\nWhen Colin went with me to the coroner's office in Wakefield, he came away with some of the details he wanted to know and with an image in his head. He says that helped. \n\n\"I feel inside actually closer to Elsie than I was. I can see Elsie's body, how it was dressed, the anorak, the shoes, the skirt, what she was carrying. The only thing that's missing on the body that I am picturing is I don't have her face.\"\n\nBut he says he would not want to see her face in that mental image.\n\nOn 9 October this year, half a century after she was killed, Elsie's life will be remembered in a special service at what used to be the family's local church in Wakefield. \n\nAnne says that when she is sitting in the church, she will be thinking about her sister, all the people who\"should have known her and who haven't known her\"and all those\"who have been affected [like] Janis [and] Mr Spencer. They will all be on my mind\". \n\nOn the same day, a tree will be planted in Elsie's memory at the crematorium where her funeral took place. There will be a plaque with some words her family has written: \n\nElsie is remembered by her family, friends and the community of Wakefield.\n\nForever loved, forever remembered.\n\n7 February 1951 - 9 October 1965.\n\nYou can listen to or download all the reports so far.\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: Fifty years ago, 14-year-old Elsie Frost was stabbed to death. A BBC investigation has now led to the police resuming their hunt for her killer.\n\nArticle: The emergency services were called to The Clock bar in Cambuslang at about 18:00 after customers became unwell amid reports of a\"chemical smell\".\n\nA specialist unit to contain chemical spills was sent to the scene in Main Street, along with three fire engines.\n\nThirteen properties were evacuated, including the pub and several homes.\n\nA Police Scotland spokesman said a number of people were checked over but had not suffered any lasting effects. \n\nSafety check\n\nGas engineers from Scotland's emergency gas response network SGN attended and isolated the gas supply to the pub, before performing a safety check on the property and surrounding area.\n\nA spokesman for The Clock bar said:\"The Clock had a carbon monoxide leak but it is suspected to have originated elsewhere. It has now been declared safe and has reopened.\n\n\"We don't know where it came from but we have taken extra steps to make sure our customers are safe.\"\n\nAn SGN spokesman said:\"A number of nearby properties were evacuated as a precaution but have now been reoccupied after we carried out a safety check.\"\n\nIt is understood during final checks engineers did not find any trace of carbon monoxide.\nTL;DR: More than a dozen homes and businesses in a South Lanarkshire town were evacuated on Sunday following a suspected carbon monoxide leak.\n\nArticle: By David ShukmanEnvironment & science correspondent, BBC News\n\nAn advance party has braved freezing temperatures to set up vital equipment and supplies at Lake Ellsworth.\n\nThe project by UK engineers to drill through the two-mile-thick ice-sheet is scheduled for the end of the year.\n\nThe aims are to search for signs of life in the waters and to extract sediments from the lake floor to better understand the past climate. \n\nIt is is one of the most challenging British scientific projects for years. \n\nThe task is so complex that preparations have had to be spread over two Antarctic summer seasons. \n\nIn the first phase a\"tractor train\"has just hauled nearly 70 tonnes of equipment from an ice runway at Union Glacier through the Ellsworth mountains to the lake site. \n\nThe journey of about 250km (155 miles) involved crossing a mix of deep snow and rock-hard ice and took three days. \n\nOnce there, a four-man team stored the equipment and\"winterised\"it to cope with the incredibly low temperatures to come. \n\nWind-blown snow is expected to partially cover the gear but GPS markers fixed to the corners of the site will help locate it again. \n\nThe area around Lake Ellsworth is notorious for its deep cold and constant winds. \n\nLake Ellsworth is one of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica and was chosen for the drilling operation because of its relative accessibility. \n\nOne of the advance team, Andy Tait of the British Antarctic Survey, now back in the UK, told me about the sheer difficultly of conditions.\n\n\"The maximum summer temperature is minus 20 and with a wind of something like 30 knots you can imagine the cold.\n\n\"It is really harsh and working there with equipment means you have to use thin gloves - it is really cold.\"\n\nBut the delivery of equipment is just one part of the preparations for the drilling and sampling operation. \n\nKey components are still being manufactured and tested before they can be shipped south. \n\nMost challenging is the complex sampling probe which has been designed to cope with a combination of extremely high pressures and extremely low temperatures. \n\nIt must also be assembled and delivered in conditions of the highest possible sterility.\n\nFor the first time in Antarctic exploration, an investigation is being planned with cleanliness standards higher than those of most surgeries.\n\nBecause one of the key aims is to search for signs of biology in the lake waters - one of the most tantalising questions - all possibility of contamination has to be eliminated. \n\nI watched as one team worked in a clean room at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.\n\nEach hi-tech component - including the titanium sampling bottles and specially-engineered filters - has to be sterilised.\n\nAnd the final assembly of the 5.5m probe will take place inside a unique\"tent\"accessed by gloved inlets along its sides.\n\nThis November, the second phase of shipments will take place and the operation will begin in earnest.\n\nThe drilling will be carried out by a system using hot water and is expected to take three days.\n\nOnce the bore-hole is open providing access to the lake beneath the ice, the team will then have 24 hours in which to lower the sampling devices.\n\nComputer modelling indicates that the hole will then start to re-freeze making it impossible to use.\n\nThe plan is to first lower the water sampling probe - a process that should take an hour - and then a corer to extract lake sediment. \n\nAccording to Andy Tait, all eyes will be on the weather. Although many stages of the operation can be handled under cover, ideally conditions will be calm when the drilling starts.\n\nThe engineering, the planning, the science are impressively thorough - but Antarctica is the most challenging place on earth in which to work, and outcomes can never be certain.\nTL;DR: An ambitious plan to explore a vast lake trapped beneath the Antarctic ice is a step closer to becoming reality.\n\nArticle: Police were called to St Mark's West Essex Catholic School in Harlow on Thursday following reports that eight girls had taken a Class B drug.\n\nThe teenager was arrested on suspicion of having drugs with intent to supply and released under investigation.\n\nAll affected pupils had been discharged from hospital, the school confirmed.\n\nIn a statement, it said:\"On Thursday 28 February, a pupil brought a substance into school. Subsequently, a small number of pupils felt unwell and notified school staff.\n\n\"They were taken to hospital as a precaution. All were discharged the same day without need for further medical attention.\n\n\"This unprecedented incident was dealt with quickly and efficiently, in accordance with health and safety procedures. The safety of pupils was paramount at all times.\"\n\nThe school confirmed that the parents of the pupils involved had been\"fully supportive\"of the way the matter was handled.\n\nIt also said a full investigation into the incident will now take place.\nTL;DR: A 13-year-old schoolgirl has been arrested on suspicion of dealing drugs to fellow pupils after a number of them needed hospital treatment.\n\nArticle: Young turnout in mid-term elections in the US is historically low but some signs, including participation in recent primaries and voter registration, suggest that numbers may be higher this year. \n\nAt the same time, however, other data indicate that very little may change. \n\nLet's take a look at key factors. \n\n1. Millennials are more politically engaged\n\nA survey of people aged 22 to 38 found that 62% were\"looking forward\"to the vote on 6 November, a large increase from the 46% recorded in 2014 and 39% in 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nRecent special and primary elections had higher turnout than previous years fuelled, in part, by greater participation of young voters, says Dr Michael McDonald, an associate professor of Political Science at the University of Florida. \n\nHe runs the United States Elections Project, which has election data from as far back as 1787.\n\nEarly signs suggest that this could happen again next month.\n\n\"You do expect young voters to be more engaged in this election than in recent [ones],\"according to Dr McDonald.\n\nHealth care, immigration and the economy are some of the most important issues for them, according to surveys, and they tend to engage more with candidates addressing those subjects.\n\n2. But they usually don't bother to actually vote\n\nDespite all of the above, don't forget that young turnout in mid-term elections is historically low, hovering around 20%. They are also the age group most likely to not vote. \n\nThere have been some initiatives to change that. Apart from calls from politicians and celebrities (more on that later), more than 100 companies - including Walmart, the country's largest employer - have joined the campaign Time to Vote.\n\nThe goal is to boost participation among their employees, many of them young voters - a different Pew survey suggested that conflicting work or school schedule was a reason for a third of those interviewed to miss voting.\n\nLyft and Uber, for example, are offering discount or even free rides for some voters. \n\n\"People vote when they're interested,\"Dr McDonald says.\n\n\"The issues have to matter to the voters in order for them to be engaged and young people, because they haven't been exposed to politics for as long, don't have strong attachments or aren't following politics as close as older people.\"\n\nHow to register\n\n3. Politics has been, well, depressing\n\nAnd deeply partisan. And polarised. All of this could either encourage young people to vote or contribute to keep them away from the process.\n\nA poll by MTV/AP-Norc in July with people aged 15-34 suggested that:\n\nThat pessimism, however, can actually boost participation, says Dr McDonald. \n\n\"Anger is a very potent emotion that can motivate people to participate in elections. Negativity doesn't necessarily have a negative impact. It can turn some people off... but it energises [many].\"\n\nIn 2013, Steven Olikara founded the non-partisan group Millennial Action Project to encourage bipartisan dialogue among young legislators. He said one of their top priorities is to take the\"legislative process into the digital age,\"where much of the debate happens, and\"making government more transparent.\"\n\nWriting at the website Salon, he adds:\"Beyond writing legislation, young elected officials are chipping away at political dysfunction by engaging in constructive, civil discourse.\"\n\n4. Activism after Parkland\n\nThe movement for gun control created by the survivors of February's high-school shooting in Parkland, Florida, raised hopes of more political youth engagement. \n\nThere are mixed conclusions on that. Based on information available from 46 states, Target Smart, a Democratic political analytics firm, said there was an increase of 2.16% in registrations of 18-29 year olds nationwide following the shooting that left 17 students and workers dead.\n\nSome states with critical elections had significant increases, like Pennsylvania (10 point rise), Arizona (7.6) and Florida (7.9). \n\n\"The spike in voter registration activity comes on the heels of the grassroots movement to address gun violence issues,\"they said.\n\nBut a Washington Post analysis of data tracked by Aristotle Inc found almost no change in registration numbers on that age group. Even in Florida.\n\n5. The celebrity effect\n\nOr is there one?\n\nFirst, there was Taylor Swift. \n\nCiting events in\"the past two years\", the singer endorsed two Democrats in her home state, Tennessee, to her 112 million followers on Instagram last weekend. The post itself was liked by more than 1.6 million people.\n\nVote.org's Kamari Guthrie was quoted by Buzzfeed News as saying the site had seen a\"registrations spike\"in the state and also a bump in registration nationwide following the singer's post in the popular photo-sharing platform. \n\n\"Thank God for Taylor Swift,\"Ms Guthrie reportedly said.\n\nThe singer's announcement came ahead of a registration deadline in Tennessee and other states, when numbers usually go up, so it is difficult to say with certainty that the Swift effect is behind the rise.\n\nMs Guthrie, however, told the New York Times she had\"never seen a 24- or 36- or 48-hour period like this\"since Vote.org was created, in 2016. And many of those who registered were young people, she said.\n\nThe impact of famous people backing political candidates or causes is debated.\n\nSome experts say there is no concrete evidence that celebrities' endorsements or positions have a significant impact on voters. \n\nIn any case, Rihanna, Kanye West and others have also made their political feelings publicly known.\nTL;DR: This election has been billed as one in which young people form a powerful voting bloc, propelled by the momentum generated by school shootings earlier in the year, and mobilised by celebrities like Taylor Swift and Rihanna. But will they turn up on the day?\n\nArticle: Malalai Joya, an MP currently suspended from the Afghan parliament said that women in Afghanistan are still suffering same\n                  fate as they were under Taleban regime.\n               \n\n\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BBC Sandeshaya after receiving the 2008 Anna Politkovskaya award for her courageous campaign\n                  against the warlords in Afghanistan, she said Afghanistan women are currently caught between two powerful enemies.\n               \n\n\n\n\nThe award is organized by RAW in WAR (Reach All Women in war) in memory of the outspoken Russian journalist who was killed\n                  in her flat in Moscow on 07 October 2006.\n               \n\nAnna Politkovskaya award\n\nAnna Politkovskaya was a strong critic of Kremlin\u2019s war against Chechen rebels.\n\nAfghanistan's new government and the western authorities pledged swift action to improve the lives of women after the fall\n                  of the Taleban, in 2001.\n               \n\nHowever, the women are currently suffering the same fate as they used to suffer under Taleban, Malalai Joya said.\n\nHer claim is confirmed by other independent organisations. Afghanistan's independent human rights commission says violence\n                  against women has increased over the past year.\n               \n\n\n\n\nA report by the international women's organisation Womankind Worldwide earlier said millions of Afghan women and girls continue\n                  to face discrimination and violence in their day-to-day lives.\n               \n\nBoth Taleban and the Mujahideen warlords are still accused of raping very young girls, some as young as four years, in the\n                  northern Afghanistan, Ms. Joya says.\n               \n\nA son of powerful MP was accused of rape but instead of trying to bring him to justice, she says, the MP has changed his son\u2019s\n                  birth certificate to make him a much younger to avoid his arrest.\n               \n\nMs. Joya was expelled from Loya Girga in December 2003 for questioning the presence of the Mujahideen warlords in the new\n                  \u201cdemocratic\u201d administration supported by the western powers.\n               \n\nAssassination attempts\n\nShe was given UN protection after the incident. She was elected to parliament in 2005, campaigning for women's rights. \n\nMs Joya, 30, was suspended from the parliament said in a television interview that parliament was worse than a stable because,\n                  she said, at least stable animals were useful. \n               \n\nShe has survived four assassination attempts.\n\n\"I am moved from house to house on a daily basis,\"she said after receiving Anna Politkovskaya award in London on 06 October.\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan that has been marred with conflicts for over two decades is currently run by a mafia group, she says.\n\nShe called on the West to withdraw their troops if they don\u2019t change the policy of supporting \u201ccriminal\u201d warlords who she\n                  accuse of corruption and oppressing women with the blessings of western powers.\n               \n\n\u201cMany women are once again forced to wear burqa  even in the capital. Girls in Farah province are willing to go to school\n                  but their school was burnt down by Taleban. Yes few women got job and education opportunities but majority of women still\n                  suffer,\u201d she told BBC Sinhala Service.\n               \n\nPresident Karzai is so powerless in the face of \u201ccriminal\u201d warlords he is jokingly referred to as the \u2018Mayor of Kabul\u2019, according\n                  to Ms. Joya.\n               \n\nThe US-led coalition overthrew the Taleban administration promising to bring peace and democracy to the war-torn South Asian\n                  country.\n               \n\nUS' strategic interests\n\nAnd that is exactly what Afghanistan lacks after seven years of new administration, according to the dissident parliamentarian.\n\nShe says her motherland has been a playground of world\u2019s powerful nations for decades.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWarlords have committed the same crimes as Taleban but nobody is brought to justice. There is no difference between these\n                  people and Pinochet, Musolini, Hitler, so on. In Afghanistan, only the law is the jungle prevails. Killing a woman is like\n                  killing a bird here\u201d.\n               \n\nShe recalls of incidents in which four journalists, who were critical of the government, were beaten by the warlords inside\n                  the parliament. \n               \n\nThe United States, according to Ms. Joya, has no intention of leaving Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe US is happy with the situation in the country. It suits their strategic policies. They use the Taleban insurgency as\n                  an excuse to stay longer in Afghanistan\u201d.\n               \n\nThe winner of the 2008 Anna Politkovskaya award says people have no expectations of the coming elections as they will be conducted\n                  by the same \u201ccriminal\u201d warlords who are supported and financed by the US.\n               \n\nShe called on the activists all over the world to express support for the oppressed women in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\nA selection of your views:\n\nJoya is a wonderful woman and a great daughter of Afghan people, she really deserve any such awards for her courageous fight\n                  against the terrorist and the Western governments. We are proud to have women like Joya in Afghanistan who give us hope.Nooria Atifi, Kabul, Afghanistan\nTL;DR: Women in Afghanistan were thrown into the frying pan from fire by the West since Taleban were overthrown in 2001, a leading\n                     women\u2019s activist said.\n\nArticle: It means the council's decision not to register the northern half of the land as a town green has been overturned. \n\nSome form of public inquiry will now have to be held to decide whether it should be granted town green status or be available for development.\n\nBristol City Football Club wants to build a new stadium on the land.\n\n'Next steps'\n\nA statement from Bristol City Council said legal teams had agreed terms and a consent order had been submitted to the court.\n\n\"Upon the court's approval of the order, the council intends to seek submissions from the parties before finalising the next steps in relation to the northern part of the site,\"it added. \n\n\"No decisions have been made on this process, however we shall make every attempt to move to this next stage as speedily as possible.\"\n\nIn 2009 the city council granted the club permission to build a 30,000 seat stadium on the land at Ashton Vale.\n\nA year later an independent inspector ruled the area should be a town green.\n\nBristol City Council then went against the inspector's recommendation and said only the southern part of the land should be made into a town green, which would have allowed the stadium development to go ahead.\n\nThat decision was challenged by people campaigning for the area to become a town green and the matter was referred to a judicial review, which was scheduled for Thursday. \n\nThe deal means the judicial review will not go ahead. \n\nBristol City Council will decide what form the new public inquiry will take.\nTL;DR: Town green campaigners and Bristol City Council have agreed to end legal proceedings in a three-year dispute over land at Ashton Vale.\n\nArticle: The bug - which was first publicised earlier this month - allows attackers to install code on to phones running Google's mobile operating system and then take control of them.\n\nSymantec said its researchers had found two apps distributed in China that had been infected using the exploit.\n\nGoogle has already taken moves to tackle the problem.\n\nA fortnight ago it released a patch to manufacturers, but it will not have been sent to all handset owners yet.\n\nGoogle also scans its own Play marketplace for the exploit, but this will not protect consumers who download software from other stores.\n\nPremium texts\n\nThe vulnerability was first reported by security research firm BlueBox on 3 July. \n\nAll Android apps contain an encrypted signature that the operating system uses to check the program is legitimate and has not been tampered with.\n\nBut BlueBox said it had found a way to make changes to an app's code without affecting the signature.\n\nIt warned the technique could be used to install a Trojan to read any data on a device, harvest passwords, record phone calls, take photos and carry out other functions.\n\nAccording to Symantec, hackers have now exploited the flaw to install malware called Android.Skullkey, which steals data from compromised phones, monitors texts received and written on the handset, and also sends its own SMS messages to premium numbers.\n\nIt said the Trojan had been added to two legitimate apps used in China to find and make appointments with a doctor.\n\n\"We expect attackers to continue to leverage this vulnerability to infect unsuspecting user devices,\"its report warned.\n\n\"Symantec recommends users only download applications from reputable Android application marketplaces.\"\n\nThe firm added that affected users could manually remove the software by going into their settings menu.\n\nOne telecoms consultant said the news highlighted the difficulty Google had in distributing changes to Android.\n\n\"When Google releases its updates, manufacturers want to check them and then network operators also want to certify the code as well,\"said Ben Wood, director of research at CCS Insight.\n\n\"It's a consequence of having so many different firms making Android devices, with most running their own user interfaces on top.\n\n\"By contrast, Apple just pushes its updates directly to consumers.\"\nTL;DR: A security firm says it has identified the first known malicious use of Android's \"master key\" vulnerability.\n\nArticle: By 2019 there will be an extra 115,000 seats, bringing the total up to 654,000, the rail film said.\n\nBut the percentage increase in seats for London is lower than for large regional cities in England and Wales, which will see a 32% increase.\n\nThe plans are part of Network Rail's business plan for the 2014-19 period.\n\nDave Ward, Network Rail's route managing director for the South East, said: \"The number of passengers using the railway continues to grow year on year. \n\n\"As the railway gets busier, the number of challenges increase and it becomes more complex than ever to run a reliable and cost-effective railway.\"\n\n'Significant benefit'\n\nWatchdog London TravelWatch spokesman Richard Freeston-Clough said:\"The increase in seats on London routes should be seen in the context of the much larger number of seats that are already available.\n\n\"London is starting from a much higher base so even though other areas have a larger percentage increase in seats than London, they will still be some way off the London levels.\"\n\nOther plans announced by Network Rail include: \n\nMr Ward said improvements to London Bridge\"will deliver significant benefit to passengers\".\n\nWatchdog Passenger Focus chief Anthony Smith said: \"Passengers will expect disruption caused by the works to be kept to a minimum, and that information about timetable changes is provided well in advance.  \n\n\"The plans assume fares will continue to increase above the rate of inflation, which will be a concern to passengers who have already faced 10 years of ticket prices rising faster than the cost of

The drivers, who have been described as heroes during the Covid-19 pandemic, will only take industrial action as a last resort. The union, Unite, has been attempting to resolve the issues through negotiation, but this has been unsuccessful. The drivers are unhappy with pay offers, which are real-terms cuts, and propose to roll out remote sign-on, tear up contracts with guaranteed hours, and replace them with zero-hour contracts. Unite officer John Murphy stated that bus workers are coming under attack on pay and conditions from bus operators throughout London. The union is now beginning the process of balloting members for industrial action, which will ramp up in the new year. If members vote in favor, strike action could begin this winter. The drivers are aware that taking industrial action will cause disruption to passengers across London, but they feel that they are being unfairly treated. Transport for London (TfL) has urged Unite and the bus operators to sit down and talk through the issues to try and resolve them as soon as possible. The dispute has been ongoing for some time, and it remains to be seen whether the drivers will take strike action or if a resolution can be reached through negotiation. The drivers' union, Unite, has stated that it will only take industrial action as a last resort, but it is clear that the drivers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the situation. The outcome of the ballot and any potential strike action will be closely watched by the public and the transport industry. \n\nNote: I tried to maintain the same tone and language as the original article, and focused on the main points and key information.

According to the United Nations, diet-related diseases such heart disease, diabetes and cancer pose the greatest global threat to our health; contributing to a staggering 35 million deaths per year, dwarfing the six to eight million smoking-related deaths each year.\n\nIn Britain, one in three children are either overweight or obese by the age of nine, with six out of 10 adults in the same category. \n\nWithout effective intervention this figure could affect 90% of the UK population by 2050 and cost the NHS and the tax payer \u00a345bn a year. \n\nUnless we get a grip of this public health emergency I believe it will cripple the NHS as we know it.\n\nSo what is the biggest culprit? \n\nMore and more evidence is emerging that it is sugars, more specifically High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), which is added to almost all processed food.\n\n'Slow killer'\n\nEarlier this year, paediatric endocrinologist Dr Robert Lustig  \n          \n \n          published a paper in Nature\n stating that sugar consumption has trebled worldwide in the past 50 years and is so damaging to our health that it should be regulated like alcohol. \n        \n\nAccording to obesity researcher and author Zoe Harcombe sugar is the only substance that humans regularly ingest that has no nutritional value whatsoever:\n\n\"[It has] no essential fats, no proteins, no vitamins, no minerals. It is unique in that respect,\"she says. \n\nA little is not a problem, but a lot kills, slowly. And since it is added to nearly all processed food, it is extremely difficult to avoid. \n\nWe should all be concerned about the processed food that we are eating as 40% of those who develop the metabolic syndrome of diabetes, high blood pressure and fatty liver disease will be of normal weight. \n\n'Wrong message'\n\nAs a cardiologist I treat heart disease on a daily basis. At the Royal Free Hospital in London we have one of the fastest treatment times for heart attacks in the UK. \n\nThe NHS has made tremendous improvements in providing this type of care to the majority of the population 24-hours-a-day; that is if you are lucky enough to make it to hospital alive - approximately 40% of heart attack patients do not. \n\nBut, having seen the unspeakable suffering caused by diet-related diseases, I would much rather these patients did not develop them in the first place. \n\nOf course the Olympic sponsors cannot be held accountable for Britain's poor health, but their connection with the Games sends a dreadful message.\n\nIn the context of an obesity epidemic I find it obscene that the Olympics chooses to associate itself with fast food, sugary drinks, chocolate and alcohol.\n\nLabour shadow minister for public health Diane Abbott, whose constituency is in East London close to the Olympic village, is equally scathing:\n\n\"I think it's quite shocking that McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Cadbury's, and Heineken are the main food sponsors,\"she says.\n\n\"These are products which are all very well as a treat, but what Olympic sponsorship allows them to do is promote their brand and insinuate themselves into people's daily diet.\"\n\nImpact on children\n\nI also believe it is wrong for sporting role models to endorse junk food such as sugary drinks, chocolate and crisps. Of particular concern is the negative impact this has on our children. \n\nAnd it is naive and ignorant of sports men and women to blame obesity on lack of physical activity. \n\nI encourage the health benefits of regular exercise, but this is not the solution in tackling obesity. One would have to run for five hours to burn the calories of consuming a chocolate bar, a packet of crisps and a burger and chips washed down with a fizzy drink.\n\nWhen I spoke to former British Olympic swimming gold medallist Duncan Goodhew about the issue he told me that when he was training for the Moscow Olympics in 1980 he avoided all processed foods and was aware even back then that sugary surges were bad for the body and would impair his performance.\n\nIt is time for regulation that has an impact. \n\nA ban on firms such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola from sponsoring major sporting events and the prohibition on the use of celebrities to sell unhealthy food and drink to children would be a good start. \n\nThere is an opportunity for Britain to take the lead by leaving a positive health legacy from the Olympics. \n\nWe do not want the Games to be remembered for being associated with the opening of the largest McDonald's in the world, which has been constructed inside the Olympic park.\n\nWatch Dr Aseem Malhotra's Newsnight's report on the obesity and the Olympics on Monday 9 July 2012 at 22:30 BST on BBC Two, then afterwards on the BBC iPlayer and Newsnight website.\n\nNewsnight put the views expressed Dr Malhotra's report to the International Olympics Committee, the London Organising Committee and a number of key sponsors. Here are the statements they issued in response:\n\nStatement from the International Olympics Committee (IOC):\n\n\"The IOC only enters into partnerships with organisations that it believes work in accordance with the values of the Olympic Movement. Before entering or extending any partnership, we have a duty on behalf of all of the stakeholders in the Olympic Movement to consider this partnership very carefully, particularly where we enter partnerships on a long term basis. We are proud to work with both Coca-Cola and McDonald's, with whom we have long term agreements in place through 2020.\n\n\"Coca-Cola has been a partner of the Olympic Games since 1928, and has an outstanding heritage in supporting the Olympic Movement, and promoting the Olympic Games and active, healthy lifestyles to billions of consumers. Today, Coca-Cola sponsors more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programs in more than 100 countries and is committed to sponsoring a program in every country where it operates by the end of 2015. \n\n\"For London 2012, the company is focused on using its partnership with the Olympic Games to amplify the importance of active, healthy living. In London, Coca-Cola will deliver a variety and choice, and provide easy-to-understand information about their products so consumers can decide what is most appropriate for them. In fact, they will offer the widest range of drinks they have ever offered at an Olympic Games, including sparkling and still, low- and no-calorie choices, juices, smoothies and water.\n\nMcDonald's has supported the Olympic Movement as a sponsor since 1976, and earlier this year we signed an extension to our global partnership with them through to 2020. McDonald's provides a varied menu with a wide choice of high-quality options in its restaurants at the Olympic Games. The company is committed to promoting an active lifestyle, and has implemented well publicised nutrition and active lifestyle programmes around the world. For example, through its Champions of Play programme, McDonald's will bring nearly 200 young people from more than 33 countries to London for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \n\n\"McDonald's also launched the'Happy Meal Mascotathon' in the UK, with unique Happy Meal activity toys to track energy use. McDonald's will offer their most extensive menu at an Olympic Games in their Olympic venue restaurants, and for the first time, will serve Happy Meals which will include fruit, vegetable and dairy options.\n\n\"The companies also support many other sporting organisations and events, ranging from major international events to local grassroots sports programmes - including for example, (Coca-Cola) The Fifa World Cup, the NFL, the Rugby World Cup and (McDonald's) The Fifa World Cup, The Football Association.\n\n\"Funding from the Worldwide TOP Programme goes directly to over 200 National Olympic Committees, as well as to the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games. Without sponsorship funding, the Olympic Games would not happen in its current format and athletes from a number of nations would simply not be able to compete. \n\n\"By showcasing the inspirational sporting achievements of top athletes at the Games, we are able to promote and reinforce the importance of sports as part of a healthy, active lifestyle around the globe. Commercial partnerships play a major role in funding and promoting the Olympic Games, and physical activity initiatives and programmes. \n\n\"By supporting the Olympic Games, our Worldwide Partners promote sport and exercise, not only by supporting the Olympians who are able to train and compete at the Games thanks to the funding they receive, but also among the general public, who can draw inspiration from the performances of these athletes. Our sponsors are dedicated to using their marketing expertise and the appeal of their brands to communicate about physical activity in a relevant way.  \n\n\"We are proud to be working with all of our Worldwide TOP Partners to deliver a successful Olympic Games that will bring with them a wealth of sporting, economic and social benefits.\"\n\nStatement from London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog):\n\n\"Sponsors provide a huge amount of the funding required to stage the Games - without our sponsors, the Games simply wouldn't happen. We have a fantastic group of world class sponsors on board, working with us to stage spectacular Games this summer. \n\n\"They also have some great activation programmes which are helping deliver the vision behind London 2012, to use the Games to achieve lasting change. \n\n\"There will be sponsor-branded restaurants and products in the Olympic Park. This will be alongside a diverse and full-range of other local food offerings which we are committed to providing. We will cater for the wide range of people attending the Games, from athletes to spectators.\"\n\nStatement from Coca-Cola:\n\n\"As one of the longest, continuous sponsors of the Olympic Movement, we are proud that we are able to use our sponsorship to enable millions of people to experience the Games and believe we have a valid role to play. As well as sharing expertise, without the support of sponsors such as Coca-Cola, many National Olympic Committees would be unable to send athletes to compete.\n\n\"People consume many different foods and beverages, so no one single food or beverage alone is responsible for people being overweight or obese. We believe all of our drinks can be enjoyed as part of an active, healthy lifestyle that includes a sensible, balanced diet and regular physical activity.\n\n\"We have continually innovated our beverage choices - from one product in one size offered at the 1948 Olympic Games to today more than 500 brands with over 800 low- and no-calorie beverages.  At London 2012 we will provide the widest range of drinks and sizes ever offered at an Olympic or Paralympic Games, to suit every lifestyle and hydration need.\n\n\"We are also helping people be physically active and our three-year partnership with StreetGames will connect 110,000 young people with sport and create a new generation of coaches. Coca-Cola sponsors more than 250 physical activity and nutrition education programmes in more than 100 countries and we are committed to sponsoring a programme in every country that we operate in by the end of 2015.\"\n\nStatement from McDonald's:\n\n\"Sponsorship is essential to the successful staging of the Olympics and Paralympics. The Games is the biggest catering operation in the world and there aren't many businesses that can rise to this challenge and do so in any country that the Olympics choose to visit. As a London 2012 sponsor, we are using our catering and customer service expertise to provide high quality British food quickly and safely, as well as our experience in people development to help train the 70,000 volunteers needed for the Games in our role as the Presenting Partner for the Games Maker programme. \n\n\"We recognise that public health issues like obesity are complex matters that cannot be solved by governments or companies alone. Ultimately it's up to individuals to make the right food, drink, and activity choices for themselves and our broad range of menu options in a variety of sizes, together with the nutrition information, means that customers can make more informed choices. \n\n\"At London 2012 we will be serving our broadest ever menu at any Olympics - alongside our traditional options such as burgers and fries, we have many other options such as porridge, wraps, salads and fruit bags. We have also invested in a programme of recipe reformulation to deliver real benefits to our customers, for example reducing the salt in the Chicken McNuggets by 30% and reducing salt in our fries by a quarter. Our average children's meal sold in 2011 contained 31% less sugar compared to 2011 and 46% less salt than it did in 2000.\n\n\"We're committed to using our involvement in London 2012 to contribute to leaving a lasting legacy after the Games, whether that's by innovating to make our Olympic Park restaurants the most sustainable in the world, helping to train the 70,000 volunteers, or creating a nationally-recognised qualification for the volunteers that we'll hand over to the hospitality sector after the Games to help drive up customer service standards across our sector.\"\n\nStatement from Cadbury:\n\n\"The sale of confectionery and ice cream is long established at Olympic and Paralympic Games' venues along with many other snacks and treats. It is therefore entirely appropriate for those treats to be made by Cadbury as the Games come to Britain and we are very proud to give our support to London 2012.\"\n\nStatement from Heineken:\n\n\"Heineken is proud to be a supplier and partner to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\n\"As an industry leader and a global business, Heineken is unequivocally committed to the responsible marketing of its beers and ciders. We have a long track record of harnessing the power of global sporting events such as the Uefa Champions League and the Rugby World Cup to increase consumer awareness of both the Heineken brand and the responsible consumption of alcohol. \n\n\"Heineken actively encourages the enjoyment of beer in moderation as part of a healthy balanced lifestyle at all times.\"\nTL;DR: On a recent visit to Newham, home of London's Olympic village, I was shocked to learn that in the past 10 years the incidence of diabetes there has more than doubled.\n\nArticle: By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter\n\nCloudflare, a San Francisco-based firm that provides added security for websites to prevent cyber-attacks, said it would stop protecting 8chan at midnight Pacific Time (08:00 BST) on Monday. \n\nThe 21-year-old suspect in this weekend\u2019s shooting in El Paso, Texas, is understood to have used 8chan to spread his manifesto. \n\nPreviously, the site was also used by the suspect in March\u2019s shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, as well as the suspect in April's synagogue shooting in Poway, California. \n\nLosing Cloudflare\u2019s protection has made 8chan vulnerable to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, whereby a website is bombarded with traffic that overwhelms its servers, rendering it inaccessible. \n\nA few minutes after the Cloudflare service was withdrawn, 8chan did indeed become unavailable. \n\nHowever, 8chan's site administrator says it was moving to another security firm, BitMitigate, based in the US state of Washington. BitMitigate's website says it has\"a proven commitment to liberty\". \n\nBitMitigate stepped in to help neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer when it lost Cloudflare protection in 2017.\n\nThe BBC has approached BitMitigate for comment. But at this time 8Chan remains offline.\n\nCloudflare chief executive Matthew Prince had said, in the wake of Saturday\u2019s shootings, that his firm would continue to support 8chan as its policy was to remain neutral over the type of content the service protected. \n\nHowever, on Sunday evening Mr Prince wrote in a blog post that\"8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate\u201d. \n\n\u201cThey have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,\u201d Mr Prince wrote.  \n\n\"Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.\u201d \n\nMr Prince warned that while 8chan would be disrupted by Cloudflare\u2019s decision, it would likely be able to rebuild itself - as was the case when Cloudflare stopped providing protection for the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, in 2017. \n\n\u201cThey quickly came back online using a Cloudflare competitor,\u201d Mr Prince wrote. \n\n\"That competitor at the time promoted as a feature the fact that they didn't respond to legal process.\n\nHe added:\"I have little doubt we'll see the same happen with 8chan. While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online. It does nothing to address why mass shootings occur. It does nothing to address why portions of the population feel so disenchanted they turn to hate. \n\n\"In taking this action we've solved our own problem, but we haven't solved the internet\u2019s.\u201d \n\nHow do Cloudflare and BitMitigate services work?\n\nThe two companies protect websites from attacks, as well as making websites load more quickly for legitimate users.\n\nThey can be thought of as a kind of bouncer or security guard for websites that get a large amount of traffic, or may be a likely target of cyber-attacks.\n\nThey use technology that can verify where internet traffic is coming from and what it is trying to do. \n\nThey can distinguish whether the visitor is a genuine person, a network of automated bots that is being used to flood a website or requests that keep servers too busy to handle normal uses. \n\nThey are meant to block any attempts from\"bad\"traffic getting through.\n\nCloudflare provides protection for more than 12 million websites, and is expected to float on the stock market later this year.\n\nChief executive Matthew Prince has expressed concern at the power his company has to decide whether or not a website is able to exist on the open internet. \n\n8chan is a forum created in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an alternative to 4chan, a message board popular with gamers. 8chan promised less moderation of controversial topics and images that were being removed from 4chan. As such, 8chan has hosted far-right extremist views and imagery. \n\nMr Brennan gave up ownership of 8chan in 2015 and has since called for it to be shut down. Following Cloudflare\u2019s announcement, he wrote on Twitter:\"Thank you so much @CloudFlare Finally this nightmare might have an end.\u201d \n\n8chan is now owned and run by Jim Watkins, a former US army veteran, believed to be living in the Philippines. \n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?

unfortunately times changed for the worse and we had police officers being killed, threatened and injured,\"he said.\n\nPat Sheehan of Sinn F\u00e9in said:\"We certainly had some disagreements with Matt over the past few years, but he came to the job with a background in community policing which is something we would have majored on heavily.\"\n\nThe current deputy chief constable Judith Gillespie is also due to leave her post in March.\nTL;DR: Northern Ireland's Chief Constable Matt Baggott has announced his decision to retire from the post.\n\nArticle: On Friday, an overwhelming majority of a parliamentary committee rejected as\"undeserving\"ABS-CBN's request for a 25-year extension of its franchise.\n\nGovernment critics say the refusal is directly connected to the channel's criticism of President Rodrigo Duterte. \n\nABS-CBN refused to broadcast Mr Duterte's campaign ads in 2016.\n\nThe broadcaster, which operates dozens of radio and TV stations, was first taken off air on 4 May its broadcast licence expired.\n\nAhead of the vote on its renewal application, pictures on social media showed supporters of the network outside Congress holding up posters proclaiming\"Defend Press Freedom\"and\"Stop The Attacks\".\n\n\"This is a black day for media freedom in a country previously regarded as a bastion of press freedom and democracy in the region,\"Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said on Friday.\n\n\"Today's vote to deny the franchise renewal is an astounding display of obsequious behaviour by Congressional representatives, kowtowing to Duterte by agreeing to seriously limit media freedom in the Philippines,\"he said.\n\nOpposition lawmakers say the suspension also undermines the fight against the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 50,000 people in the country and killed more than 1,300.\n\nABS-CBN regularly reached more than 15 million homes on TV, radio and online. Founded in 1953, the media conglomerate employs some 11,000 people.\n\nIt can appeal against Friday's decision.\n\nWhile freedom of the press is guaranteed under the constitution, the Philippines is one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, according to the US-based charity Freedom House.\n\nAnd according to press freedom group Reporters Without Borders,\"Private militias, often hired by local politicians, silence journalists with complete impunity\".\n\nLast month, Maria Ressa, the head of popular online news site Rappler, was found guilty of libel, in a case seen by many as an attempt to silence the site, which had been critical of the government.\n\nThe Philippines ranks 136th out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index.\n\nAlthough a commercial operation, ABS-CBN is very similar to the British Broadcasting Corporation. With more than 70 years of TV and radio history, it has shaped the Filipino psyche with entertainment and news programmes for all of the family.\n\nBut its critics say it represents the rich and powerful of the Philippines and, as an old, mainstream media offering, is out of touch with the will of social media users here.\n\nSupporters of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte say it is biased against him, but human rights groups say his supporters are missing the point - they say journalists are needed more than ever to keep Mr Duterte's power in check.\n\nThey point to the case of the news website Rappler. In 2018 alone, 11 legal cases were filed against the company in a move opposition groups say was a revenge attack by the president for critical coverage of his bloody drug war.\n\nWith television screens now blank where ABS-CBN's news programmes would otherwise be running, journalists are already calling 10 July 2020 a\"black day\"for freedom of speech in the Philippines.\nTL;DR: One of the Philippines' largest broadcasters, ABS-CBN, has been refused a new licence after being forced off air in May.\n\nArticle: By Michael BuchananSocial affairs correspondent, BBC News\n\nMelbury Court in Durham is thought to be the care home with the highest number of deaths in the UK.\n\nCounty Durham has had the highest number of care home deaths in England and Wales.\n\nDurham County Council said it\"strongly refuted\"the claim by the County Durham Care Home Association (CDCHA).\n\nSome patients went from the nearby University Hospital of North Durham to Melbury Court without being tested for coronavirus or after a positive test.\n\nOwners HC-One said the 87-bed home was now in\"recovery\"with many residents returning to health.\n\nIt is not known how many people there have been ill.\n\n'Neglect'\n\nA BBC investigation has discovered that in a conference call in late March, council officials were told plans to move hospital patients into care homes without testing would be disastrous.  \n\nThe CDCHA offered to find a specific home or homes where Covid-19 positive or untested people could be cared for rather than have them spread around the network.  \n\nThis was never acted on and now the CDCHA has calculated there has been an outbreak of coronavirus in 81 of the county's 149 care homes.  \n\nMaria Vincent, who runs Crosshill Care Home in Stanhope, told the council in March that care homes were not set up to accept Covid-19 patients, and described it as\"neglect pure and simple\".\n\nShe said:\"They knew at the beginning how vulnerable older people were because in Spain they'd had numerous people who'd died in care homes.  \n\n\"With just a little bit of forethought, true collaborative working, we could easily have got through this without the number of deaths we've had.\"\n\nThe latest figures from the Office of National Statistics shows there have been 275 deaths in care homes in County Durham - more than in hospitals.  \n\nLocal care providers said deaths in care homes in the county are twice as high as the average for the whole of England. \n\nThe council say high levels of ill health and deprivation are contributory factors.\n\nIn a letter sent to Durham County Council and seen by the BBC, the CDCHA said:\"The council has pursued a policy which has caused and/or increased Covid-19 infections and deaths within care homes in County Durham\".\n\nSamuel Wilson died at Melbury Court in early May, aged 92, after testing positive for Covid-19 following his return from a routine procedure at the University Hospital of North Durham.  \n\nSome of the family had objected to him going to hospital, arguing it was too risky amid the pandemic and urged staff to manage his condition in the home, but they were persuaded.\n\nHis granddaughter Tracey O'Kennedy said:\"The home was relentless for a family member to take him into hospital for a non-essential procedure in the middle of full lockdown.  \n\n\"In my opinion, they took an unnecessary risk, a risk that cost granddad his life.\"\n\nIn County Durham the council initially tied additional funding for coronavirus-related costs to homes being willing to accept people who had tested positive for the virus or were untested, although this was later changed. \n\nDurham County Council said it\"strongly refuted\"the accusation from the CDHCA that it had contributed to care home deaths. \n\nIt said it had considered the idea of a separate care home for Covid-19 patients but felt it was not appropriate due to the predicted number of cases.  \n\nJane Robinson, corporate director for adults and health, said:\"We followed national guidelines and we've done absolutely everything that we can do.\n\n\"We've put in additional financial support, provided PPE, and we've provided training and support and psychological support for our care home staff as well.\"\nTL;DR: At least 25 people have died at a care home amid claims from an industry body that a council's actions \"caused\" or \"increased Covid-19 deaths\".\n\nArticle: The separate works depict a mountain scene, a river and a distant figure sat beneath a tree.\n\nThe watercolours were created in the early 20th Century while Hitler, later guilty of some of the worst crimes in history, worked as a painter in Munich.\n\nAuctioneers said that while they had\"no artistic value\", the pictures could sell for thousands of euros.\n\nStrong demand is expected from online bidders in the UK, Scandinavia, the US and Russia.\n\nThe paintings' elderly sellers reportedly did not want to be identified.\n\n\"If you walk down the Seine and see 100 artists, 80 will be better than this,\"Heinz-Joachim Maeder, a spokesperson for the Kloss auction house in Berlin, told Reuters. \n\n\"The value of these objects and the media interest is because of the name at the bottom,\"he added. \n\nBefore World War One, in which he fought, Hitler worked in Vienna as a casual labourer and an artist, drawing postcards and paintings.\n\nHe was twice rejected from the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nIn his book Mein Kampf, he claimed to have produced as many as three paintings a day.\n\nWhile in power, Hitler allegedly ordered the collection and destruction of his artworks, but several hundred are known to still exist.\n\nIn Germany, it is legal to sell pictures by Hitler so long as they do not contain Nazi symbols.\n\nMany are held by the US Army, which confiscated them at the end of World War Two.

Unfortunately, due to parliamentary business I can not attend your committee on 24 February.\n\n\"I look forward to appearing before your committee once the framework is agreed.\"\n\nIn response, committee convenor Kenneth Gibson told Mr Hands:\"This would appear to suggest that you do not think an agreement will be reached on the fiscal framework before then.\"\n\nHe urged Mr Hands to reconsider, stating:\"If this is indeed the case, then it is essential that the Finance Committee has the opportunity to hear from both governments as to why it has not been possible to reach an agreement.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has already warned it will pull the plug on the Scotland Bill by recommending MSPs veto the legislation if an agreement over the fiscal framework cannot be found.\nTL;DR: A deal on the financial arrangements that will underpin Scotland's new devolution powers \"seems within reach\", a UK government minister has said.\n\nArticle: But Stephen Miller told Swansea Crown Court the account he gave was untrue, and he had not been there.\n\nMr Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris were released after their convictions were quashed in 1992.\n\nEight ex-police officers deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Two other people deny perjury.\n\nMr Miller, who was wrongly convicted in 1990 of Ms White's murder, said he\"needed to follow the story\"which police had provided him.\n\nHe told the court he had even added some fiction of his own to make his version of events sound more plausible.\n\nNick Dean QC, prosecuting, said Mr Miller had been told he would be questioned until he\"got it right\"and supported the lies detectives had already bullied several\"witnesses\"into telling.\n\nDuring his opening address, he had said of the way Mr Miller had been questioned:\"Short of physical violence it is hard to imagine a more hostile and intimidating approach.\"\n\n'Brainwashing'\n\nMr Miller, who had been Miss White's boyfriend, was formally interviewed 19 times for a total of 13 hours and the jury has been listening to the tapes.\n\nInitially, Mr Miller said he had known nothing about the murder of Ms White, a prostitute.\n\nHe said he had not seen her for several days prior to her death and had not known she had been using the flat to entertain clients.\n\nSeveral interviews later, he told officers he had been inside the flat, had seen her being attacked and could name those responsible.\n\nAsked by Mr Dean why he had given that account, Mr Miller said he had to\"follow the storyline\".\n\nMr Dean had told the jury earlier that as the interviews progressed, the police did such a good job of brainwashing Mr Miller that for several weeks after he had been charged he actually believed he had been there.\n\nBut Mr Dean added that none of the accused men had been there and the real killer had been Jeffrey Gafoor, who was alone at the time.\n\nEight former police officers involved in the 1988 investigation are on trial charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. They have all denied the charge.\n\nMs White was stabbed more than 50 times inside Flat 1, in James Street, Cardiff, which she had been using as a prostitute.  \n\nGafoor confessed to killing Ms White and was jailed in 2003.\n\nThe trial continues.\nTL;DR: A man wrongly convicted of the 1988 Cardiff murder of Lynette White gave detectives a graphic account of her death, a court has heard.\n\nArticle: Colombo district parliamentarian and the leader of the Western Peoples Front (WPF) told BBC Sandeshaya :\"That is the main reason for the lack of peace in Sri Lanka\".\n\nCampaigners launched a satyagraha in Colombo's Hyde Park on Friday to mark the interantionl day of peace.\n\nSatyagraha in Colombo\n\nThe satyagraha attended by representatives from all major religions and peace activists was organised by the Anti - War National Front (AWNF).\n\n\n\nAWNF leader, Kumar Rupasinghe, called on the public to raise their voice against the ongoing war between the government forces and the Tamil Tigers.\n\n\"The government, other militant groups and the LTTE are engaged in violence because the public does not raise their voice against,\"he told BBC's Elmo Fernando.\n\nWomen's art exhibition\n\nThe protest was called\"For a humane country defeating the killing culture\".\n\nLeader of the Left Front Dr. Vickramabahu Karunarathne accused the authorities of exploiting the war to'opress' trade unions and mass organisations.\n\n\n\nSiritunga Jayasuriya, leader of the Civil Monitoring Committee, who echoed the same views added that the government is exagerating victories in the war front to continue the war against the LTTE.\n\nWomen for Peace (WFP), meanwhile, marked the international day by organisng an art exhibition at Lipton roundabout in the capital.\n\nViola Perera, WFP's senior programme officer told BBC Sandeahaya:\"Women should come forward for peace as they are a major group in the community that suffer from the conflict\".\nTL;DR: Lack of equality among communities and religious groups is the main cause for the conflict in the island nation, peace campaigners said.\n\nArticle: John Swinney said there would have to be a\"phased\"return to allow for social distancing.\n\nThat could mean classes being split, with\"some pupils using classrooms in the morning and others in the afternoon\".\n\nSchools have been closed across Scotland since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced last month.\n\nThe Scottish government says there are early signs that the impact of the virus is being contained.\n\nIt has published a document outlining the basis of an exit strategy from the UK-wide lockdown.\n\nPart of that process could involve:\n\nMr Swinney said:\"The idea that schools will be reconvening and all pupils will be back at the same time on the same day is not a circumstance I can envisage any time soon.\n\n\"There is clearly disruption to the learning of young people right now and we need to find the most effective way to bring school communities back together again and to make sure that formal learning can be revived.\n\n\"What we have to look at is how we might bring schools back on a phased basis with different groups of pupils coming back at different times, or changes to the school day to accommodate different groupings of individual pupils.\"\n\nLast week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accepted it would be difficult to implement social distancing in schools - especially where younger children were involved.\n\nMr Swinney said there was still no public health case for schools reopening - but when they do, it will be under very different circumstances.\n\nHe said:\"If people were wondering, would we be in a position any time soon to bring back entire school communities on the basis that they were working before Covid, I think that's inconceivable.\n\n\"In some circumstances you would have secondary schools with 1,600 of 1,700 people coming back on the same day into buildings which are always congested with children, young people and teachers. \n\n\"What we must undertake is a proper analysis of how can operate formal education while respecting social distancing and the other issues that are important in the public health advice.\"\n\nHealth and wellbeing\n\nScotland's largest teachers' union, the EIS, also backs a\"blended\"approach to education when schools eventually reopen.\n\nThe union's general secretary Larry Flanagan said:\"We have been clear that until the Scottish government has the capacity to test, track and isolate the virus, it would be impossible for teachers to return to work and be confident that they are in a safe environment.\n\n\"Beyond that, there is a lot of discussion about how schools will be able to operate with social distancing in place.\n\n\"I think we are looking at some kind of blended approach whereby there is some continuation of working outside of the school and getting some back in.\n\nHe added:\"Our instinct is that we need to offer all pupils some access to school education because the interaction with their fellow pupils and teachers is integral to their health and wellbeing.\n\n\"We need to have universal provision but that clearly won't be under the normal arrangement that people are used to.\"\nTL;DR: Scotland's education secretary has said it is \"inconceivable\" that all pupils will return to school at the same time.\n\nArticle: Staff killed Harambe in May after he grabbed a three-year-old boy who got into his enclosure.\n\nSince then he has become a favourite subject of jokers, satirists and campaigners.\n\nResponding, Cincinnati Zoo said the constant mentions were making it difficult for staff to move on.\n\n\"Our zoo family is still healing,\"director Thane Maynard told Associated Press in an email.\"We are honouring Harambe by redoubling our gorilla conservation efforts and encouraging others to join us.''\n\nMr Maynard's twitter account was hacked over the weekend. The zoo's accounts have also been flooded with replies.\n\nHarambe's death sparked huge controversy. \n\nDebates touched on everything from whether zoo staff were correct to shoot him to why there was so much focus on him amid open conflicts elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe boy's mother has faced abuse online from those who blamed her for the death of the 17-year-old gorilla. Prosecutors ruled against pressing charges.\n\nCincinnati Zoo reopened its Gorilla World exhibit in June with a higher barrier in an attempt to prevent any more accidents.\n\nAfter his death, numerous petitions have been created in Harambe's honour, some calling for him to be turned into a Pokemon Go character, to be put on a dollar, or carved into Mount Rushmore.\n\nA poll in Texas suggested he would get 2% of the popular vote in the US presidential race.\n\nThen there are the stream of jokes and references online.\n\nBut Harambe has been appropriated in nasty ways, such as in the racist abuse of actress Leslie Jones. \n\nRetired Australian football player Adam Goodes also faced similar attacks online.\nTL;DR: A zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio, says it is \"not amused\" by the numerous memes and petitions created after one of its gorillas was shot dead.\n\nArticle: It is the first time Mr Mueller has spoken about what happened backstage at a Detroit concert in 2013.\n\nTaylor is suing him for assault and battery over the incident, which she says left her\"shocked and withdrawn\".\n\nHe denies the claim that he grabbed her\"bare bottom\"under her skirt.\n\nThe ex-DJ was fired from his job at a Colorado country music station after the encounter and has now spoken about the legal case with Detroit radio show, Mojo In The Morning.\n\nUS website TMZ has shared a photo from the meet and greet, which David says does not show him groping Taylor.\n\n\"I'm trying to get my right hand behind Taylor because [his girlfriend] Shannon was on the other side of Taylor,\"David explains, discussing the photo. \n\n\"My other hand was just on my belt or on my pocket.\"\n\n\"So my right hand, I've got my hand closed and my palm down and I reach behind toward Taylor.

I was barely able to get the words out.\n\n\"It was like somebody switched the lights off in my personality.\"\n\nShe says there were four members of her team in the photo booth during the meet and greet session and she continued to meet every fan waiting before reporting the incident.\n\nTaylor's security guard, Greg Dent, claims he witnessed the assault, shortly before the photo was taken.\n\n\"Well, before the photo was taken is when I saw him go to put his arm around her and him lift up her skirt,\"he said during his deposition. \n\n\"She reacted, pushed her skirt down, and jumped to the side and went closer to the girl that was with him.\"\n\n\"My hand was never under her skirt, I never grabbed her,\"David tells Mojo In The Morning.\n\n\"My hand was not open.

I contacted a criminal attorney, I thought for sure I was going to get arrested, I thought for sure I was going to get charges.\"\n\nAfter the alleged assault, David lost his job at 98.5 KYGO when the station was presented with evidence against him two days later.\n\nAn original statement from Taylor Swift's spokeswoman says his sacking was an\"independent decision\"made by his employers after they were presented with evidence against him the day after the incident.\n\nDavid initially sued Taylor for slander, leading her to counter sue.\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat\nTL;DR: Former radio DJ David Mueller has denied claims by Taylor Swift that he assaulted her during a meet and greet with fans.\n\nArticle: About 60 firefighters tackled the fire at the Cycle King shop on Angel Hill, Bury St Edmunds, on 29 September.\n\nAshley Finley, 24, of Borley Cresent, Elmswell, and Dysney Sibbons, 23, of Elmsett Close, Stowmarket, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday.\n\nThey both denied arson.\n\nThey were given unconditional bail and will stand trial on 4 March next year.\n\nTwo neighbouring buildings, including the One Bull pub, were also damaged.\nTL;DR: Two men have denied starting a blaze in the centre of a historic town last year, which caused \u00a31.6m worth of damage.\n\nArticle: By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter \n\nMany US warehouse workers are entitled to only 10 days' leave a year - for all holidays, sickness and emergencies.\n\nAnd some had asked Amazon to change its policy to stop coronavirus spreading.\n\nSome workers also say they are being told increase their hours, known as mandatory extra time, because of increased demand and staff shortages.\n\n'Financial distress'\n\nIn a blog, Amazon said:\"The health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority as we face the challenges associated with Covid-19. \n\n\"Effective immediately, all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two weeks of pay. \n\n\"This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay. \n\n\"This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March.\"\n\nAmazon has also established a $25m (\u00a319.6m) fund to support independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants and seasonal employees\"under financial distress\".\n\nBBC News has had access to an online forum used by about 25,000 Amazon warehouse workers.\n\nAnd some of those unaffected by coronavirus are clearly relieved they will no longer have to struggle into work when either they or their family are sick.\n\n\"My two kids have been sick and last night I felt like death.

Cardiff-based Peacocks operates 423 stores with 4,369 staff.\n\nSome Peacocks stores had already begun to shut following an announcement on 15 October. \n\nPhilip Day has quietly built a retail empire over the last 18 years and his huge footprint on high streets across the UK served him well. He did so by snapping up a string of businesses out of administration. \n\nCritics say he didn't do much with them. He didn't do much business online, either. That left him and his chains more exposed when shoppers stampeded to the internet during lockdown. \n\nMr Day still has Bonmarche, a business which he bought through a separate investment vehicle and isn't affected by the current insolvency process. It went into administration last year amid challenging trading conditions. He went on to buy it back, with fewer stores. \n\nWill he now do the same with Peacocks or walk away? According to the most recent company accounts, the EWM Group made a pre-tax profit of \u00a331m in the six months until March 2019. It also had plenty of cash in the bank and next to no debt.

He's not prepared to do that. This dependency on mega-projects almost invariably creates massive opportunities for embezzlement,\"Mr Galeotti said.\n\nWhy is Vostochny so important for Russia?\n\nVostochny was Russia's first purpose-built civilian site for commercial space launches. The first launch took place in April 2016 and there have been four more since.\n\nThe vast new site is in Russia's far east, well away from big cities, which reduces the risk of rocket debris hitting any large urban centre. The site used to be a Soviet missile base called Svobodny.\n\nSpace missions are a matter of national pride for Russia: it was the Soviet Union, after all, which sent the first human into space - Yuri Gagarin - in 1961.\n\nVisiting Vostochny in September, Mr Putin told space officials:\"This is the country's most important construction project of national significance.\"\n\nVostochny's total cost is currently put at 300bn roubles (\u00a33.6bn; $4.7bn), Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reports. But the project has been dogged by cost overruns and delays.\n\nDeveloping Vostochny is also a highly political move, as Russia has until now relied on the Soviet-era Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for international space launches. Kazakhstan is a close neighbour, but having the main launch facility on Russian territory is safer for Moscow in the long term.\n\nThe space centre is still being built: a second launchpad under construction will host the Angara, a new heavy-payload rocket, with the inaugural launch set for 2021.\n\nVostochny also lies in an under-developed region with high levels of poverty, so the centre could help the local economy.\n\nHow did things turn sour at Vostochny?\n\nIn early 2015 a group of building workers at the site went on hunger strike, saying they were owed wages after a subcontractor's bankruptcy. \n\nWhen the planned first rocket launch was delayed in 2015 - it took place the following year - Mr Putin ordered the SK to examine how Vostochny was being managed. Far-reaching corruption was discovered.\n\nOn Sunday the SK reported that 58 officials involved in the project had been sentenced for fraud and abuse of office. \n\nKhrizman's theft alone cost the state 5.2bn roubles in losses. He and several other construction managers were jailed in February 2018.\n\nHis son Mikhail was jailed for five-and-a-half years. \n\nThe former chief accountant of Dalspetsstroy, Vladimir Ashikhmin, got seven years. The former president of the Khabarovsk regional assembly, Viktor Chudov, got six years.\n\nBudget funds were embezzled by artificially inflating labour and material costs and through fake deals with subcontractors, Russian business daily Kommersant reported. \n\nSub-standard concrete was also used for the launchpad, which then had to be repaired, Tass news agency said.\n\nRead more on Russia's space programme:\n\nDespite the scandal, Vostochny is still being overseen by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the state space agency Roscosmos.\n\nMr Rogozin is close to Mr Putin, but not in the president's inner circle of top aides, Prof Galeotti told the BBC.\n\n'Stealing hundreds of millions'\n\nAt a government meeting on 11 November Mr Putin spoke angrily about the continuing corruption at Vostochny. \n\n\"A hundred times people were told:'Work transparently.' But no! They're stealing hundreds of millions,\"Mr Putin said.\n\nHis spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that the outburst was directed at the previous - not current - managers of the project. He said 11bn roubles had been stolen, of which 3.5bn had been later recovered.\n\nLack of financial transparency is the basic problem with this and other big state projects in Russia, Prof Galeotti said. \n\n\"President Putin would love Vostochny to be demonstrably a world-beater, he's looking for success stories now, but even this isn't enough to tackle the problems in the system. He's unwilling to really modernise the fundamentals of the system.\"\n\nHe said the problems were reminiscent of Soviet-era white elephant projects, notorious for wasted resources.\n\nOther countries, including the US and China, remain keen to do business with Roscosmos, valuing its space expertise and technical prowess.\n\nBut new players in space, like Elon Musk's SpaceX, are already challenging Russia's competitive advantage.\nTL;DR: Russia's new Vostochny space centre has lost at least 11bn roubles (\u00a3133m; $172m) through theft and top officials have been jailed.\n\nArticle: By John ArklessBBC Wales News\n\nFigures from the Gwent, South Wales, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales forces showed there were 184,880 speeding offences, a rate of 506 per day. \n\nIt represents a rise of 8.1% from the previous year when 171,000 offences were captured in 2016. \n\nSpeeding charity Brake said the figures were\"deeply concerning\". \n\nGwent Police saw the greatest rise in offences - up 62% from 29,611 in 2016 to 47,992 last year.\n\nAlmost half of these came on the M4, between junction 24 (Coldra) and junction 28 (Tredegar Park), which recorded a total of 27,041 speeding vehicles over the course of the year. \n\nA variable speed camera was installed in September 2016 and caught 13,000 drivers in its first six months of use. \n\nIn 2016, the busiest camera in Wales was the southbound camera on North Road in Cardiff, catching 8,418 drivers. This number fell to 6,496 in 2017. \n\nSouth Wales saw the highest number of offences with 71,700, up from 66,086 in 2016 - an increase of 8.5%. \n\nThe number of offenders caught by North Wales Police fell from 62,501 to 51,768 in 2017 - down 17.2%. \n\nThe busiest fixed speed camera in this area was on the A483 dual carriageway at Rossett in Wrexham, which recorded just under 4,000 offences.\n\nIn the Dyfed-Powys area, the number increased marginally from 13,374 to 13,420, with the busiest camera, on the A449 at Cefn Barn, Powys, recording 900 speeding drivers. \n\nThe minimum fine for being caught speeding in the UK \u00a3100 and three penalty points. \n\nIf all fines were upheld in Wales, at least \u00a318,488,000 will have been raised by speeding alone.\n\nA spokesman for speeding charity Brake said:\"The increase in speeding offences in Wales indicates a deeply concerning trend of unsafe driving behaviour.\n\n\"Increased police enforcement is welcome, however, we need more robust penalties in order to deter drivers from breaking the law and putting lives at risk on our roads.\"\n\nSgt Trystan Bevan from North Wales Police' roads policing unit said:\"We are committed to making our roads a safer place for all who use them and we will continue to crack down on those irresponsible drivers who choose to ignore speed limits and drive irresponsibly, not only risking their own lives but the lives of others.\"\nTL;DR: More than 500 drivers were caught speeding in Wales each day in 2017, according to Freedom of Information data.\n\nArticle: By Sophia Smith GalerBBC News\n\nIt involves users digitally darkening their skin colour and looking sad - before revealing their natural, lighter skin tone at the end and smiling.\n\nColourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are of the same race but lighter-skinned.\n\nA huge backlash has prompted deletions and calls for TikTok to take the videos down. \n\nThe trend, which began earlier this week, has reignited a huge debate on colourism in India and beyond.\n\nIt sees users lip-sync to a song from a Tamil film called 3, with lyrics about a\"white skin girl\"with a\"black heart\", and gesture to their artificial skin tone.\n\nThe music has been used more than 21,000 times, with the videos receiving millions of views. \n\n'Black heart'\n\nRadhika Parameswaran, a professor at Indiana University and commentator on colourism, says this trend is disconnected from the original context.\n\nIn the film, a beautiful light-skinned woman who has a\"black heart\"is impervious to the hero's love. The song\"did not explicitly refer to dark skin, but nevertheless Kolaveri Di's catchy tunes and lyrics become creative fodder for these youths to stage their playful and dramatic performances of skin colour mutating from dark to light,\"she said.\n\nOne user commented:\"This shouldn't be a trend. Every skin tone is beautiful no matter where you live or where you're from. We are all equal in this world.\"\n\nKavipriya Vimalraj, who has 350,000 followers, reacted to the video in a\"duet\"which has been viewed more than 215,000 times. She told the BBC: \"Making this kind of video indirectly saying that lighter tone people are happier and likeable in society is not acceptable or true.\"\n\nBut another user argued that\"if you know Tamil this is a love song\".\n\nUser @nikhilsoni123, who created a video based on the trend, said:\"Guys this video is not to hurt anyone. I truly agree colour shouldn't matter! Colourism shouldn't be celebrated! It was in trend so we did it.\"\n\nTikTok backlash\n\nSince the first video in this trend went up earlier in April, some of the films have been deleted. But many more remain on the platform. \n\nNow duet or reaction videos labelling the videos racist or colourist are flooding the site, with some overtaking the views of the original videos. \n\nUser @.ashakira commented on one reaction video that\"most of them have turned off their comments because they are well aware of the backlash they're getting\".\n\nSome say they have reported the video but that TikTok responded by saying the videos did not violate their guidelines. \n\nKavitha Emmanuel, founder and director of the Dark Is Beautiful campaign, is confused by the message of these videos but hopes it will turn into a positive conversation about colourism in India. The trend\"intentionally or unintentionally... is surfacing the underlying toxic belief that measures a person's worth based on their skin colour.\"\n\n\"Remarks are often seen as funny and we don't realise how it hurts people.\"\n\nTikTok's community guidelines say users should not post\"content that dehumanises or incites violence or hatred against individuals or groups\". \n\nTikTok users around the world have been reacting to the trend. \n\nJavier Felipe is Colombian and lives in Kenya. He's a verified TikTok creator known as @afrobeatswithkamau and made a reaction video calling the trend racist.\n\n\"My first thought was I was very shocked to see how this can be taking off as a trend,\"he told the BBC.\n\n\"No matter where we are, how niche we think our audience is, we have to know that our content is global. A simple video that we make has global implications. People are failing to see that you're putting down your own people where there's a history of colourism in India but then imagine, you're in a global community. I live in Kenya and all my peers are shocked. \n\n\"I think one of the first steps is having TikTok take down these videos but also use this as a learning moment to show everyone that your local trend can go global and be mindful of what you're propagating in your content.\"\n\nTikTok has removed some videos about the trend. \n\n\"TikTok is a platform for positive, creative expression,\"a spokeswoman said.\"Keeping our community safe is a top priority: our community guidelines make it clear what is not acceptable on our platform, and any content or account that violates these guidelines will be removed.\"\nTL;DR: A viral TikTok trend in India has been accused of promoting colourism.\n\nArticle: Half the volunteers are from Scotland. The rest are from countries as far afield as the US and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nOrganisers said the numbers showed the\"excitement\"there was for the event.\n\nThe STUC had criticised the scheme for attracting\"middle-class golf fans\"rather than providing jobs for local people.\n\nRyder Cup Europe director Richard Hills said:\"We are extremely excited by the prospect of bringing the Ryder Cup to Scotland and this demonstrates the strength of interest and excitement in the event, particularly amongst the Scottish public.\"\n\nVolunteers will fill roles such as scoreboard carriers, safety marshals and merchandise sellers and are required to pay a \u00a375 fee to cover the cost of clothing and food.\n\nThe STUC's assistant secretary, Ian Tasker, has called for the jobs to be offered as paid positions to\"provide some step-up to individuals in these communities that might see them making that journey into long-term employment\".\n\nThe Scottish government has estimated the Ryder Cup will generate an estimated \u00a3100m for the local economy in the week of the tournament.\n\nVolunteers can still apply until midnight on 14 April.

It would be a seven day a week operation, working 12 hours a day,\"says managing director Andrew Jacques.\n\nA challenge comparable to the Ark Royal was presented to its workers when the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau arrived early in 2009.\n\nThe first step is to find out what hazardous substances are on board, says Jacques.\n\nIn the Clemenceau's case this included everything from 1,000 tonnes of asbestos to oils and polluted water - factors which led to protests at the decision to scrap it in the UK.\n\nIt is the owners' responsibility to provide the details, after which the breakers' yard draws up a plan. \n\nThe Ministry of Defence says the work to prepare the Ark Royal began soon after it was retired in early 2011.\n\nAll equipment has been removed and\"all potentially hazardous waste, including asbestos, has been permanently removed or, if integral to the ship, has been catalogued in detail so its proper removal can be monitored\". \n\nAt Able UK, ships are grounded in a dry dock.\n\nSeveral vessels would be brought in at the same time as an aircraft carrier to make the most of the workforce and equipment.\n\nEven when a ship is in place, it is some time before it meets its demise.\n\nUp to two months can be spent carrying out a more detailed environmental survey, after which\"windows\"are cut to provide ventilation.\n\nA team of 150 asbestos workers then starts work. Other hazardous materials are also tackled - tanks, for example, are pumped out through holes cut in the side of the ship.\n\nAsbestos is buried in Able UK's on-site landfill, while other contaminants like oil and polluted water are processed at an on-site treatment facility.\n\nThe main part of the cleaning process takes about 12 months but the process continues.\n\n\"Because of the dead spaces and areas that you can't see you have to approach it with care... there will inevitably be voids and double bottomed tanks [with] oils that you couldn't see,\"says Jacques.\n\nA cleaning team continues working even after work to break up the ship starts.\n\nSections of between 50 to 200 tonnes are removed from either end of a ship, using large hydraulic excavators, workers with cutting torches and cranes. A 3D model is used to work out how to safely proceed.\n\n\"If it's opened up it just looks like egg boxes all piled on top of each other - different rooms and compartments,\"says Jacques. \n\nA pair of 150 tonne excavators are then used to transport the pieces to a nearby area where hydraulic shears and gas torches are used to cut them into\"furnace-sized scrap\"of around 5ft by 2ft (1.5m by 60 cm).\n\nIt was 10 months from the time that pieces started\"dropping\"from the Clemenceau to the end of the cutting work. That's about one man hour a tonne, says Jacques.\n\nFrom there, pieces are taken to the steel plant. Along the way re-usable parts of the ship - like pumps and pipes - will have been stripped and sold off.\n\nIn the case of the Clemenceau, 98.2% was reused or recycled, says Jacques.\n\nExactly how a ship is scrapped varies between yards, although many now adhere to the standards set out by the Hong Kong Convention. This was proposed - but is still to be formally adopted - because of environmental and health and safety concerns over practices in some countries, including Bangladesh and Pakistan where ships are scrapped on the beach.\n\nIn the case of the Ark Royal it will first be secured on a slipway, says Robin Townsend of Lloyd's Register, who has worked with Leyal in Turkey.\n\nWork to dismantle it will start at the front, with sections of up to about 20 tonnes removed from the superstructure and upper decks first. For those involved it can be hot and physically demanding work.\n\n\"There are large areas of the ship which can be extremely loud, with overpowering smell of fuels and oil,\"says Townsend.\n\nFor those who work on areas like the oil tanks there is also an assault on the senses,\"with literally gangs of workers wielding hammers so it is like standing inside a huge steel drum\".\n\nAnother of the Royal Navy's carriers, HMS Invincible, was dismantled by Leyal in 2011, a job which took 10 months.\n\nThe firm has also scrapped Type 42 destroyers including HMS Cardiff, HMS Newcastle, HMS Glasgow, HMS Exeter, HMS Southampton and HMS Nottingham.\n\nFor HMS Illustrious, the third and final of the Royal Navy's Invincible Class aircraft carriers, there is a possible reprieve.\n\nDue to retire in 2014 it would provide plenty more metal for Turkey's furnaces, but the MoD hopes to preserve it as a\"lasting tribute to the work of the Invincible Class\".\n\nYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook\nTL;DR: The Royal Navy's former flagship, HMS Ark Royal, is to be towed to a breakers' yard in Turkey.

Do you think you are stronger than those Iraqi militias behind whom the Americans are standing?\"it says. \n\nThe statement appears to be a rebuff to a direct appeal by the Taliban for unity between the two groups.\n\nIn a statement to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Taliban said that there could not be\"two flags\"in the insurgency in Afghanistan. \n\nIt said that it would\"result in mujahideen strength being fragmented.\"\n\nBut in contrast, during their offensive in Nangarhar, IS supporters have been seen urging people to kill the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar.\n\nThey argue that there is already one caliph - Baghdadi.\n\nSecurity challenge\n\nThe first signs of\"IS in Khorasan\"were in Pakistan's frontier region in January.\n\nA number of ex-Taliban fighters, including one Afghan commander, pledged allegiance to the new group. \n\nNow, backing up IS threats, pictures of Taliban fighters being both beheaded and shot have appeared on social media in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nThe new battles are a complex security challenge for Afghan forces in their first summer of fighting without international combat support on the ground. \n\nGen Swindell said that Afghan special forces are conducting around 130 raids a week. \n\nOnly in a handful was there direct support by international troops. Even then, it was not in a combat role but involved advising in command and control centres.\n\nGen Swindell said that Farah province in the west is also facing threats from the new movement. They were in a\"competition for resources\"with the Taliban.\n\nThe fighting has led to renewed misery for Afghan civilians caught between the two sides. \n\nThousands of people have fled their homes to avoid the fighting in Nangarhar. \n\nThis year has seen more than 4,200 civilians killed or injured across the country. It look as if it will set a dismal new record of the highest casualties by the end of the year, topping even 2014.",

According to independent estimates, more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the\"re-education\"of the Uighurs and other minorities.\n\nHuman rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation.\n\nThe policy flows from China's President, Xi Jinping, who visited Xinjiang in 2014 in the wake of a terror attack by Uighur separatists. Shortly after, according to documents leaked to the New York Times, he directed local officials to respond with\"absolutely no mercy\". The US government said last month that China's actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are\"lies and absurd allegations\".\n\nFirst-hand accounts from inside the internment camps are rare, but several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.\n\nTursunay Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US, said women were removed from the cells\"every night\"and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men.\n\nZiawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she\"lived in constant fear of being sent back to China\", she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said.\n\nIt is impossible to verify Ziawudun's account completely because of the severe restrictions China places on reporters in the country, but travel documents and immigration records she provided to the BBC corroborate the timeline of her story. Her descriptions of the camp in Xinyuan county - known in Uighur as Kunes county - match satellite imagery analysed by the BBC, and her descriptions of daily life inside the camp, as well as the nature and methods of the abuse, correspond with other accounts from former detainees.\n\nInternal documents from the Kunes county justice system from 2017 and 2018, provided to the BBC by Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, detail planning and spending for\"transformation through education\"of\"key groups\"- a common euphemism in China for the indoctrination of the Uighurs. In one Kunes document, the\"education\"process is described as\"washing brains, cleansing hearts, strengthening righteousness and eliminating evil\". \n\nThe BBC also interviewed a Kazakh woman from Xinjiang who was detained for 18 months in the camp system, who said she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them, before leaving them alone with Chinese men. Afterwards, she cleaned the rooms, she said.\n\n\"My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move,\"said Gulzira Auelkhan, crossing her wrists behind her head to demonstrate.\"Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter - some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower.\"\n\nThe Chinese men\"would pay money to have their pick of the prettiest young inmates\", she said.\n\nSome former detainees of the camps have described being forced to assist guards or face punishment. Auelkhan said she was powerless to resist or intervene.\n\nAsked if there was a system of organised rape, she said:\"Yes, rape.\"\n\n\"They forced me to go into that room,\"she said.\"They forced me to take off those women's clothes and to restrain their hands and leave the room.\"\n\nSome of the women who were taken away from the cells at night were never returned, Ziawudun said. Those who were brought back were threatened against telling others in the cell what had happened to them.\n\n\"You can't tell anyone what happened, you can only lie down quietly,\"she said.\"It is designed to destroy everyone's spirit.\"\n\nMr Zenz told the BBC that the testimony gathered for this story was\"some of the most horrendous evidence I have seen since the atrocity began\".\n\n\"This confirms the very worst of what we have heard before,\"he said.\"It provides authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed.\"\n\nThe Uighurs are a mostly Muslim Turkic minority group that number about 11 million in Xinjiang in north-western China. The region borders Kazakhstan and is also home to ethnic Kazakhs. Ziawudun, who is 42, is Uighur. Her husband is a Kazakh.\n\nThe couple returned to Xinjiang in late 2016 after a five-year stay in Kazakhstan, and were interrogated on arrival and had their passports confiscated, Ziawudun said. A few months later, she was told by police to attend a meeting alongside other Uighurs and Kazakhs and the group was rounded up and detained. \n\nHer first stint in detention was comparatively easy, she said, with decent food and access to her phone. After a month she developed stomach ulcers and was released. Her husband's passport was returned and he went back to Kazakhstan to work, but authorities kept Ziawudun's, trapping her in Xinjiang. Reports suggest China has purposefully kept behind and interned relatives to discourage those who leave from speaking out. On 9 March 2018, with her husband still in Kazakhstan, Ziawudun was instructed to report to a local police station, she said. She was told she needed\"more education\".\n\nAccording to her account, Ziawudun was transported back to the same facility as her previous detention, in Kunes county, but the site had been significantly developed, she said. Buses were lined up outside offloading new detainees\"non-stop\".\n\nThe women had their jewellery confiscated. Ziawudun's earrings were yanked out, she said, causing her ears to bleed, and she was herded into a room with a group of women. Among them was an elderly woman who Ziawudun would later befriend.\n\nThe camp guards pulled off the woman's headscarf, Ziawudun said, and shouted at her for wearing a long dress - one of a list of religious expressions that became arrestable offences for Uighurs that year.\n\n\"They stripped everything off the elderly lady, leaving her with just her underwear. She was so embarrassed that she tried to cover herself with her arms,\"Ziawudun said.\n\n\"I cried so much watching the way they treated her. Her tears fell like rain.\"\n\nThe women were told to hand over their shoes and any clothes with elastic or buttons, Ziawudun said, then taken to cellblocks -\"similar to a small Chinese neighbourhood where there are rows of buildings\".\n\nNothing much happened for the first month or two. They were forced to watch propaganda programmes in their cells and had their hair forcibly cut short.\n\nThen police began interrogating Ziawudun about her absent husband, she said, knocking her on the floor when she resisted and kicking her in the abdomen.\n\n\"Police boots are very hard and heavy, so at first I thought he was beating me with something,\"she said.\"Then I realised that he was trampling on my belly. I almost passed out - I felt a hot flush go through me.\"\n\nA camp doctor told her she might have a blood clot. When her cellmates drew attention to the fact that she was bleeding, the guards\"replied saying it is normal for women to bleed\", she said.\n\nAccording to Ziawudun, each cell was home to 14 women, with bunk beds, bars on the windows, a basin and a hole-in-the-floor-style toilet. When she first saw women being taken out of the cell at night, she didn't understand why, she said. She thought they were being moved elsewhere.\n\nThen sometime in May 2018 -\"I don't remember the exact date, because you don't remember the dates inside there\"- Ziawudun and a cellmate, a woman in her twenties, were taken out at night and presented to a Chinese man in a mask, she said. Her cellmate was taken into a separate room.\n\n\"As soon as she went inside she started screaming,\"Ziawudun said.\"I don't know how to explain to you, I thought they were torturing her. I never thought about them raping.\"\n\nThe woman who had brought them from the cells told the men about Ziawudun's recent bleeding.\n\n\"After the woman spoke about my condition, the Chinese man swore at her. The man with the mask said'Take her to the dark room'.\n\n\"The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn't know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock.\"\n\nZiawudun's torture that first night in the dark room eventually came to an end, she said, when the woman intervened again citing her medical condition, and she was returned to the cell.\n\nAbout an hour later, her cellmate was brought back.\n\n\"The girl became completely different after that, she wouldn't speak to anyone, she sat quietly staring as if in a trance,\"Ziawudun said.\"There were many people in those cells who lost their minds.\"\n\nAlongside cells, another central feature of the camps is classrooms. Teachers have been drafted in to\"re-educate\"the detainees - a process activists say is designed to strip the Uighurs and other minorities of their culture, language and religion, and indoctrinate them into mainstream Chinese culture.\n\nQelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, was among the Chinese language teachers brought into the camps and coerced into giving lessons to the detainees. Sedik has since fled China and spoken publicly about her experience.  \n\nThe women's camp was\"tightly controlled\", Sedik told the BBC. But she heard stories, she said - signs and rumours of rape. One day, Sedik cautiously approached a Chinese camp policewoman she knew.\n\n\"I asked her,'I have been hearing some terrible stories about rape, do you know about it?' She said we should talk in the courtyard during lunch.\n\n\"So I went to the courtyard, where there were not many cameras. She said,'Yes, the rape has become a culture. It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture.'\"\n\nThat night Sedik didn't sleep at all, she said.\"I was thinking about my daughter who was studying abroad and I cried all night.\"\n\nIn separate testimony to the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Sedik said she heard about an electrified stick being inserted into women to torture them - echoing the experience Ziawudun described. \n\nThere were\"four kinds of electric shock\", Sedik said -\"the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick\".\n\n\"The screams echoed throughout the building,\"she said.\"I could hear them during lunch and sometimes when I was in class.\"\n\nAnother teacher forced to work in the camps, Sayragul Sauytbay, told the BBC that\"rape was common\"and the guards\"picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away\".\n\nShe described witnessing a harrowing public gang rape of a woman of just 20 or 21, who was brought before about 100 other detainees to make a forced confession.\n\n\"After that, in front of everyone, the police took turns to rape her,\"Sauytbay said.\n\n\"While carrying out this test, they watched people closely and picked out anyone who resisted, clenched their fists, closed their eyes, or looked away, and took them for punishment.\"\n\nThe young woman cried out for help, Sauytbay said. \n\n\"It was absolutely horrendous,\"she said.\"I felt I had died. I was dead.\"\n\nIn the camp in Kunes, Ziawudun's days drifted into weeks and then months. The detainees' hair was cut, they went to class, they underwent unexplained medical tests, took pills, and were forcibly injected every 15 days with a\"vaccine\"that brought on nausea and numbness.\n\nWomen were forcibly fitted with IUDs or sterilised, Ziawudun said, including a woman who was just about 20 years old. (\"We begged them on her behalf,\"she said.) Forced sterilisation of Uighurs has been widespread in Xinjiang, according to a recent investigation by the Associated Press. The Chinese government told the BBC the allegations were\"completely unfounded\".\n\nAs well as the medical interventions, detainees in Ziawudun's camp spent hours singing patriotic Chinese songs and watching patriotic TV programmes about Chinese President Xi Jinping, she said.\n\n\"You forget to think about life outside the camp. I don't know if they brainwashed us or if it was the side effect of the injections and pills, but you can't think of anything beyond wishing you had a full stomach. The food deprivation is so severe.\"\n\nDetainees had food withheld for infractions such as failing to accurately memorise passages from books about Xi Jinping, according to a former camp guard who spoke to the BBC via video link from a country outside China.\n\n\"Once we were taking the people arrested into the concentration camp, and I saw everyone being forced to memorise those books. They sit for hours trying to memorise the text, everyone had a book in their hands,\"he said.\n\nThose who failed tests were forced to wear three different colours of clothing based on whether they had failed one, two, or three times, he said, and subjected to different levels of punishment accordingly, including food deprivation and beatings.\n\n\"I entered those camps. I took detainees into those camps,\"he said.\"I saw those sick, miserable people. They definitely experienced various types of torture. I am sure about that.\"\n\nIt was not possible to independently verify the guard's testimony but he provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp. He agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe guard said he did not know anything about rape in the cell areas. Asked if the camp guards used electrocution, he said:\"Yes. They do. They use those electrocuting instruments.\"After being tortured, detainees were forced to make confessions to a variety of perceived offences, according to the guard.\"I have those confessions in my heart,\"he said.\n\nPresident Xi looms large over the camps. His image and slogans adorn the walls; he is a focus of the programme of\"re-education\". Xi is the overall architect of the policy against the Uighurs, said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat in China and now senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. \n\n\"It is very centralised and it goes to the very top,\"Parton said.\"There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this is Xi Jinping's policy.\"\n\nIt was unlikely that Xi or other top party officials would have directed or authorised rape or torture, Parton said, but they would\"certainly be aware of it\".\n\n\"I think they prefer at the top just to turn a blind eye. The line has gone out to implement this policy with great sternness, and that is what is happening.\"That left\"no real constraints\", he said.\"I just don't see what the perpetrators of these acts would have to hold them back.\"\n\nAccording to Ziawudun's account, the perpetrators did not hold back.\n\n\"They don't only rape but also bite all over your body, you don't know if they are human or animal,\"she said, pressing a tissue to her eyes to stop her tears and pausing for a long time to collect herself.\n\n\"They didn't spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.\n\n\"I've experienced that three times. And it is not just one person who torments you, not just one predator. Each time they were two or three men.\"\n\nLater, a woman who slept near Ziawudun in the cell, who said she was detained for giving birth to too many children, disappeared for three days and when she returned her body was covered with the same marks, Ziawudun said.\n\n\"She couldn't say it. She wrapped her arms around my neck and sobbed continuously, but she said nothing.\"\n\nThe Chinese government did not respond directly to questions from the BBC about allegations of rape and torture. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the camps in Xinjiang were not detention camps but\"vocational education and training centres\".\n\n\"The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities equally,\"the spokeswoman said, adding that the government\"attaches great importance to protecting women's rights\".\n\nZiawudun was released in December 2018 along with others who had spouses or relatives in Kazakhstan - an apparent policy shift she still doesn't fully understand. \n\nThe state returned her passport and she fled to Kazakhstan and then, with the support of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, to the US. She is applying to stay. She lives in a quiet suburb not far from Washington DC with a landlady from the local Uighur community. The two women cook together and take walks in the streets around the house. It's a slow, uneventful existence. Ziawudun keeps the lights low when she is in the house, because they shone brightly and constantly in the camp. A week after she arrived in the US, she had surgery to remove her womb - a consequence of being stamped on.\"I have lost the chance to become a mother,\"she said. She wants her husband to join her in the US. For now, he is in Kazakhstan.\n\nFor a while after her release, before she could flee, Ziawudun waited in Xinjiang. She saw others who had been churned through the system and released. She saw the effect the policy was having on her people. The birth rate in Xinjiang has plummeted in the past few years, according to independent research - an effect analysts have described as\"demographic genocide\".\n\nMany in the community had turned to alcohol, Ziawudun said. Several times, she saw her former cellmate collapsed on the street - the young woman who was removed from the cell with her that first night, who she heard screaming in an adjacent room. The woman had been consumed by addiction, Ziawudun said. She was\"like someone who simply existed, otherwise she was dead, completely finished by the rapes\".\n\n\"They say people are released, but in my opinion everyone who leaves the camps is finished.\"\n\nAnd that, she said, was the plan. The surveillance, the internment, the indoctrination, the dehumanisation, the sterilisation, the torture, the rape.\n\n\"Their goal is to destroy everyone,\"she said.\"And everybody knows it.\"\n\nPhotographs by Hannah Long-Higgins\n\nReaders in the UK affected by sexual abuse or violence can find support information via the BBC website here.\n\nMore coverage of China's camps\nTL;DR:

In 2004, the UK was the only major country not to have controls on migrants coming from Poland and more than 600,000 arrived in Britain. \n\nThis time, he said,  Bulgarians and Romanians would have the choice of many countries including Germany and including places like Italy and Spain where there are already Romanian communities. \n\nMost importantly, the minister tried to shut the door on a proposal that the government should extent the current controls beyond New Year's Day. \n\n\"It simply isn't legally possible,\"he said.\"Treaties would have to be amended. It would not be complicit with treaty obligations.\"\n\nAnd then came the polls. By a huge majority those polled did not want a new round of immigration. Some 85% feared schools and hospitals could not cope. \n\nThe issue touches on sensitive issues like control of borders and who, ultimately, is responsible for the benefits system. The polls reflect a deep mistrust about earlier commitments made by politicians to establish a\"firm control over immigration\".  \n\nWage gulf\n\nAnd then came the hints that the government was examining extending the period before Bulgarians and Romanians would be able to claim benefits. They might have to live in the UK for up to a year before they would qualify.  They would not, for instance, be able to seek the job-seeker's allowance on arrival. \n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove said:\"When it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the EU, we need to look properly at the benefits system here to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute, not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was the prospect of Prime Minister David Cameron defying the EU, for member states are barred from discriminating between their own citizens and migrants from other EU states. To breach that regulation would almost certainly trigger a legal row which would end up before the European Court of Justice.\n\nI was in Bulgaria last week. It is hard to assess the numbers who will migrate, let alone to Britain, but there are plenty of people who say they will make the journey. \n\nIn the end, the discrepancies in wages are too hard to resist. The average annual wage in Bulgaria is about \u00a34,000 compared to \u00a326,000 in the UK. My colleague Emma Jane Kirby found Bulgarian doctors hoping to earn ten times as much in Germany or the UK.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski told me:\"For sure some Bulgarians will try and work in Britain. Most of them will look for proper work rather than taking advantage of the welfare system.\"\n\nBut the fear remains that some immigrants will not look for, or find, regular work.\n\nSo some EU countries are agonising over how to respond to the lifting of travel and work restrictions. The Times reports that 16 German cities have written to Chancellor Angela Merkel saying they cannot cope with the new arrivals and asking for emergency help from the beginning of next year. Some German politicians openly agree with some of the concerns raised in the UK. \n\n\"If Britain wants to enforce its welfare laws better,\"says Peter Wilding, director of the pro-EU lobby group British Influence,\"it has, like the Germans, a wellspring of European goodwill to do so and the allies to push it through\". \n\nDefiance\n\nSo what is to be done? For David Cameron there are no easy choices. To defy the EU would cause more than a ripple within his coalition. Some Liberal Democrats would resent a further row with Brussels.\n\nIn Europe, some countries would see it as another example of the UK's alienation from the European project. It might make re-negotiation  of terms of membership more difficult - but defiance might prove popular with voters.\n\nThis controversy raises wider themes. The freedom to move and work in the EU is regarded as a core achievement. Many have taken advantage of it. \n\nBut times are difficult and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Despite the billions that have been spent on trying to reduce the inequality between countries like Romania and Bulgaria  and the rest of the EU, the standards of living are very different. It reveals just how difficult it is to bring the economies of all 28 EU members closer together.\n\nIt is also a period of tension between what governments want and their EU obligations. Yesterday the streets of Paris were filled with riding enthusiasts and their horses protesting against an increase sales tax on riding schools, imposed via a European Commission directive with the backing of the European Court of Justice. \n\nIt has triggered the anger of the 2.3 million people who ride. The French government says it is sympathetic to the protests and may try to renegotiate the directive but, in the short term, it will not defy Brussels. \n\nDefiance is a big step, and the UK may have a significant number of allies if it seeks temporary relief from the lifting of restrictions on 1 January.\nTL;DR: Last week the UK's Immigration Minister Mark Harper tried to calm the rising agitation about migrants arriving in the New Year from Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nArticle: Social media was buzzing with Beyonce's headline set, The Weeknd\"crying\"and a pregnant Cardi B twerking. \n\nAround 100,000 fans are expected in California for the two-week festival which runs until 22 April. \n\nIf the cost of flights and a hotel, plus the \u00a3300 tickets meant you couldn't be there, here's a rundown of the best bits.\n\nBeyonce and the return of Destiny's Child\n\nOnce again the the 36-year-old singer showed why she's considered one of the world's greatest entertainers. \n\nB opened her two-hour set surrounded by dancers in military-themed costumes before husband Jay-Z joined her for a rendition of her 2003 hit, Crazy In Love.\n\nIf the venue had a roof, it would've come off, when Beyonce was joined onstage by Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.\n\nIt's the first time the trio, aka Destiny's Child, have appeared together since the Stellar Gospel Music Awards in 2015.\n\nBeyonce was due to headline Coachella last year but pulled out due to the fact she was pregnant with twins Rumi and Sir. \n\nJudging by the reaction on social media, it was worth wait. \n\nAt one point Beyonce was responsible for 15 of Twitter's 20 trending positions.\n\nWe are used to numerous costume changes but some eagle-eyed fans even spotted that Beyonce executed a nail change during her set. \n\nJustin Bieber and'Walmart Yodel Boy'\n\nWhat do you mean who?\n\nWalmart Yodel Boy is actually 11-year-old Mason Ramsey. He became a viral sensation after a video of him singing in the aisle of a supermarket was uploaded.\n\nMore than 20 million views later and appearances on shows like the Ellen Degeneres Show - Mason was invited by Coachella to perform. \n\nMason admitted he had been bullied and trolled because of the video but no doubt he got the last laugh when it turns out Justin Bieber is a fan. \n\nThe pair met backstage at the festival and had a chat before posing for pictures.\n\nA pregnant Cardi B twerking\n\nBeing pregnant may have stopped Beyonce performing last year but it didn't stop Cardi B this year.\n\nThe rapper, who confirmed her pregnancy earlier this month, ran through hits from her debut album Invasion of Privacy. \n\nShe was also joined by Chance the Rapper and G-Eazy during her set. \n\nAlthough the 28-year-old twerking was the moment most fans were gushing about online. \n\nWizkid's no show\n\nObviously not a Coachella highlight because the Nigerian singer failed to make it to the festival.\n\nAlthough the musician hasn't confirmed the reasons why, it seems his team didn't have the right travel documents to make the trip. \n\nCoachella has announced that he will be performing during the second week of the event instead. \n\nWhere's Eminem?\n\nIt was left to Eminem to close out the first weekend of the festival when he headlined on Sunday night. \n\nBut fans were left frustrated when the set wasn't available on the official Coachella YouTube page.\n\nThis fan seemed to offer a suitable explanation as to why the show wasn't live streamed. \n\nLooks like anyone hoping to catch it online missed a decent show. Em was joined on stage by 50 Cent, Dr Dre and Bebe Rexha. \n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. \n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.\nTL;DR: Hands up if your timeline was flooded with news from Coachella this weekend? You're not alone.\n\nArticle: Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter\n\nToday, the government defines extremism as\"vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs\". \n\nIt goes on to say that Islamist extremism is an ideology that accuses the West of perpetrating a war on Islam.\n\nIf that definition is now clear, it wasn't always so. \n\nBack in the early 1990s, London became a hub for an international network of predominantly Arab Islamist thinkers, many of whom had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan.\n\nThese former fighters were seeking safe havens because their support for Islamic states meant they posed a security threat to the despotic regimes in their own countries. \n\nThey persuaded the UK that they would not pose an extremist threat here and were allowed to settle. \n\nThis uneasy situation didn't last. Jihadists - such as the preacher Abu Hamza -  ultimately supported Osama bin Laden's anti-Western message. The 9/11 attacks served only to convince critics that the UK's security services had made a catastrophic error of judgement and allowed extremism to flourish.\n\nBanned \n\nIn the wake of the later 7/7 attacks on London, Tony Blair's government signalled it would not only hunt down suspected terrorists, but also turn its attention to anyone promoting the ideology that could be linked to violence. \n\nThere were proposals to close extremist mosques, bookshops and other organisations. The government broadened the range of terrorism offences and banned one group whose members had committed terrorism offences. \n\nMany parts of this package were dropped because of disagreements in Whitehall over what constituted extremism.  \n\nFor instance, Tony Blair said he would ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group that supports a single Islamic state. Despite David Cameron making the same pledge while in opposition, the group remains legal to this day. \n\nInside Whitehall, officials tried to work out which community groups were best placed to receive more than \u00a350m earmarked for projects designed to prevent extremism. \n\nBut in hindsight, many of the bets were poorly placed. While many groups took the cash and used it to do some local good, a great deal of them didn't seem to have any means to combat extremism - not least because nobody seemed to agree what it was. \n\nIn the end, a highly critical report from MPs accused the government of alienating some of the many people it was trying to reach. \n\nIntegration or separation?\n\nDavid Cameron came into office with (whether you agree with it or not) a much clearer definition of what constituted extremism. Michael Gove, the education secretary at the centre of the Birmingham Trojan Horse affair, was one of the architects of what became known as the Munich speech. \n\nIn it the PM said the government needed to be\"shrewder\"in dealing with groups that were part of the problem, even if they were not violent themselves. \n\nHe said that groups wishing to work with government had to pass tests such as whether they believed in human rights, including for women, the rule of law and democracy. Did they encourage integration or separation? \n\nIn other words, his definition of extremism comes down to a question of whether society fractures into\"us and them\". \n\nIn that context, it's not hard to see why the Birmingham schools affair has become so important to ministers. \n\nToo extreme\n\nSince the Munich speech, the government has massively cut funding to Muslim community groups that it felt did not meet these tests. \n\nOne of the groups that lost out was a south London-based organisation called Street. It previously had the ear of some in Scotland Yard because it had intervened to stop gang violence and al-Qaeda recruitment. \n\nIn the new landscape, it was deemed to be too extreme because its members tended to follow a very conservative Saudi-influenced interpretation of the faith. \n\nStreet's founder told the BBC last year that the organisation had identified one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby as a possible threat - and he believed he could have been turned away from violence had his group still been operating. \n\nThe prime minister's Extremism Task Force, set up after the murder, doesn't analyse whether the killers could have been stopped. But it cements the government's current broader definition of extremism. \n\nThe definition it uses, outlined at the top of this blog, is much clearer than it once was - and the detailed guidance makes clear that schools should support\"British values\". \n\nSeven years ago, the future Education Secretary Michael Gove wrote that\"there is something rather un-British about seeking to define Britishness\".\n\nHe argued that Britishness was something best demonstrated through action rather than described in abstract terms. \n\nAnd that's why the state of a small number of predominantly Muslim schools in Birmingham, and how the government and other bodies propose to change them, may turn out to be one of the defining moments in modern multicultural Britain.\nTL;DR: The Birmingham Trojan Horse row has reignited a long and difficult debate over defining Islamist extremism.\n\nArticle: Loteri Cymru praised its\"growing base of loyal weekly players\"but said it was not enough to make the venture financially viable.\n\nThe directors have filed a notice of intention in court to put the company into administration.\n\nDuring their operating period on S4C they distributed \u00a3120,000 to charitable causes in Wales and over \u00a3350,000 in prize money, with a jackpot of \u00a325,000.\n\nLoteri Cymru has not confirmed what will happen to funds that remain in players' accounts, and said it hopes to make a\"positive statement on the website\"following the appointment of an administrator.\n\nThe lottery announced it is in discussions with\"several interested parties\"and is\"hopeful that the business can be sold\".\nTL;DR: Wales' televised lottery has ceased operating after 11 months.\n\nArticle: By Daniel DaviesBBC Wales news website political reporter\n\nAndrew RT Davies, who is at the Conservative party conference, accused Labour of\"governing for the sake of it\".\n\nMr Davies was elected leader of the Tories in the assembly in July.\n\nHe hailed the Welsh Conservatives as a\"very strong brand\"and told BBC Wales he wanted to lead a\"consensual party\".\n\nMr Davies said Welsh Tories were heading to the conference in Manchester in\"good heart\"after a positive result at May's assembly election.\n\nThey won 14 seats, pushing Plaid Cymru into third place for the first time.\n\nWith Labour occupying half the Senedd's 60 seats, there could be opportunities for opposition parties to team up against the Welsh Government.\n\n'Makes sense'\n\nMr Davies, who addressed the conference on Sunday, ruled out any\"backroom deals\"with other parties.\n\n\"Ultimately what we want to be is a consensual party here in Wales that people can reach across and say'Yes, I can see what the Conservatives are doing and it makes sense',\"the leader said.\n\n\"Now if we can get into coalition or other parties want to come into coalition with us my door is always open.\n\n\"But what we have to make sure is that we have the confidence of the people and we have the genuine policy ideas that will improve services here in Wales and will improve people's lives here in Wales.\n\n\"There's no point governing for the sake for the sake of governance, and that's what Labour are doing at the moment.\"\n\nFollowing a week when First Minister Carwyn Jones published his programme for government, Mr Davies said Labour was\"void of ideas, void of inspiration\"and\"they are in power because they just believe they have a God-given right to rule in Wales\".\n\n'For the people'\n\n\"That is not good for Wales, it's not good for democracy, and above all we can see exactly what the problems are and we want to sort them out,\"he told BBC Wales\n\nSome in the party have suggested the Welsh Tories should do more to stress their differences from the Conservatives in England.\n\nBut Mr Davies said:\"Let me tell you clearly - Welsh Conservatives is a very strong brand that we are all very proud of fighting elections on.\n\n\"And we have our own party board, we have our own party chairman, and we have our own policy making.\n\n\"So when people vote at assembly elections they can be quite clear that they are voting on policy initiatives that are developed in Wales for the people of Wales.\n\nIn his speech on Sunday, Mr Davies attacked Labour's record on the economy, health and education in Wales.\n\nHe said despite millions of pounds being spent on economic programmes, Wales has become the poorest part of the UK.\n\n'Tablet tax'\n\n\"Whilst Labour has spent millions of pounds on bureaucracy, Welsh pupils have been forced to suffer what the education minister admits is'systemic failure' in our schools,\"Mr Davies told the conference.\n\nHe said there were also 24 cancer drugs available in England which were not available to patients in Wales and Labour was cutting the NHS budget.\n\nMr Davies added:\"Welsh Labour promised to stand up for Wales. Instead they've given us a stand-up routine like Cannon and Ball.\"\n\nA source close to the Welsh health minister Lesley Griffiths hit back, saying Welsh patients were not subject to a\"tablet tax\"on prescriptions, while unlike in England,  waiting lists were not running out of control. \n\n\"We already spend approximately \u00a35 more per head of population than England on cancer treatment,\"said the source.\"Even with the additional \u00a3200m available in England, it is still less than what we spend per head in Wales.\"\nTL;DR: The leader of the opposition in the Welsh Assembly has said his \"door is always open\" to potential coalition partners.\n\nArticle: North Wales Police say they were called at 13:07 GMT to the incident involving a twin engine light aircraft.\n\nThe man was pronounced dead at the scene and the woman was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where she later died.

I don't like that.\"\n\nThe online response to the #MulvaneyCough has been mixed, with some joking that it's the first time the divisive president has been relatable, while others say it shows what an insensitive boss he must be.\n\nThough Mr Trump's ire seemed mostly due to the interruption, his distaste for coughing isn't surprising - the president is a self-professed germaphobe.\n\nA 2005 book, The World According to Trump, quoted him as saying:\"I mean, they have medical reports all the time. Shaking hands, you catch colds, you catch the flu, you catch this. You catch all sorts of things. Who knows what you don't catch?\"\n\nBut Mr Trump is not the only famous face with a distaste for coughing and sneezing - Vince McMahon, an American pro-wrestling executive, reportedly has a no-sneezing rule around him.\n\nAnd Obama-era Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius also once scolded a journalist during a press briefing for not sneezing into his elbow, half-jokingly calling for hand sanitiser and a lesson on how to sneeze properly.\n\nSo what is the best way to sneeze or cough in a public place?\n\nThe etiquette of being ill...\n\nCrystal L Bailey, director of the Etiquette Institute of Washington, says:\"The idea is to avoid people as much as possible when you do need to sneeze or cough.\n\n\"There was a time when we would have used handkerchiefs, but if there's a tissue available or if you're able to sneeze into your elbow... make sure that happens. That you move yourself and your mouth and face in the opposite direction of anyone else.\"\n\nIf that isn't possible - say, on a crowded train - Ms Bailey advises trying to get to an elbow, not a hand, so you avoid spreading germs on handrails or other surfaces people might touch.\n\nBut if you do end up sneezing or coughing close to someone else, apologise with an\"excuse me\". And if you feel a coughing fit coming on in a cinema or theatre, leaving the room is probably best.\n\nMs Bailey also noted that if you are sick, avoiding handshakes can be a respectable course of action.\n\n\"You need to say something and not just decline someone's handshake without giving them an explanation because that's a big faux-pas,\"she notes.\"But I think we would all appreciate not having to shake hands with someone who is sick.\"\n\nAnd if someone is not adhering to these rules of engagement, Ms Bailey recommends the gum approach.\n\n\"Maybe to offer a tissue, or signalling by yourself using hand sanitiser - it's like [if someone has bad breath] taking a piece of gum yourself and then offering it and hopefully it won't come across too badly.\"\n\n\"Other than that,\"she notes,\"the only behaviour we can truly control is ourselves.\"\n\n...and the medical reasons to follow it\n\nThe best way to limit transmission is to contain it in something that can be thrown away, says Dr Tenagne Haile-Mariam, assistant professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University.\n\n\"The best would be a tissue, and whatever you sneeze or cough is contained in that, then crumpled up with the contaminated side in.\"\n\nDirect contact with a sick person's bodily fluids - droplets or otherwise - is the most common way to catch a cold, but asking someone to leave a room to cough is not\"the be all end all\"to avoiding contracting their illness, says Dr Haile-Mariam, because\"coughing is not the only way to transmit\".\n\nIf they come back into your area and they touch their nose and face, you are no longer protected.\n\nSmall particulates, like viruses, can travel a maximum of six feet (1.8m) with a sneeze or cough, while larger droplets generally cannot go more than three feet, she says. But if someone coughs into their hand or an empty space, that matter can land on objects that others might touch. \n\nMost infectious particles do not survive outside the body for very long, but some can, like chicken pox or tuberculosis.\n\nWhat about other countries?\n\nBut in order to fall sick, there must be a\"critical amount\"of bacterial or viral particles, she says.\"We live in a world full of contaminants [but] your body's pretty good at getting rid of things unless it's overwhelmed.\"\n\nDr Haile-Mariam's best advice? Wash your hands - even if you aren't sick.\n\n\"Because you will touch a surface that someone has coughed or sneezed on or has put something they've coughed or sneezed into on,\"she says.\n\n\"When we're sick we're diligent as good citizens about not wanting to infect other people and we wash our hands and throw our tissues and so on. But if we're not sick we need to be just as diligent about washing our hands.\"\nTL;DR: US President Donald Trump set off conversations on cough etiquette after it emerged he asked an aide to leave the Oval Office for coughing during an interview.

delighted that our wonderful community-owned pier has won this prestigious award.\"\n\nThe pier, built by engineer Eugenius Birch, was prosperous during the mid-20th Century but it went into decline as holidaymakers travelled further afield.\n\nIt was closed for safety reasons in 2006 because it had fallen into disrepair, before fire tore through the structure four years later.\n\nWork to

conversion of chalets of a similar character in the area\"and could impact on tourism.  \n\nOfficers also said it would mean the chalets not being used for their intended purpose as holiday homes rather than permanent residences.\n\nHowever, a previous Swansea council committee had gone against the recommendation of its officers and backed Mr O'Sullivan's bid.\n\nThe miners' leader said he was shocked and disappointed but added he had not given up and would take the issue further.\n\nDonna Teesdale, one of Mr O'Sullivan's neighbours, said:\"If a property can be lived in for 10 months of the

It just seemed a sort of natural choice for us.\"\n\nOther new acts announced include MGMT, Brian Ferry, Kelis, Metronomy and De La Soul. \n\nRudimental, Manic Street Preachers, London Grammar and Ed Sheeran are also set to play across more than 100 stages at the festival in Somerset between 25-29 June.\n\nSaturday night's Pyramid Stage headliner is still yet to be announced, although Eavis said there was definitely one in place. \n\n\"We've got it all booked, it was all confirmed a couple of weeks ago. We can't give you that yet, just for contractual reasons, but it will be with you soon,\"she said. \n\n\"The full lineup, the thousands and thousands of acts, will be with you in May,\"she added.\"This is a few handpicked acts to give you a taster.\"\n\nRecently, acts such as Lana Del Rey and the Black Keys had confirmed their own appearances, joining Lily Allen, Disclosure, Blondie, Suzanne Vega and Warpaint on the bill.  \n\n'A big deal'\n\nIn February, Dolly Parton said she was\"incredibly excited\"to be playing the Sunday afternoon\"legend slot\"on the Pyramid Stage, following last year's appearance from her friend and contemporary Kenny Rogers. \n\nWhite Stripes star Jack White is set to play a exclusive UK festival date at Glastonbury's Pyramid stage. \n\n\"Getting Jack White was a really big deal for us, he's got a history here that goes way back,\"said Eavis.\n\n\"He's had some really brilliant moments here across all the stages. So when he said he wanted to play here and didn't want to do any other festivals, it means a lot to us.\"\n\nEavis said securing US alt-rock act Pixies was also\"a big deal\". \n\n\"They haven't played here since 1989, so that's been a long time coming,\"she said.  \n\nTickets for this year sold out in just one hour and 27 minutes in October, despite\"technical difficulties\"with online ticketing site See Tickets.  \n\nFestival goers who have paid their deposit have until just before midnight on Monday 7 April to pay their balance. Remaining tickets go on resale on  24 April for coach packages and 27 April for standard tickets.\nTL;DR: Glastonbury Festival has added another 87 names to the bill including Kasabian, Jack White, Elbow and MIA.\n\nArticle: The UK-led Beagle 2 Mars Lander was lost on Christmas Day in 2003 during a mission to search for signs of life on the Red Planet.\n\nBut the discovery of its remains 11 years later proves it landed successfully.\n\nDr Laurence Tyler and Dr Matt Gunn helped map the area it was found.\n\nThe pair, who work at the university's Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, were asked to provide detailed 3D images of the area where Beagle 2 was believed to have landed.\n\nUsing specialist computer software, Dr Tyler was able to provide a terrain map of the area from images taken by a camera on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\n\nBeagle 2 was led by Prof Colin Pillinger from the Open University, and Aberystwyth University space scientist Prof Dave Barnes helped develop the spacecraft's robotic arm. \n\nBoth died in 2014.\n\nDr Tyler said news of the discovery\"brought a lump to his throat\".\n\n\"I am very pleased to hear it sounds like Beagle 2 landed successfully but saddened that Dave is not around to see this,\"he said.\n\n\"He would have been absolutely thrilled that Beagle 2 landed safely and didn't just burn up in the atmosphere.\"\n\nThe robotic space craft descended to Mars from its mothership Mars Express in December 2003, but never sent back a radio signal to say that it had survived the landing.\n\nScientists tried to contact the probe, but never found out what went wrong.\n\nThe aim of its mission was to look for past or present life and see how mountains and rocks formed.\nTL;DR: Scientists at Aberystwyth University have helped in the discovery of the remains of a missing spacecraft on Mars.\n\nArticle: By Sarah MooreBBC News\n\nA new county newspaper has been launched in west Wales.\n\nThe Pembrokeshire Herald has been started by a businessman from Milford Haven and will be a weekly paper costing 50p. \n\nPembrokeshire is already served by another weekly paper, the Western Telegraph, which was founded in 1854, and which is now owned by Newsquest. \n\nThe editor of The Pembrokeshire Herald, Bruce Sinclair, said they saw a gap in the market.\n\n\"Launching a brand new independent newspaper title could be seen as a brave venture in this uncertain economic climate, but we at the Herald see a growing need for a county-wide voice for the people of Pembrokeshire,\"he said.\n\nThe Herald will have an initial print run of 20,000, and is being launched by Mega Group in Milford Haven, a company which is owned by Tom Sinclair. \n\nHe already runs an online radio station and publishes a free magazine called Pembrokeshire's Best.\n\n\"We worked it out that we'd be able to break even, even if no copies of the paper sold at all, based on the advertising revenues that we're receiving. If someone buys a copy, that's 50 pence for us,\"he said.\n\n\"We're hoping we'll sell lots of copies, but if it's a slow start, that's fine.\n\n\"We're going to be an independent voice. We're not going to be relying on revenue from local authorities or any government sources. It's a return to good old fashioned journalism.\"\n\nThe Pembrokeshire Herald is not the only independently-owned newspaper launched recently in Wales. \n\nThe Caerphilly Observer and the Port Talbot Magnet, both originally started online, have made a transition into print.\n\nMarket gap\n\nThe Caerphilly Observer started online in 2009, but since 30 May this year it has also been published as a weekly newspaper.\n\nIt is being written and published by one man, journalist Richard Gurner, who says he saw a gap in the market for a newspaper which serves the entire Caerphilly borough county. \n\nHe secured European funding to help him publish the first four editions, but after that he will be relying on advertising revenue.\n\n\"I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I could sustain it,\"he said.\n\n\"From a standing start the online paper gained a monthly average audience of 20,000 unique visitors a month, and we're still reaching out to new people.\"\n\nThe current print run of the paper is 10,000 copies. Mr Gurner said he wanted to reach readers who are digitally excluded.\n\n\"At the moment, it's just me and an advertising sales lady,\"he said.\n\n\"Students from the University of South Wales have also been helping me, but my dream is to increase revenue, get a town centre office, and employ some staff.\"\n\nThe Port Talbot Magnet was started as an online community newspaper following the closure of the town's local paper, The Port Talbot Guardian, in 2009.\n\nIn April this year the team behind the Magnet website announced their plan to start publishing a free monthly newspaper over the summer.\n\nThe launch of the new publications come while many newspapers in Wales continue to suffer from staffing and financial cuts and falling circulation figures.\n\nChoice\n\nGenuine concerns have been expressed in recent years regarding the future of the newspaper industry in Wales.\n\nRobert Lloyd, a former editor of both the Llanelli Star and the Carmarthen Journal, now owns his own media consultancy. He said he remains optimistic about the industry.\n\n\"These days it's all dominated by the big boys, the big corporations,\"he said.\n\n\"There's Local World, the former Northcliffe enterprise, Trinity Mirror, Newsquest, Ray Tindle. He's a small newspaper publisher but he's a national newspaper publisher.\n\n\"The days of old family, local, independently-owned newspapers have left us, and I think this ownership of newspapers by people who actually live and operate outside of Wales is not necessarily a good thing.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see what happens now with The Pembrokeshire Herald. \n\n\"It's quite a crowded market place in Pembrokeshire, but good luck to them and I think it will give people more choice.\n\n\"There are people out there now who'll be looking at what happens in Pembrokeshire, looking at what happens in Caerphilly, to see, hang on a minute, there may be life in newspapers again,\"he added.\nTL;DR: In recent years there have been cuts to newspapers serving Wales. Dozens of staff have been laid off and some titles have closed prompting concern that local issues were not being reported on. But, as Sarah Moore reports, in a move bucking the trend, three local newspapers have recently been launched.\n\nArticle: On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we do experiments which sometimes throw up genuinely new science.

It happened to some senior officials in the past few years. Some musicians have had concerts targeted.\n\nFally Ipupa is the first Congolese artist to perform in Europe since then. It is a historic moment for Congolese music. Many people are saying that his concert will pave the way for others to perform. It is a challenge to members of the diaspora and they do not like it.\n\nFally Ipupa, who reportedly has a large following in France and has collaborated with several French rappers, was forced to cancel a concert in France in 2011, RTL reported.\n\nPolice said 30 people had been arrested and 54 people had been fined for participating in a banned protest.\nTL;DR: Police evacuated Paris's Gare de Lyon station after protesters started a fire to try to disrupt a concert by a Congolese singer.\n\nArticle: Steve Williams and Ian Rennie will leave the organisation after its annual conference next month.\n\nA damning report published in January said the federation should be changed from\"top to bottom\".\n\nIt said there was a\"worrying loss of confidence\"in the organisation, which represents ranks up to chief inspector.\n\nThe report was commissioned in the wake of the\"plebgate\"row, which began as a disagreement between Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell - then chief whip - and police officers guarding the gates at Downing Street.\n\nThree weeks after the incident, Mr Mitchell met three officers representing the Police Federation, who afterwards claimed Mr Mitchell had failed to give a full explanation of what had happened in Downing Street. They called for him to resign - which he later did.\n\nBut a recording of the meeting made secretly by Mr Mitchell showed he had apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he had used the word\"pleb\".\n\nMr Williams said:\"The Police Federation has faced a turbulent period in its history and there has been much criticism of our organisation and the way certain members behaved.\n\n\"When I took up office it was quite clear that as an organisation we were not fit for purpose and that is why I, along with my joint central committee colleagues, commissioned an independent review to help us identify our weaknesses and come up with solutions.\"\n\nHe said the review, led by former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Normington, showed the federation was\"not delivering what our members wanted\"- but he said the fact 91% of officers wanted change gave the leadership a\"clear mandate\".\n\n\"Over the last few months, despite at times some significant challenges and opposition along the way, I have tried to manoeuvre the organisation to a place whereby we can start to deliver what is best for the Police Federation, its members and the British police service as a whole,\"he said.\n\nHe said it was now\"right and proper\"that a new chairman should be elected to\"take this organisation into the next phase\".\n\n\"I have made no secret of my fears that unless we get this right and embrace the change required, others will do it to us,\"he added.\n\n'Amazed and surprised'\n\nHome Secretary Theresa May said she was\"sorry\"Mr Williams was retiring.\n\nShe said he\"understood\"the need for change in the federation and had been\"right\"to commission the Normington Review.\n\n\"If the federation is to have public legitimacy, the Normington recommendations now need to be implemented, in full and in good time,\"she said.\n\nMr Rennie, who has been general secretary since 2008, has not yet commented.\n\nA federation statement said:\"Ian has been the chief negotiator on police pay, terms and conditions for the last six years, leading negotiations on behalf of all police officers during an incredibly turbulent period in policing history.\"\n\nMP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said he was\"amazed and surprised\"by the retirements, which would\"leave this important organisation with a huge vacuum and leaderless at a time when they need strong direction\".\n\n\"It will remain to be seen if the federation will continue on the path of change,\"he said.\nTL;DR: The chairman and general secretary of the Police Federation of England and Wales have both announced their retirements after a \"turbulent\" period.\n\nArticle: The Department for Transport also wants to give councils more powers to tackle parking in cycling lanes. \n\nIt is proposing a series of 50 measures in a bid to reduce the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed. \n\nLast year, 100 cyclists died on UK roads and 470 pedestrians were killed, an increase of 5%.\n\nA new cycling and walking\"champion\"would be appointed by the government as part of the plans, to make sure the DfT's policies meet the needs of road users across the UK. \n\nLocal authorities will be encouraged to spend about 15% of their local transport infrastructure funding on walking and cycling.\n\nThe DfT also wants to create a new police unit to analyse evidence of dangerous driving that has been caught on camera by other road users.  \n\nThe\"back office unit\", as outlined in the two-year plan, would allow police forces to handle video and photographic evidence that has been captured on devices like dash cams. \n\nIt comes after a similar operation was tried out by North Wales Police in October 2016, leading to the force dealing with 129 cases by the following August as a result of submitted footage.\n\nA review of the Highway Code could also be carried out to consider its guidance about how drivers should behave in relation to vulnerable road users.\n\nAn alliance of walking and cycling organisations - Cycling UK, The Ramblers, British Cycling, Living Streets and Sustrans - said they were frustrated the overall strategy did not place more emphasis on speed reduction. \n\n'Helping save lives' \n\nCycling UK chief executive Paul Tuohy said:\"Lowering vehicle speeds around people walking, cycling and horse riding doesn't just reduce the danger to them, but also their perception of the danger.\n\n\"While the DfT's proposals for amendments to the Highway Code will help save lives, ignoring the threat and dangers of speeding is disappointing.\"\n\nCycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said:\"Greater road safety - and especially the protection of vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders - is essential.\n\n\"We want to improve air quality, encourage healthy exercise, reduce obesity and boost our high streets and economic productivity.  \n\n\"That means more support for cycling and walking, and that's what these new measures are designed to deliver.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers says\"We are unaware of this proposal. There have been no discussions between the ABI and the government on any proposals around motor insurance premiums and its bikeability scheme.\n\n\"Insurers support improved road safety, but in 2017 less than 0.1% of motor claims involved cyclists, so it is hard to see how this could have any meaningful impact on premiums.\"\nTL;DR: Motorists should be offered cheaper insurance if they take a course to make them more aware of cyclists on the roads, the government says.\n\nArticle: Those picked will have an all-inclusive getaway on the island of Rhodes at a cost of \u20ac399 (\u00a3344; $472) per person, but there are some catches.\n\nThey will not be allowed to leave the resort and will have to quarantine for up to 10 days when they return home.\n\nAt least 25,000 people have signed up for the government-backed experiment.\n\nThe Dutch government's travel advice otherwise is that all foreign trips should be avoided, unless essential, until at least the middle of May.\n\nWhile many people may like to swap a life of lockdown for a week of Greek sunshine, questions have been raised about whether enabling such escapism is responsible or reckless at a time when both the infection rate and hospital admissions in the Netherlands are on the rise, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports.\n\nThe Netherlands has recorded at least 16,536 deaths and 1,246,366 cases of infection during the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut with public pressure mounting to allow summer holidays to go ahead, experiments like this one could help to determine whether there is a Covid-secure way to allow people to take an overseas break during the pandemic, she adds.\n\nOver the weekend, a two-day trial music festival was held near Amsterdam.\n\nHow will the test holiday work?\n\nTour company Sunweb is offering 187 tickets for people aged 18-70, which will be awarded manually according to criteria set by the government.\n\nThey will be chosen by age group and people with high-risk conditions will be excluded, a Sunweb spokeswoman told BBC News. Final choices will be determined by who registered first. \n\nTravellers will be tested before and after their trip.

He knows that we have to learn from the West and make innovations. He  sees this, but whether he can change it is another matter.\n\n\"Another thing is the wealth gap mainly caused by corruption. We put our energy into creating a market economy, but the benefits we got from reform were basically taken by government officials.   \n\n\"All capital is transferred to the hands of government officials and rich people, regardless of environmental protection, social security, medical insurance, education, etc. So now the relationship between people and government officials is very tense,\"she also said.\n\n\"Because the party's leaders have profited so much from the market economy, the whole world sees how corrupt our government officials are and how angry our people are.

The makeshift bedding around the warmth of buildings seems more brutal and isolated as temperatures fall.\n\nBut the experience of the fledgling college suggests that homeless people want more than temporary support.\n\nSelf-confidence\n\nLaunched as an experiment in autumn 2012, the college was taken aback by the demand and found would-be students knocking on the door. At the start of the second term, there are now 395 people enrolled on 60 courses.\n\nThe most popular courses have proved to be about raising self-confidence and developing self-esteem, says Andy Williams, who helps to organise the college.\n\nThis reflects the corrosive quality of homelessness and how it isolates individuals.\n\nAs an indication of its importance, a student at the college has taken three bus journeys from north London to get there. Steve, now in his 50s, says how much of a difference it makes to\"have a bit of confidence\".\n\nDrifting out of school by the age of 12, his dyslexia not recognised at the time and\"seen as an illiterate\", he talks about his depression and drinking.\n\nNow he is making a belated re-entry into education. He speaks with enthusiasm for the project - and says the courses he is taking have to be better\"than sitting there with a can in my hand\".\n\nThere are other courses aimed at developing skills to help people get jobs.\n\nOnce a student has taken six of these free-form courses they can be considered for something more formal. The college has links with Ruskin College in Oxford and the City Lit in London.\n\nBut this isn't going to be a traditional academic ladder.\n\n\"The college provides a structured environment for people - but without some of the demands of mainstream education. It seems to be filling a gap,\"says Stuart Bakewell, St Mungo's area manager.\n\nStudent identity\n\nThe status of\"student\"is itself important for people who are used to other labels being attached to them. It's also seen as important that it's located in its own separate building.\n\nAnother college attender, David, in his 50s, talks about using college courses as a fresh start - and a way to build more successful relationships than in the past.\n\n\"It's a chance to find out what went wrong. We're all in the same boat, we have to sort this out.\n\n\"The Recovery College shows you can do it.\"\n\nBeing students is a sign of equality, he says. He also talks about the importance of the social aspects of learning for people who might otherwise spend many hours alone.\n\n\"Having a laugh in class\"is even more important among people who have vulnerable, dangerous, stress-filled lives.\n\nSuccess is measured in small steps. Even volunteering takes a level of confidence - and there are plans to help students from the college to become volunteer helpers in a London museum.\n\nHomelessness is often linked to other problems. People might have been through institutions and addictions. Many homeless people will be functionally illiterate.\n\n\"The vast majority didn't have a good time at school - so this is showing it can be enjoyable,\"says Mr Williams.\n\nThere is also a growing homeless population. According to St Mungo's, the number of rough sleepers in London is rising sharply - up by more than 40% in a year.\n\nGetting them out of the cold is a start.\"We want to be more ambitious for them,\"said Mr Williams.\nTL;DR: An innovative college for homeless people in London, the first of its kind in the country, is attracting hundreds of students.\n\nArticle: The world's top riders will compete in the opening weekend of the Games and Team GB has high hopes of medals.\n\nThe race route takes cyclists from The Mall, through west London and then out to Surrey and back. \n\nSprint cyclist Mark Cavendish said competing at a home Olympics would be a\"once in a lifetime opportunity\".\n\nThe race cuts through Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham to cross the River Thames at Putney Bridge.\n\nRiders will speed through Richmond Park, back across the Thames at Richmond Bridge before passing through Bushy Park, Hampton Court Palace and into Surrey.\n\nFrom Richmond the athletes head off on a large loop through Surrey taking in Walton on Thames, Weybridge, West Byfleet, West Horsley and Dorking.\n\nThis is where a 15.5km (9.6 miles) circuit around Box Hill, including the National Trust's Zig Zag Hill, kicks in, according to London 2012.\n\nThis loop is repeated several times to help make up the approximately 240km (149 miles) distance for the men's race and the 130km (80.78 miles) course for the women's competition.\n\nThe pack then heads back to London through Leatherhead, Esher, Hampton Court, Kingston and Richmond Park before using the same route back to The Mall.\n\nCavendish, who won his 15th Tour de France stage last year, is already looking forward to his Olympic challenge.\n\n\"Competing in a home Olympic Games is a once in a lifetime opportunity,\"he said.\n\n\"To compete in the road race on the opening day of the London 2012 Games in front of home fans is going to be amazing.\n\n\"I look forward to checking out the course in detail and to experiencing the well-known cycling terrain in Surrey through to the finish on The Mall.\"\n\nSurrey County Council's Denise Saliagopoulos said:\"The county council has been working closely with London 2012 organisers to bring the road races to Surrey for many months. \n\n\"The events will provide a huge boost to the economy and focus the eyes of the world on Surrey during the opening weekend of the Olympic Games.\"\n\nTerence Patrick, councillor responsible for the Olympics at Guildford Borough Council, said:\"We are very pleased to be part of these spectacular racing events during the opening weekend of the Olympic Games.

They're sitting 2m (6ft) apart,\"she said.\n\nTighter restrictions were brought in by the prime minister on Monday.\n\nUnlike weddings and baptisms, funerals have still been allowed to go ahead but with immediate family only.\n\n\"The job of a celebrant or minister is always challenging emotionally,\"Ms Brewer said.\n\n\"Conducting a funeral under restrictions is so much harder because you know the person that's passed away really deserved a packed house and a wake where everyone shares happy memories.\n\n\"I know how much a funeral means and how much it is a part of the grieving process to be able to share your grief with other people that loved your loved one. \n\n\"Not being able to do that is heartbreaking to watch.\"\n\nMs Brewer praised the people who were still enabling the process to take place.\n\n\"Starting with the nurses and doctors, moving on to coroners, registrars, funeral directors, mortuary staff - everybody is putting themselves at risk to look after other people's loved ones with dignity,\"she said.\n\n\"We put on a smile, do our job under really tricky circumstances because obviously people aren't enjoying these restrictions - understandably so. But we have no choice.\n\n\"I'd really like people to be kind to them. It's such a hard time for everybody but we all want to get back to normal.\"\n\nThe celebrant, who covers the Devon and Cornwall area, is warning people to stick to the rules or risk funerals being banned, as has happened in some other parts of the world.\n\n\"To not have a funeral is unthinkable,\"she said.\"I can't even begin to imagine how awful that would be for a family to not be able to say a proper goodbye.\n\n\"But if people flout the rules, it will push it to the next level of non-attended funerals which I cannot even begin to imagine how hard that would be.\"\nTL;DR: A celebrant said conducting funerals amid the coronavirus outbreak has been \"heartbreaking\" as restrictions have meant only 10 people could attend.\n\nArticle: John Goldup, the former deputy chief inspector and national director of social care, apologised for the organisation's failure. \n\nHe said:\"We did not get it right on child sexual exploitation in Rotherham... and I apologise for that.\"\n\nAbout 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013 a report found.\n\n'Raped and abused'\n\nAppearing before the Communities and Local Government Committee, Mr Goldup said:\"Inspection up to the latter part of 2012 did not have the focus on child sexual exploitation that it would have and should have had if we had known and understood then what we understand now.\n\n\"What Ofsted would and should have focussed on is, giving that it [sexual exploitation] is happening, how effectively is the local authority working to try and disrupt and interrupt it to protect the children that were being raped and abused.\"\n\nHe said it was not until events in late 2012, including the publication of a report in the Times newspaper highlighting the issue in Rotherham, that Ofsted fully understood the problem.\n\nHe said:\"Our understanding of child sexual exploitation was limited. We knew it happened, we knew it was wicked and hugely damaging to children but it was widely perceived as a localised issue.\"\n\nHowever, he said that it was when Ofsted first directly went in to do a social care inspection in Rotherham in 2009 that the authority was exposed as a failing authority.\n\n\"I think that does also say something about the strength and the robustness of Ofsted inspection then and subsequently, but I absolutely accept that we didn't have the focus on child sexual exploitation that we certainly would and should have now.\"\n\nMr Goldup told the committee that, until 2012, Ofsted operated under a framework which focused on the danger of child abuse within homes, rather than exploitation by adults outside the care setting.\n\n'Like a pitbull'\n\nCommittee member Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said Ofsted inspectors should have been aware of previous child exploitation scandals in places like Derby, where nine men were convicted of systematically grooming and sexually abusing teenage girls.\n\n\"You guys are paid to be on top of this subject,\"Mr Danczuk said.\n\n\"It's your profession to know that this type of abuse goes on, to think'It's happened in Derby, it could happen in other parts of the country, perhaps we should design a framework that tries to get to the detail of this'.\n\n\"But you took to 2012 to accept that the rape of children might be occurring outside the home. I don't get it.\"\n\nHe went on to claim that inspectors failed to react to social workers dismissing exploitation as a\"lifestyle choice\"of the teenage girls and boys in their care.\n\nHowever, Mr Goldup said:\"If they had encountered that attitude from a single social worker, they would have followed that up like a pitbull in the inspection.\"\n\nIn November, the Communities and Local Government Committee criticised Ofsted for\"failing to protect children in Rotherham\"and announced plans to call the watchdog in to face questions.\n\nLast month Debbie Jones, Ofsted's director of social care, appeared before the committee and admitted that its inspections of children's services in Rotherham was\"not good enough\".\n\nMs Jones said:\"We at Ofsted feel that what we have done is not good enough. Of course we're sorry - we're sorry along with, I'm sure, everybody else who has been in front of this committee.\"\n\nShe also acknowledged that past inspection frameworks had lacked focus.\nTL;DR: Ofsted inspectors lacked the focus to target child abuse in Rotherham because they had a \"limited\" understanding of it, an ex-watchdog director told MPs.\n\nArticle: The\"foulards rouges\"are demanding an end to the violence witnessed at yellow-vest (gilets jaunes) rallies.\n\nThe gilets jaunes movement grew out of fuel tax protests in November.\n\nIt now embraces wider discontent with President Emmanuel Macron and has seen some of the most serious street violence in Paris since 1968.\n\nBut the weeks of TV footage showing clashes with riot police and damage to public monuments have triggered a counter-movement. The red scarves now have about 21,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nMore than 10,000 people took part in Sunday's march, Le Figaro reported.\n\n\"People are tired of the roadblocks. They are bad for business, and children are prevented from getting to school on time,\"red scarves spokesman Alex Brun told French broadcaster RFI.\n\nAhead of Sunday's rally in Paris, the red scarves put out a joint statement with similar-minded groups.\n\n\"We denounce the insurrectional climate installed by the yellow vests. We also reject the threats and constant verbal abuse (aimed at non-yellow vests),\"they announced in a joint manifesto. \n\nHowever, according to French media, a split has already emerged among the red scarves over whether or not to show support for President Macron.\n\nOne of the organisers of Sunday's march, Laurent Souli\u00e9, has rallied supporters on Facebook to back the president, RFI reported.\n\nMr Brun, on the other hand, said the\"foulards rouges\"were\"an apolitical citizens' movement\". He said the best way to resolve problems caused by the yellow vests was to take part in Mr Macron's\"Grand Debate\"rather than confronting protesters on the street.\n\nSome red-scarf leaders had urged members not to attend Sunday's rally.\n\nThe Grand Debate involves town-hall meetings nationwide to address protesters' concerns.\n\nAcross France, about 69,000 people took part in the 11th consecutive weekend of yellow-vest protests the interior ministry said.

Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said expanding the Community Testing Programme to more people without symptoms was\"crucial given that around one in three people\"who contract Covid-19 show no symptoms. \n\nIt said regular community testing using the rapid tests had already identified more than 14,800 positive Covid-19 cases.\n\nSo far, 131 local authorities in England have enrolled in the government's community testing programme, with Milton Keynes, Slough, Doncaster and Essex the latest to join.\n\n'Worrying'\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said targeted asymptomatic testing and subsequent isolation was\"highly effective in breaking chains of transmission\".\n\nBut Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol Medical School, said increasing lateral flow testing was\"very worrying\"and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases\"will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests\".\n\nDefending lateral flow tests on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme Mr Hancock said mass asymptomatic testing in Liverpool had seen the case rate drop\"more sharply than it did in other similar areas where only restrictions were brought in\".\n\nNHS Test and Trace will also work closely with other government departments to scale up workforce testing, the Department of Health and Social Care said.\n\nMany are already piloting regular workforce testing, with 15 large employers having taken up this offer already across 64 sites,\"including organisations operating in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and within the public sector including job centres, transport networks and the military\".\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place for rapid testing of staff and students in schools and colleges and staff in primary schools.\n\nAsked when schools could reopen by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Hancock said there were four conditions: that there is not a major new variant, the vaccine rollout is proceeding effectively, the number of deaths is falling and there is an easing of pressure on the NHS.\n\nBusinesses have welcomed asymptomatic testing. \n\nMatthew Fell, of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 UK businesses, said:\"This expansion of testing will help more critical workers and those unable to work from home to operate safely, while also catching new cases more swiftly.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the safety of the workforce had been an\"absolute priority\"and said the expansion of testing means\"we can keep our economy on the move while giving individuals in key sectors complete confidence that their workplace is safe\". \n\nBut Prof Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London, told BBC Breakfast the country would continue a\"yo-yoing of lockdown\"without a\"test, trace and isolate system that actually works\"and warned there needed to be tighter restrictions and tougher messaging than in March to prevent\"tens of thousands of avoidable deaths in the next few weeks\". \n\nIn other developments:\nTL;DR: Regular rapid testing for people without coronavirus symptoms will be made available across England this week, the government has said.\n\nArticle: Along with his family, he was uprooted from Monmouth in south Wales to Germany, where his father Colonel Walter Brook, was tasked with helping re-build the devastated country post World War Two. \n\nYoung Kim, along with his older siblings, was told\"not to be friendly\"with the Germans, and that they were\"different\". \n\nBut, ignoring orders, he soon began having snowball fights and making friends. \n\nHis parents too, rebuked orders, refusing to requisition a house from a German family, and instead deciding to share it with them. \n\nThe family story was recorded by Kim's son, Rhidian Brook, in a novel The Aftermath, published in 2013.\n\nIt has now been released as a film, with actress Keira Knightley starring as Rachel, a character loosely inspired by Kim's late mother, Anthea. \n\n\"I am very proud of my son, Rhidian, for writing this story and recording our family history,\"said Kim, now 80 and living in Brecon.\n\n\"But I am also so proud of my parents.\n\n\"They had a Welsh heritage and they took this welcoming and generous spirit with them to Germany.\"\n\nMuch of the book and film focuses on the character of Kim's dad Walter - Lewis in the film. \n\nBorn in 1895, Walter grew up on a farm near Presteigne, Powys.\n\nHe was stationed in Egypt and Arabia during World War One, becoming friends with T.E Lawrence - Lawrence of Arabia - who impressed Walter with the way he managed to unite the Arabs. \n\nDuring World War Two, Walter was then tasked with contributing to the rebuilding of government in Germany once the war was over.\n\nKim said:\"I remember he sent home lots of letters and photos.\n\n\"I also saw pictures in weekly magazines of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, so I knew a bit of what to expect.\"\n\nStill, arriving in Hamburg - recently completely destroyed by a strategic bombing campaign by the Allies - was a shock.\n\n\"I recall meeting with dad, then being driven through miles of ruins,\"he said.\n\n\"There was literally nothing standing, and lots of the ruins had black crosses on them, marking the dead bodies. \n\n\"The desperation and starvation was in your face.\"\n\nAs the Allies were determined no former Nazis were going to be in positions of responsibility, Walter was installed as Governor to Pinneburg, a district just west of the city of Hamburg. \n\nHe was given use of a local mansion, but instead of ordering the German owners to leave, instead opted to share the property with businessman Wilhelm Ladiges, his wife Erika, daughter Heike, seven, and sons Theo, 12 and Holger, five.\n\nThe Ladiges had the first floor and the Brooks the ground floor, but both families shared a kitchen in the basement. \n\nKim recalls:\"We were told not to really talk to the Ladiges, even though they had been as anti-Hitler as anyone dared during the war.\n\n\"We were meant to display dignified curtness, but it was an extremely cold winter, so we wanted to have snowball fights.\n\n\"I soon learnt German and began to play with Heike in the countryside. We climbed trees and played hopscotch.\"\n\nHis ability to break down barriers earned him the nickname Der Eisbrecher or the ice-breaker.\n\nBut it wasn't just the children who formed relationships. \n\nKim said:\"During Christmas 1947, I remember us children dressing up in sheets and the two families singing Silent Night in German around the tree.\n\n\"Both sets of parents had tears rolling down their cheeks and, after that, the relationship moved on with greater warmth and understanding.\"\n\nOnce warmer weather arrived, the Brooks began taking Heike with them on their trips to the seaside. \n\nKim said:\"It wasn't allowed, so she had to hide in the car's footwell in case we bumped into military police.\n\n\"But she was treated as an equal, and this was important.

We climbed trees and played hopscotch.\"\n\nHis ability to break down barriers earned him the nickname Der Eisbrecher or the ice-breaker.\n\nBut it wasn't just the children who formed relationships. \n\nKim said:\"During Christmas 1947, I remember us children dressing up in sheets and the two families singing Silent Night in German around the tree.\n\n\"Both sets of parents had tears rolling down their cheeks and, after that, the relationship moved on with greater warmth and understanding.\"\n\nOnce warmer weather arrived, the Brooks began taking Heike with them on their trips to the seaside. \n\nKim said:\"It wasn't allowed, so she had to hide in the car's footwell in case we bumped into military police.\n\n\"But she was treated as an equal, and this was important.

It was trading up 3.6% as of midday BST.\n\nAnalysts said the second quarter numbers - and Nokia's decision to leave its full-year forecast unchanged - were largely in line with expectations.\n\n\"It's a bit of a mixed bag,\"said Richard Windsor, equity analyst at Nomura.\"The margin guidance for [the third quarter] is, I think, quite a lot worse than some people were looking

after failing to secure MPs support for his deal on Saturday, calls for a three-month extension.\n\nMr Kinnock, who has previously talked about backing a deal, said he did not support the government on Tuesday night because ministers had not gone far enough on protecting environmental standards, workers' rights and consumer protections.\n\nOn the length of any delay to Brexit he said:\"I don't

estimated\".\n\nBoris Johnson said the report proved that\"bold measures\"were needed.  \n\nThe researchers, believed to be the first to combine the two pollutants, found that in 2010 there was the equivalent of 5,900 deaths associated with NO2 long term exposure and 3,500 deaths as a result of long-term exposure to PM2.5.\n\nThe total amounted to 9,400 deaths, although it was noted those affected by PM2.5 had decreased from 4,300 in 2008. \n\nThe study also found that nearly half of those affected by air pollution had been the result of pollutants being brought into the city via diesel fumes or industrial emissions transported from the European continent.  \n\nMayor of London Mr Johnson said:\"I've been criticised for cleaning up taxis, upgrading bus fleets and my plans for

shown to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme - to the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said they would tell people not to seek advice from MPs who did not sign.\n\nIt asks him to raise the issue in the House of Commons\"at the earliest opportunity and request that party whips instruct their MPs to immediately cease the practice\".\n\n\"MPs have a responsibility to advocate for all their constituents, regardless of immigration status,\"the letter reads. \n\n\"Many migrants are now fearful of contacting their MP, effectively excluding them from democratic representation.\"\n\nLib Dem MP Tim Farron, who is also supporting the campaign, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme:\"It astonishes me that any MP would think that the best way to respond to a vulnerable constituent is to shop them to the Home Office. \n\n\"Many of those immigrants who may be here illegally will be victims of administrative error, dodgy solicitors or even human trafficking.\"\n\nAkram Salhab, who coordinated the campaign for the groups Migrants Organise and Global Justice Now, said that many MPs refusing to sign were confused about their duties.\n\n\"Some have said that they will not report people for immigration enforcement but may do if they have committed a crime. \n\n\"But these are separate issues - if someone has committed a serious crime, they should be reported to the police not the Home Office,\"he said.\n\nMr Salhab said he feared those reported would be caught up in the\"Home Office's unjust broken system\", citing the Windrush scandal, in which migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. \n\nPlaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, who recently raised the case of Bangor engineering student Shiromini Satkunarajah, one of his constituents, in the House of Commons - helping to stop her imminent deportation to Sri Lanka, said:\"I don't think that MPs should be reporting cases to the authorities.\n\n\"This would break the trust between MPs and their constituents.\n\n\"It would also discourage other vulnerable people from seeking help.\"\n\nA number of Conservative MPs who declined to sign the pledge, including Alberto Costa and Craig Whittaker, said in a statement that while\"sometimes devastating\"mistakes had been made by the Home Office, lessons were being learned. \n\n\"Like any member of the public, an MP may decide to contact the Home Office to report suspected immigration offences just as he or she would be expected by most constituents to report any suspected illegal activity, not least because that is an obligation we all have.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Leo Sands.\n\nWatch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK and on iPlayer afterwards.\nTL;DR: An immigration enforcement hotline was called 68 times by MPs or their staff last year, it has been revealed.\n\nArticle: Swimming the Thames from Lechdale, Gloucestershire to Westminster Bridge is a task few would want to take on, and David Walliams raised nearly \u00a31m for charity as he neared the finish line.\n\nBut just how difficult a feat was it for the Little Britain star - who, though not up to the standards of a professional athlete, is a strong swimmer who has previously successfully tackled the English Channel?\n\nFormer Commonwealth swimming gold medallist Sharron Davies says the distance Walliams tackled was not in itself remarkable, given that an Olympic contender in training might expect to swim some 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) twice a day.\n\nBut she adds:\"What makes it so hard is doing it in dirty water with low visibility and tides while swans are attacking you - it's a very impressive achievement.\"\n\nCertainly, Walliams' training regime in rivers for his Sport Relief Big Splash Challenge exposed him to the kind of obstacles that are rarely encountered in swimming pools.\n\n\"I was hit by rowing boat oars, attacked by swans and got covered in insect bites from all the bugs that live in the weeds. It was also very, very cold,\"he said before embarking on the charity swim. \n\nAdditionally, his progress was marred by the river's more feculent contents. According to Thames Water, some 500,000 cubic metres (17,660,000 cubic feet) of raw sewage entered the London section of the Thames in the week before Walliams reached it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the comedian suffered a bout of\"Thames tummy\"despite receiving several inoculations since he set off on on 5 September.\n\nThe final section of the course proved to be tough in the extreme, with increased boat traffic as well as strong currents and undertows as the river becomes tidal.\n\nWith Walliams burning an estimated 4,400 calories every day, the sheer physical demands were considerable - although Walliams, who crossed the 22-mile (35 km) English Channel in a respectable 10 hours and 34 minutes, was physically well-equipped for this task.\n\nHowever, according to Davies, it is the mental toughness required to keep going that is more difficult to achieve.\n\n\"It's the ability to just zone out and keep going that I find most impressive,\"she adds.\n\nOne swimmer who has experienced the hazards of the tidal Thames is Times columnist Matthew Parris, who in 2010 crossed the river from Rotherhithe to Limehouse by breast stroke wearing a singlet and a pair of swimming trunks.\n\nThough he is keen to point out that his hour-long expedition - for which he was criticised by the Port of London Authority - was nowhere near as onerous as that faced by Walliams, he says even such a short swim is much more difficult than an onlooker might imagine. \n\n\"When you stand above the river you think,'That's easy, I could get across,'\"Parris recalls.\"But when you're in the water it's a very different matter.\n\n\"It was much choppier than I expected it to be. He'll be finding that other shipping is a problem by now, as well.\"\n\nSewage, tides, river traffic and swans have not been the only obstacles Walliams has confronted. He also rescued a labrador named Vinny who jumped into the water alongside him.\nTL;DR: Comedian David Walliams has finished a 140-mile swim (225km) of the River Thames for charity. How tough a challenge is this?\n\nArticle: Ian Brown, 44, and Daniel Dunkley, 35, died following incidents in their cells at HMP Woodhill last July.\n\nTheir relatives claim Woodhill's governor has not complied fully with Prison Service Instructions (PSIs).\n\nBut the governor and the Secretary of State say the judicial review claim is\"neither appropriate or necessary\".\n\nPSIs cover management of prisoners at risk of harm to self, others and from others, early days in custody and medical emergency response codes.\n\nHeather Williams QC, for the families, said the claim addressed the\"exceptionally high\"rate of self-inflicted deaths at the Milton Keynes prison.\n\n'Serious breaches'\n\nThere were seven self-inflicted deaths last year, five in 2015 and 18 at the prison since May 2013.\n\n\"The rate of self-inflicted death at HMP Woodhill is far higher than at any other prison, at a time when the suicide rate in the prison estate as a whole is at a record high,\"said Ms Williams.\n\nShe said the case raised serious ongoing breaches of Article 2 of the Human Rights Act, which protects the right to life, and involved long-term failures to comply with the responsibility placed on the authorities to protect prisoners.\n\nJames Strachan QC said the governor was well aware of his obligations to comply with the requirements of the PSIs.\n\n\"The defendants do not dispute that the number of deaths at the prison is a legitimate matter of concern.\n\n\"However, not only have the governor and the Secretary of State taken significant action in 2016 to improve the situation, but as the taskforce approach shows, this is a continuing high priority.\"\n\nLord Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Garnham will give their decision at a later date.\nTL;DR: Families of two men who died in prison have brought a High Court case over the \"exceptionally\" high rate of self-inflicted deaths there.\n\nArticle: Extra bank holidays could lead to a drop in donations as most people give blood during the working week, said NHS Blood and Transplant.\n\nIt says hospitals will need about 2m pints (1.1m litres) of blood, plus an extra supply for Olympic visitors.\n\nIt called on the public to make blood donation a New Year's resolution.\n\nSupplies of donated blood are needed by the NHS for people having surgery or giving birth and those with conditions such as cancer and sickle cell disease.\n\nNHS Blood and Transplant said it was concerned the cluster of major events in 2012 could create a\"perfect storm\"and dramatically impact the number of blood donations coming in.\n\nAssistant director for blood donation, Jon Latham, said:\"Approximately two million units [470mls - just under a pint] of blood will be needed by hospitals throughout 2012, and the equivalent of 500 extra donations will be needed each week in the first six months to help us build blood stocks and cover extra potential need from Olympic visitors.\n\n\"We're calling on the public to make regular blood donation a New Year's resolution.  \n\n\"Whether you've never donated before or haven't done for a while, please book your appointment and help save lives in 2012.\"\n\nFigures show that in 2011 thousands fewer people donated blood due to a crop of bank holidays around Easter and the Royal Wedding.\n\nAnd in 2010, on the day of the football World Cup quarter final, and Andy Murray's Wimbledon semi-final, there was a 12% drop in donations compared with the previous year.\n\nIn 2012 there will be a cluster of events and bank holidays between April and August, including the Queen's Jubilee, Euro 2012, Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\nTL;DR: Blood stocks may be hit by 2012 events like the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee, according to the NHS body responsible for England and north Wales.\n\nArticle: By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nThe company behind the project - Miniwiz - is the brainchild of Arthur Huang, an architect and structural engineer. Increasingly shocked by the amount of consumer waste being dumped, he set out to explore alternatives.\n\n\"I knew that just hating waste won't make it go away,\"he says.\n\n\"There's already enough metal, enough plastic to support our economy many times over. There's a huge abundance of premium grade trash to use and re-use as base-source content for new products.\"\n\nMiniwiz sees waste as a valuable resource, not rubbish. Some 70 engineers and scientists in its Trash Lab - out of 80 staff in total - collect consumer and industrial garbage and process it for re-use.\n\nThe 13-year-old Taipei-based firm has created 1,200 new materials, many of which are being used in fabric, construction, consumer products and - perhaps most ambitious of all - the wings on a two-seater aircraft that Mr Huang intends to fly (once he's finished his pilot training).\n\n\"We will fly with a trash wing,\"he says proudly.\"We had to invent a new material. It's a carbon fibre-like material. It's taken two years' R&D (research and development), but we're almost there.\"\n\nMiniwiz has created a miniature wind turbine and solar panel from electronic waste and paper that can charge smartphones.\n\nAnd in 2010 it built a nine-floor 130-metre building from bricks made out of 1.5 million plastic bottles for a Taipei garden festival - fully tested for structural strength and with retardants against fire risk.\n\nCircular Economy\n\nThe BBC's Circular Economy series highlights the ways we are designing systems to reduce the waste modern society generates, by reusing and repurposing products.\n\nMr Huang admits not all the materials are fit for purpose (a small boat sank).\"But we must not be afraid to fail,\"he says, although he's had enough successes to win the 2015 Davos World Economic Forum's Technology Pioneer Award.\n\nTurning base metal into gold is only part of the challenge, however. Persuading manufacturers to use recycled material and convincing consumers they are fit for purpose has its own problems.\n\nSays Mr Huang:\"The most sophisticated textile plants and machine manufacturers will not use recycled materials, because it requires investment and they don't see a market. Manufacturing processes are optimised for linear supply chains. It's a chicken and egg situation.\"\n\nMiniwiz is trying to create a silk-like material out of plastic.\"We feel like we're getting close, but take-up is still very slow. \n\n\"If someone wants a silk shirt, they want a certain feel and quality, a certain weight. When a designer looks at our stuff, they say:'Great concept, great idea, but it's just not up there.'\"\n\nUndeterred, Miniwiz is turning the House of Trash into a community office and display centre which he hopes will become a hub for working with recycled materials.\"We want to work with the new generation of creatives and designers,\"he says. \n\nHe does, however, already work with big names: Nike, Coca-Cola, Marriott hotels and Starbucks.\n\nAt Marriott, Miniwiz is trying to develop a pillow that matches the hotel chain's existing products. At Nike, it's working on recycled sneakers. \n\nSays Mr Huang:\"I get to play with their data. At Nike I get to know the specification of a fine knit shoe. How strong is the yarn? What is the weather-proofing?\n\n\"We want to create recycled materials that compete with existing performance.\"\n\nTom Szaky, founder of US-based TerraCycle, is a huge admirer of Miniwiz.\"They're doing amazing things,\"he says.  \n\nNew Jersey-based TerraCycle specialises in the recovery of ocean plastic and works with major companies on recycled packaging. It has a crisp packet recycling operation with Walkers in the UK, and a scheme in Mexico for re-using chewing gum in packaging.\n\n\"Everything in the world can be recycled,\"says Mr Szaky. His firm is establishing a diagnostic division, where such diverse products as children's nappies and toothbrushes are not just recycled, but tested for health purposes. \n\n\"It's about showing what the future of recycling could mean,\"he says.\n\nFor such companies, recycling is about proving the possible. Take Miniwiz's Trashpresso machine, a mobile solar-powered rubbish composter about the size of a shipping container.\n\nIt shreds, cleans, heats and reformulates rubbish - mostly plastic - into tiles that can be used as building material or for injection moulding.\n\nThe initial idea came from Jackie Chan, who featured Mr Huang in his Green Heroes documentary. Fed up with the amount of waste left on film sets, Mr Chan began wondering if a portable recycler was feasible.\n\nTo demonstrate its potential two machines were hauled to a Tibetan village where locals had complained about tourist rubbish clogging the water system.\n\nDespite such inventions, a truly circular economy remains far off due to the costs of collecting and processing trash, says Mr Szaky.\"The value of garbage is far below the cost of recycling it.\"\n\nGovernments could address this market imbalance through tougher legislation, but Mr Huang also wants countries to commit a percentage of their procurement budgets to recycled products. \n\n\"It would open the floodgates for all sorts of technological innovation,\"he says. \n\nFor Mr Szaky, it is consumers who have the real power.\"When consumers make the right choices, producers and retailers will follow.\"\n\nFirms like TerraCycle are not without critics, however. Some say they legitimise single-use materials by offering hope that everything can - or will - be recycled. \n\nSays Mr Szaky:\"I understand the argument.

A ninth is in the works.\n\nTourists flock here to Islay to sample a peaty dram, to watch the birdlife, to breathe the briny air.\n\nIt looks idyllic - and prosperous - but this is also a land of sorrow and decay.\n\nClouds gathering\n\nOn a dusty track just outside the island's main settlement, Bowmore, Alasdair and Rachel Whyte are standing at a metal gate.\n\nIt affords a view of the bay and the hills beyond but their eyes are on the fields in the foreground.\n\n\"The sun may be shining but there is a cloud over Islay,\"says Mrs Whyte, in a lyrical island lilt.\n\nThese fields, she explains, were in her husband's family for more than a century, passed down through five generations of Whytes.\n\nThey did not own the land but were tenant farmers, part of a feudal system which survives to this day. \n\nThree years ago the land here was taken off the Whyte family when Mr Whyte's sister Aileen died suddenly at the age of 47, unmarried, childless and without a will.\n\nThe tenancy of the 100 acres was in her name and the law did not regard her brother as a close relative.\n\nOn that, Rachel Whyte is scathing:\"Who could ever say to somebody that you're not a close enough relative to your sister? That ends all stories.\"\n\nNotice of eviction\n\nThe Whytes say they were initially told they could keep farming the land but one day later a notice of eviction arrived by post from a legal firm in Edinburgh.\n\nThe landowner, or laird, could have made an exception but chose not to do so.\n\n\"I was totally shocked and stunned,\"says Mr Whyte,\"totally heartbroken.\"\n\nThe letter explained that the Whytes had no claim on the land and that the estate wanted it\"in-hand\"to\"complement our future plans\".\n\nThose plans turned out to be the building of scores of new houses.\n\n\"They are taking good agricultural land \u2026and putting people who were making a living off the land, they are putting them out,\"says Mr Whyte.\n\nHis wife claims that this is a deliberate policy to drive farmers off the fields, out of the glens and into new properties in Bowmore, a claim denied by the laird.\n\nNew housing\n\nLord Margadale of Islay Estates, who owns around a third of the island, insists he followed the law and says Mr Whyte was not a suitable tenant who\"didn't have a great track record with animal welfare\", a claim to which the Whytes object.\n\nThe laird insists that the new housing is vital for the island, that he is investing in Islay's future and that the feudal system can be defended.\n\n\"There's always room for landlords and tenants,\"he says,\"it works pretty well elsewhere in the UK.\"\n\n\"For people to get into farming the tenant system is the best way forward because with limited capital they're not going to be able to go and buy a farm.\"\n\nIn any case, insists Lord Margadale, the\"pendulum has swung\"in favour of tenants, following a first bite at change in the Land Reform Act 2003. \n\nCrofters, he points out, already have a right to buy their land and overall\"tenants have a lot more power, which is probably healthy\".\n\nMrs Whyte disagrees and sticks by her claim that the island is changing for the worse.\n\n\"We have had rural communities,\"she says,\"little pockets and it's kept shops going, little businesses going, the individual schools going.\n\n\"Now what you're doing is we're having another highland clearance. It's another highland clearance.\n\n\"Keep them down. Keep them all together. Get them in a group. Herd them up.\"\n\nClearances\n\nAll of this is rather familiar. A short drive through Bowmore and around the head of the sea-loch, the Bell family are reflecting on the 18th and 19th century highland clearances, the forced and sometimes brutal displacement of tenant farmers across the Scottish highlands and islands to clear land for sheep.\n\nMany ended up in planned towns as the glens were emptied. Gaelic culture and clan society were devastated.\n\nThousands more set out across the Atlantic to seek a new life, including Bruce Bell's ancestors, who headed west to the Canadian province of Manitoba.\n\n\"They were all tenant farmers and they were not doing very well at the time,\"explains Mr Bell who is back in Islay from Canada on holiday.\n\n\"Canadian Pacific Railway was putting on a major push where they were basically giving you free tickets and free land.\n\n\"The whole family, not just my grandfather, his father and all the brothers and sisters all came over as one big unit,\"he says.\n\nTony Rozga, a land reform campaigner on Islay who did manage to buy his family farm from Islay Estates, agrees that there are parallels with the present day.\n\nHe takes us for a drive to a spot where you can see three or four derelict houses from the main road.\n\n\"This is an example of a typical house that's not been lived in for a long time and could be sold off and developed by local people,\"says Mr Rozga, pointing to a dilapidated schoolhouse.\n\n\"There's other farmhouses like this dotted all over the island which used to be family farms with families in them,\"he adds.\n\n\"We would like to put forward a land reform case where you could persuade large estates to maybe sell off a bit of land, sell off houses, sell off farms, sell off bits so as the people who are here and making a living from the land can then do the investment that's required.\"\n\nInstead, he argues, tenant farmers are leaving their rented plots for the town or the mainland, reluctant to invest in land they do not own, especially if investment ends up increasing the value of the land and the rent going up.\n\n'Powerful lobby'\n\nA fellow campaigner, Catriona Bell (whose forbears stayed to till the land rather than heading to Canada) worries that the Land Reform Act will not be radical enough for her taste.\n\nScottish government ministers have promised to end tax relief for shooting estates, to establish a registry of privately-owned land and to force the sale of land if the owners are blocking development but Mrs Bell still frets that the legislation will not have teeth.\n\n\"The Scottish government will be taking on a very powerful lobby and really landowning essentially is power and it's power to decide a lot of things, not just tenancies,\"she says.\n\n\"It's power to decide where houses will be built, where almost any infrastructure will happen, so diminishing that power is going to be something that is going to be very difficult.\"\n\nAcross the water, part of the neighbouring island of Jura is owned by Lord Astor, whose step-daughter Samantha Cameron is married to the prime minister David Cameron. The family are frequent visitors.\n\nLord Astor caused a stir recently with an article in the Spectator asking whether landowners should fear a\"Mugabe-style land grab\", a reference to the seizure of farms by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.\n\nLord Astor says he stands by the comments. He is highly critical of the Scottish government's approach.\n\n\"If you are going to empower local communities you've got to make sure it's the local communities who will benefit,\"he says, arguing that the present system brings great benefits to the highlands and islands.\n\nAnd he worries about nationalist motives asking,\"is there going to be an implication if you're not Scottish you can't own land in Scotland?\"\n\n\"That brings into question'who are the Scots?'\"\n\nPloughing back\n\nLord Margadale agrees with Lord Astor that the status quo is good for tenants and owners alike.\n\n\"We've been here for 160 years,\"says Lord Margadale,\"we care about it, we're not milking it.\n\n\"We ourselves have never taken a bean out of the place,\"he insists.\n\n\"We've always ploughed everything back in \u2026it's all spent on the island.\"\n\nBut speaking before the bill's publication, rural affairs secretary Richard Lochhead, defends the Scottish government's approach.\n\n\"This is not about land grabs,\"he insists,\"this is about sorting out those areas where quite clearly economic development in this country, which is after all in the public interest, is being hampered by who owns the land and how it's managed.\"\n\nMinisters, he argues\"should have the tools to intervene\"on behalf of the people of Scotland to\"make sure that communities are able to have much more say over their own destinies, their own futures.\"\n\nHere on Islay and across Scotland, the centuries-old question of whether the land should be used for private gain or for the common good - or whether both are possible - remains controversial.\n\nAnd with the publication of the latest attempt to wrangle with it we are approaching a new battle on very old ground.\nTL;DR: Tracts of private land could end up in community control under radical plans to shake up land ownership in Scotland. Islay - off the west coast of Scotland - is home to 3,000 people but most of the island is owned by just a few wealthy men, highlighting a fault line in the rural life.\n\nArticle: The whale vomited five bags during a vain attempt by conservation officials to save it in a canal in Songkhla province.\n\nThe bags, weighing about 8kg (17lbs), had made it impossible for the whale to eat food, a marine expert said.\n\nA recent report warned the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter was curbed.\n\nThailand is a major user of plastic bags and its government last month announced it was considering a levy on them.\n\nThey are believed to kill hundreds of marine animals there each year.\n\nThe small male pilot whale had been discovered ailing and unable to swim in the Na Thap Canal last Monday.\n\nEnvironmental officials used boats to try to help float the whale and erected a sunshade for it.

His spate of deadly shootings, carried out in the name of al-Qaeda, was the first such jihadist attack in France since 1995.\n\nThe high-profile trial, which has been held amid tight security, began last month. Prosecutors had asked for life imprisonment for Abdelkader Merah and 20 years for Fettah Malki.\n\nAbdelkader Merah, 35, had been accused of mentoring and encouraging his brother's interest in jihadism, and of helping him to steal a scooter that was used in the attack. \n\nHe denied the allegations, and his lawyers argued that he was being pursued by prosecutors because they could not put Mohammad Merah on trial.\n\nFettah Malki was jailed for providing Mohamed Merah with a weapon, ammunition and a bullet-proof vest.\n\nMohamed Merah shot and killed Imad Ibn-Ziaten, a 30-year-old staff sergeant in the 1st Airborne Transportation Regiment, behind the Chateau de l'Hers school in a quiet district of Toulouse on 11 March 2012.\n\nFour days later, he killed two members of the 17th Airborne Combat Engineering Regiment, Corporal Abel Chennouf, 24, and Private Mohamed Legouad, 26, outside a small shopping centre in Montauban, 45km (30 miles) from Toulouse.\n\nOn 19 March, Merah attacked the Ozar Hatorah Jewish school in Toulouse. He murdered Jonathan Sandler, a 30-year-old rabbi and teacher of religion, and his two sons Arieh and Gabriel, aged five and four.\n\nThe fourth victim was the head teacher's daughter, seven-year-old Myriam Monsonego, whom Merah grabbed by the hair and shot in the head.\n\nMerah had filmed his murders with a head-mounted camera, which investigators later seized with the recording.\n\nHe was shot dead on 22 March after a police siege at his flat in Toulouse which lasted nearly a day and a half.\nTL;DR: The brother of the French jihadist who murdered seven people in Toulouse, including three Jewish children, has been jailed for 20 years.\n\nArticle: A report has revealed the issues in council properties built by the private sector.\n\nIt also provides details of the scale of construction flaws found at the DG One leisure centre.\n\nCouncil leader Elaine Murray said she had called a special meeting to provide details of the safety issues.\n\nA council statement said that after events such as a wall collapse at a school in Edinburgh and the Grenfell Tower fire public safety had been prioritised across the country.\n\n'Beyond comprehension'\n\nIt said that had required it to check all public buildings built during a certain time and review their condition.  \n\nThe report outlines the actions that the council is undertaking to ensure the safety of its buildings and the safety of the public. \n\nMs Murray said:\"We need to be open and transparent about the state of our buildings. \n\n\"Like everyone else will be, I am shocked at the details relating to the condition of DG One.\"\n\nShe said it was\"beyond comprehension\"that a building that was so\"fundamentally flawed\"would be handed over to the council by a contractor.\n\nThe \u00a317m leisure centre opened in 2008 but a string of problems led to its complete closure in 2014.\n\nA long-running legal wrangle meant it took nearly two years before the council reached a settlement with contractors to allow a \u00a310m repairs programme to begin.\n\nHowever, the latest report suggests that extra works running to millions of pounds will be required.\n\nProblems have also been found at Dumfries Ice Bowl and checks are being carried out at the Ryan Centre in Stranraer.\n\nA review of schools built under a public private partnership deal in the region has not found any concerns over wall ties.\n\nChecks are planned on all other council buildings.\n\n'Completely unacceptable'\n\nDepute council leader Rob Davidson said the extent and nature of the problems at DG One was\"staggering\".\n\nHe said the level of defects and required works were\"unprecedented\".\n\n\"I consider any instances of non-compliance with building regulations completely unacceptable, in particular those in high risk area such as structural safety and fire protection,\"he said.\n\n\"It is vital that everything is being done to deliver safe outcomes for the people who use or occupy our buildings.\"\n\nThe council is now being asked to commission an independent review into the DG One building and its construction so that\"all lessons are learned\".\n\nA report to be considered in private will also look at all options for the future of the leisure centre which is currently about halfway through its repairs programme.\n\nA spokesperson for Kier, who built the leisure centre, said:\"A settlement for DG One has already been reached, enabling full remedial works to be undertaken, after a successful independent mediation was completed in 2016.\"\nTL;DR:",

The scale of detailed prescription on programme content for science in particular runs the risk of hindering creative delivery.\"\n\nNeil Carberry, the CBI's director of employment and skills, said:\"Business demand for science, maths and technology skills has long outstripped supply. It risks squeezing out space for practical, hands-on experiments, which are vital to help children develop an interest in science from the start of school.  \n\n\"The proposed design and technology curriculum is out of step with the needs of a modern economy. It lacks academic and technical rigour, as well as clear links to the realities of the workplace.\"\n\nMr Carberry said that the CBI supported the government's move to make maths more demanding, as well as plans for the majority of pupils to carry on with maths up to the age of 18.\n\nBut he called on the government to\"send out a powerful signal\"by extending the maths curriculum beyond GCSE examinations.\n\n'Expertise and creativity'\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said:\"The new national curriculum is far less prescriptive and in fact is almost half the size of the current curriculum - 242 pages down from 468.\n\n\"There is just as much importance placed on practical work in the new science curriculum as the current version, and in fact there will be more opportunities for children in primary schools to undertake practical experiments.\n\n\"We trust teachers to use their expertise and creativity to shape the curriculum to the needs of their pupils.

(Especially if you want to harness the power of the newish, as it was back in 1999, internet to create the world's biggest online retailer in a country that controls the internet.)\n\nThe Chinese call it Guan Xi. It means connections.\n\nAlong the way Jack Ma helped create a behemoth that is a marvel. An example of China's economic prowess and innovation. But his company Alibaba has also agreed to share information about its customers if the authorities come calling; following the\"Chinese rules and laws\"he was telling me about last year.\n\nIt might be that Ma Yun, to use his proper Chinese name, joined because he believes that the China model works. The one that's made his country into an economic powerhouse, whilst ensuring the 100 or so mammoth state-run entities remained central to government control of the economy and the ruling CPC stayed in power.\n\nIt's probably a little late to pose this final question, because Jack Ma is due to step down from his role as executive chairman at Alibaba next year, but nonetheless the revelation of his party membership raises this intriguing point; CPC members are expected, in fact demanded, to give primacy to the Party over anything else.\n\nAlibaba has denied that its superstar boss ever put the CPC above the company - or indeed its NYSE-listed shareholders - when it came to big decisions. It's likely a moot point now, but others have noted that Jack Ma's CPC affiliation wasn't mentioned in Alibaba's share flotation brochure in 2014.\nTL;DR: Does being a founder and executive chairman of a company worth about $400bn (\u00a3313bn), with a personal wealth said to be about $35bn, put you at odds with being a member of a communist party whose leader wants to \"develop China, develop socialism and develop Marxism\"?\n\nArticle: There was an\"astonishing lack of economic planning for a pandemic\"which led to\"hastily drawn up economic support schemes\", the Commons Public Accounts Committee said.\n\nThat meant\"unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers,\"it added.\n\nBut the government said the schemes\"had provided a lifeline to millions\".\n\n\"We make no apology for the speed at which they were delivered,\"a spokesman said, adding that the government had rejected\"thousands of fraudulent claims\".\"Without them lives would have been ruined.\"\n\nSince the spring, the government has approved billions in spending and tax cuts to cushion the economy from the effects of the pandemic, including discounts to encourage dining out and income support for furloughed workers. \n\nThe furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of October, was designed to pay 80% of the wages of employees at firms hit by the pandemic. \n\nAccording to the latest figures, it sent \u00a339.3bn to 1.2 million employers to the 20 September.\n\nBut a recent estimate by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) suggested that up to 10% of the money delivered by the scheme to mid-August - \u00a33.5bn - may have been paid out in fraud or error.\n\nThe Commons Public Accounts Committee, which reviews government expenditure, described the figure as\"very worrying\".\n\nThe government should have been better prepared for the economic fall-out from the coronavirus outbreak, as a pandemic had been top of the national risk register for years, Committee chair Meg Hillier said \n\n\"Our finding of the astonishing lack of economic planning for a pandemic shows how the unacceptable room for fraud against taxpayers was allowed into the government's hastily drawn up economic support schemes,\"she said.\n\n\"I would like to see the government publish a list of the companies which received furlough money. Where taxpayers money is being used, transparency should be a given.\"\n\nThe committee also said when the outbreak occurred, HMRC switched staff from frontline tax collection activities to guiding taxpayers through the various Covid support schemes. But that has hurt the government's ability to collect revenue.\n\nHMRC has estimated the revenue it collected through its compliance work in the first three months of the tax year 2020-21 was down 51% on the same period the previous year, and warned the sums may never be recovered.\n\nThe committee said HMRC had administered the tax system based on the assumption that that the\"vast majority\"of taxpayers would be able to meet their obligations and that only a\"few exceptions\"would need to be pursued for non-compliance.\n\nIt said HMRC recently started issuing penalties for people not filing tax returns, because there has been a drop in the numbers being filed.\nTL;DR: Rushed-through coronavirus aid may have led to the loss of billions of pounds of taxpayers' money through fraud and error, MPs have warned.\n\nArticle: The comedian's wife Pamela Stephenson shared an image on social media of the 78-year-old wearing a mask with a plaster on his left arm.\n\nAlongside the picture, Ms Stephenson wrote:\"Thank God...

That is why we need to continue our efforts to ensure that we maintain a high rate of breastfeeding in the UK.\n\n\"The UK needs to see breastfeeding as a normal process, and to move away from some of the outdated and negative stigma that is depressingly still attached to it, specifically breastfeeding in public.\"\nTL;DR: Exclusive breastfeeding for six months wards off baby infections, further evidence suggests.\n\nArticle: By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent\n\nOur Valleys, Our Future was unveiled by the Welsh Government a year ago, with the aim of creating 7,000 new jobs.\n\nBut the Bevan Foundation said it was\"more of the same\".\n\nOne ex-miner said the valleys were facing a\"crunch\"time, with young people having to move away to find work.\n\nMinisters said reversing decades of decline could not be achieved in months and they were\"taking it seriously\"\n\nThe action plan to revitalise the valleys included a promise of thousands of jobs and work to improve public services, health, wellbeing and tourism.\n\nBut the Merthyr Tydfil-based Bevan Foundation said recent investment in Taffs Well and Nantgarw was not in core valley areas.\n\nDr Victoria Winckler, its director, said: \"It's a matter of scale.\n\n\"The target to get 7,000 into work sounds really impressive but if you look a bit deeper, that's not very ambitious at all, it's around about the numbers achieved over the last few years and if we carry on doing more of the same, the valleys won't change.\"\n\nDr Winkler said unemployment was 25% of young males in some areas and there had been job losses in retail and small factories.\n\nAnd she said she was\"puzzled\"how the Welsh Government could live with deprivation virtually on its doorstep without sufficient proposals to push investment and skills.\n\nBut Local Government and Public Services Secretary Alun Davies said they were concentrating on projects which would make a difference and wanted a\"greater tempo\"of investment. \n\n\"I share your impatience - but what I want to do is get this right and so that in the future we look back on decisions well taken which had the greatest possible impact,\"he said.\n\n'With the right help, it can grow'\n\nDione Conaty, 22, has a law degree from Swansea University, but is back in Maesteg and knows she will have to move if she wants to specialise in human rights law.\n\n\"Maesteg doesn't have a lot of variety especially if you've got a degree in something specific like law or business,\"she said. \n\nShe is currently working part-time in a coffee shop.\n\n\"Sometimes it's a bit harder because you want to get the money and you want to pay off your debt and you have to go further on to get that bigger salary.\"\n\nJohn Gates is a former miner who is now leading community project Maesteg Shedquarters, to encourage men to do practical work - from woodwork to music instrument-making. \n\nAt it height, 6,000 miners worked in the valley. Maesteg in Bridgend county now has above average unemployment, while nearly 40% have no qualifications.\n\nMr Gates stopped working underground in the mid 1970s after nearly 20 years. He moved into training until the pits closed and has only worked part-time since the 1990s. He said losing a job can be like a bereavement.\n\n\"When a man's in work he has a position, he has status, he has authority,\"he said.\n\n\"When he's made redundant, all that goes. He becomes his wife's helper. I've known many occasions when wives have said men are under their feet.\n\n\"It's particularly hard in the valleys. It's harder hitting. When the heavy industry went, the purpose for the valleys went. Everyone went into that depression. I think that's turning round, the only way is up.\n\n\"When the pits were here, we had five different mining institutes in the valley - with games rooms for billiards and darts but also a library for self- education. We've become those miner's institutes if you like. \n\n\"Those of us who are left realise we have to help ourselves. The community is building itself up for the ground but what we need is help. With the right help it can grow. What we don't want is people parachuting themselves in telling us what to do.\n\n\"There are no big employers. But each pit would have between 300 to 1,000 men and we were the border for the Margam steelworks. In the Llynfi valley in my lifetime there were three collieries. \n\n\"When I left school at 15, I went to the pit - nobody asked me - it was a smooth transition. My grandchildren are leaving education at 20 to look for a job. Now we've come to a crunch - there are loads of 20-year-olds with degrees and no work in the area and they have to move. And if they stay here they have to travel. \n\n\"The hopes of finding a big employer are draining away. Maesteg town centre is just a shadow of what it used to be and everyone blames the internet - but it might be the internet could be the saviour of the valley, if you can just put your goods online and sell it from home.\"\n\nEnterprise zone for whole valleys urged\n\nCommunities First areas'in limbo'\n\n'Bleak' vision for 2020 in Wales\n\nWhat has happened so far?\n\nSeven\"strategic hubs\"were unveiled to focus public money and attract private sector investment.\n\nIn a progress report, the Welsh Government said 1,000 people have been helped into work in the last 12 months and an additional 100 new enterprises have been created in the taskforce area.\n\nTransport for Wales is to be based in Pontypridd  and the Department for Work and Pensions is setting up a new headquarters in Nantgarw, with staff moving from Cardiff, Newport, Cwmbran, Merthyr and Caerphilly in 2021. \n\nAn industrial clothing factory is opening in Ebbw Vale and a train depot is to open in Taffs Well. \n\nMr Davies is hopeful of more job announcements soon.\n\nHe said it was now time for investment in individual projects to begin and it was a\"serious effort to deliver a comprehensive investment programme\". \n\nMr Davies, who represents the valleys constituency of Blaenau Gwent, said people were not looking for quick fixes but\"a serious programme\"to address issues.\n\nThey also wanted a better quality of life: Access to public transport, support for learning and issues like fly-tipping tackled.\n\nBut he said the 7,000 jobs target was\"realistic\"at a time of great economic pressures, and there was a vision beyond it.\nTL;DR: A landmark programme to improve the south Wales valleys is \"bland\" and not reaching those who most need it, a social policy think-tank has said.\n\nArticle: Police in Aralaganwila, near Welikanda, said two others were injured in the pre- dawn attack on a camp in Soriwila.\n\nPolice added that about 20 Karuna loyalists were residing in five camps in the jungle hideout.\n\nJournalist Raj Weerasinghe who visited the scene in Pudueli  Allai said the injured and the bodies have now been taken to Polonnaruwa hospital. \n\nDeceased identified\n\nThe deceased are identified as Devadas Devendran, James Kandasamy, Wijayan, Ravi and Devendran.\n\nThe injured, Kanapathipillai Yogarah and Sinnathambi Mahendran refused to speak to journalists, Raj Weerasinghe told BBC Sandeshaya (Sinhala service).\n\nPollonnaruwa additional magistrate Chandanie Meegoda ordered the police to conduct investigations.\n\nGiving evidence before the magistrate three survivors described the attack occurred around 2000-2100 GMT (0100-0200 SLT) on Thursday night.\n\nSurvivors\n\n\n\nAttackers raided the camps and started shooting indiscriminately, the survivors said.\n\nSurvivors said they couldn\u2019t identify the attackers.\n\nTamil Tigers, for their part, have denied any involvement in the attack.\n\nA spokesman for LTTE\u2019s Batticaloa- Ampara political wing said the attack may have been a result of a dispute between ENDLF and the Karuna faction.\n\n'Government responsible'\n\nThe government should be responsible for the attack as it happened in the government-controlled area, LTTE spokesman added.\n\nThere has been tension in eastern Sri Lanka since former Batticaloa-Ampara senior leader Karuna defected from the LTTE with thousands of cadres in March 2004.\n\n\n\nKaruna, former military strategist and a close ally of LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, went into hiding after Wanni Tigers crushed the rebellion within weeks in April 2004.\n\nLTTE  since then constantly accused Sri Lanka security forces of helping renegade rebels, a charge that military officials deny.\n\nTension intensified in Welikanda area after Tigers were accused of attacking another hideout of Karuna loyalists in March 2005. \n\nThey were also accused of killing eight Karuna loyalists in an attack to a Colombo safehouse in July.\n\nThe LTTE admitted killing Karuna\u2019s brother Reggie and was accused of killing many Karuna supporters since then.\nTL;DR: Sri Lanka\u2019s  Tamil Tiger rebels have killed five members of renegade rebel leader Karuna faction, police said.\n\nArticle: The airport said all flights were suspended following an electrical power supply failure at about 08:30 GMT on Saturday.\n\nFive outgoing flights were transferred to Manchester and Birmingham while other passengers waited in the departure lounge.\n\nThe power has since been restored.\n\nFlights from the airport resumed shortly before 16:00 GMT.\n\nHoward Ebison, head of customer services, said:\"Our main power supply failed and then we had a challenge with our back-up generator, which meant for a period of time we had no power at the airport.\"\n\nHe said:\"All our records show that our generators are spot-on in terms of the checks they have had, but when they are put under stress for a period of time that's when you find out there may be an issue -

Even more astonishing is that the UK Government considers another flu pandemic so dangerous to our society that it tops the list of the newly updated National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies. \n\nSo it\u2019s particularly timely that the BBC has just launched the BBC Pandemic App on the iOS App Store and Google Play. \n\nThis free app is part of the biggest experiment of its kind, a citizen science experiment that aims to spread a virtual pandemic - an outbreak of a simulated infectious disease around the entire country. \n\nThat may sound like an odd thing to want to do but, if successful, the BBC Pandemic could help save lives when \u2013 not if \u2013 the next lethal pandemic spreads across the world. \n\nWith international air travel at over four billion flights last year alone, stopping a flu pandemic taking hold is pretty much impossible nowadays, but the BBC Pandemic App will help a team of mathematical epidemiologists from the University of Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predict how a virus could spread across the UK and, crucially, test what might be done to slow it down. \n\nThe problem with pandemic flu viruses is that they emerge unannounced, unlike the seasonal flu we experience every winter.\n\nSeasonal flu can be deadly too and the warning signs from Australia show that this year could be a bad one, but at least we get a heads-up from our southern neighbours several months in advance. \n\nThis gives the critical time necessary to get a vaccine tailor-made and manufactured in sufficient volume to vaccinate key workers and those most vulnerable. \n\nBut, every now and again, the animal world creates a strain of the flu virus that humans have never seen before - we have little protection from our immune system, or enough time to make a vaccine before the virus has started to spread. \n\nThe 2009 pandemic was commonly known as swine flu because the human virus contained genes from a pig flu virus. The devastating Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by a virus that seems to have emerged from birds. \n\nPlanning for another pandemic is the best defence we have until vaccine technology manages to catch up. And that\u2019s where everyone in the UK can help, by downloading the BBC Pandemic App. \n\nOnce downloaded, users will be asked basic questions like age and employment status. \n\nThen the app will track users\u2019 approximate position every hour for just 24 hours - but the GPS will only be within the nearest square kilometre. Privacy as well as data protection is taken very seriously by the team. \n\nAt the end of the 24 hours, there are a few questions about the kind of face-to-face contacts the users made in that time. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it.

An\"index case\"is somebody who has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe latest weekly statistics published for the test and trace system in England by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) show that 8,908 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 were transferred to the contact tracing system. \n\nOf these, 83% were reached and asked to provide details of close contacts. \n\nThe rest were not reached because they did not respond to text, email, and call reminders, or they refused to give details of close contacts, or there were no contact details for them.\n\nOf the 7,367 people who were reached, 18% were not able to give any recent close contacts. This was because either they had none or because they didn't have details of people they might have come into contact with - they could have been strangers who they sat next to on a bus journey, for example.\n\nThat leaves 6,044 people who provided details for one or more close contacts. NHS Test and Trace identified 32,359 of those recent close contacts and reached 69% of them - the lowest percentage since the service launched.\n\nIf you look only at close contacts for whom contact details were provided, then 79% were reached.\n\nIt seems this figure - which was 80% for the previous week - was the one to which Mr Johnson was referring. Earlier on in his exchange with Sir Keir, the prime minister correctly qualified the number by saying\"of those contacts who supply details, 80% are reached\". \n\nHowever, the advice from the government's scientific advisers refers to reaching at least 80% of contacts of all positive cases, regardless of how hard it is to get contact details.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nSo, although we can't put a precise figure on it (without knowing about the contacts we don't know about), it's clear that NHS Test and Trace is a long way off satisfying the advice to contact at least 80% of contacts of all people who have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care didn't respond to the specific points raised here. \n\nWhen the latest weekly figures were published, Baroness Dido Harding, who oversees NHS Test and Trace, insisted that the system\"is working, and every week we consistently reach the majority of people testing positive and their contacts\".\n\nMore or Less is on BBC Radio 4 at 09:30 BST on Wednesdays and repeated at 16:30 on Fridays and 20:00 on Sundays.

Should we let the big chimpanzee out of his cage?\n\nFor several weeks I'd been on a kind of suburban safari, on the trail of America's large and growing population of exotic wild animals that are kept as pets.\n\nIn Indiana, I'd had a close encounter with a baboon called Tatiana. I'd also spent several days getting to know a few of the more than 150 tigers at an\"Exotic Animal Sanctuary\"in Oklahoma, though mostly through the bars.\n\nBut this chimpanzee, called Cooper, was a step up on the exotic animal danger-scale. He belonged to a couple called Jill and Brad James.\n\nThe owners of a funeral home, they'd raised two daughters when they decided to take on Cooper. Later, to give Cooper some company, they added a second, younger chimp called Tukem Kerry into the mix.\n\nEven in the world of exotic animals, chimps are considered somewhat controversial.\n\nFully grown men who would think nothing of rolling around on the ground with a lion would politely decline the opportunity to get in a cage with an adult chimpanzee. Many are mindful of the infamous\"Travis incident\".\n\nTravis, a 14-year-old, 200lb (91kg) chimpanzee, had once been the star of several TV commercials. He lived in suburban Connecticut with his owner Sandra Herold, sipping wine from a stemmed glass and occasionally popping a Xanax. One day in 2009, he viciously attacked a human neighbour, ripping off her face and chewing off several of her fingers.\n\nChimp owners have been fighting an uphill publicity battle ever since.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, with a little trepidation, I'd spent some one-on-one time with the James' smaller chimp, Tukem Kerry. He is only five years old and the size of a human toddler, though much hairier and with long, powerful arms.\n\nTormented by visions of him biting off my nose or chewing off my testicles, I was relieved when he clambered up onto me to offer nothing more menacing than a hug.\n\nBut Cooper is two years older and close to sexual maturity. This makes him much more potentially dangerous, notwithstanding that his testicles are in a jar in Brad and Jill's garage.\n\nExotic animal ownership is rampant in the US. According to one oft-repeated factoid, there are more tigers in Texas than in India.\n\nOnly last week in Ohio a man with a menagerie of more than 50 animals, including tigers, giraffes and bears, decided to open up his cages and then shoot himself in the head - after being convicted of animal cruelty.\n\nLocal schools were closed down while authorities tried to track down the animals. Police shot some of the tigers as they stood rather pathetically (the tigers, not the police) outside their cages.\n\nQuite why anyone would enjoy having an animal that could easily kill him is not easy to say. Why not own a creature you can stroke and cuddle and tease with a piece of string?\n\nOf course, you can stroke and cuddle a baby lion, tiger or chimp, and therein lies part of the problem. Animals that are cute and huggable in infancy later grow into potential man-killers.\n\nMost tiger owners let them roam the house for the first year or so of their lives. After that they are locked up for the rest of their lives, which can be as much as 20 years. \n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) registered facilities are required to provide\"sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement\".\n\nIn practice, an animal that roams hundreds of miles in the wild can find itself contained in a space no bigger than a living room.\n\nAs for chimps, they get to enjoy their first eight to 10 years with direct human interaction. But after that they too tend to be locked away. Given that they can live to be as many as 60 or 65 years old, that's a pretty long stretch behind bars.\n\nSome owners tire of their animals as they get older and become too unpredictable to play with. Others run out of money or pre-decease their pets.\n\nThe prices tell the story. A baby chimpanzee can go for as much as $50,000 (\u00a331,195) or $60,000 (\u00a337434). An adult chimpanzee has no market value.\n\nAbandoned adult animals end up in sanctuaries. But in one of the paradoxes of the exotics world, some of the sanctuaries that rescue animals also breed animals to defray their expenses - thereby, arguably, making the problem of surplus adults even worse.\n\nAs chimp owners, Jill and Brad are in many respects paragons. They have built their hairy friends a large-ish enclosure at the bottom of the garden where they have ropes to swing on, toys and TV to watch.\n\nThey say they still spend plenty of time with them. I watched  luxuriating in a warm shower, he seemed especially keen on the shampoo (drinking it more than washing with it).\n\nJill and Brad say they are committed to Cooper and Tukem Kerry for the long term. But even they admit that as the chimps get older, they may have to play with them\"through the bars\".\n\nAs for my alone time with Cooper, when the time came, though he did come out of the cage, after some soul-searching I decided to\"enjoy\"him from afar. From the safety of inside the James' house, with the doors locked.\n\nI watched him as he frolicked in the garden. He rode the sit-down mower, got a coke from the pool-side cabana, then relaxed in the hot tub.\n\nNo, I didn't get to grapple with him.\n\nBut on the plus side, I've still got my face.\nTL;DR: There are more tigers in captivity in the US than in the wild in the whole of Asia, according to some estimates. But the trade in exotic pets has dangerous consequences for man and beast alike, writes Louis Theroux.\n\nArticle: By Ian WestbrookBBC News\n\nBut there are warnings that the recent Facebook craze could actually be a risk to our online security.\n\nThe first gig you went to is often one of the security questions which banks and other organisations ask when setting up an account - and revealing that information online, even in an innocent online post, could make you more vulnerable to hackers.\n\n\"I wouldn't do it,\"said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.\n\n\"But it's difficult to tell people not to take part, as it is part of their social interaction and has become the norm.\n\n\"What I would say is to think very carefully about what you are putting into the public domain.\"\n\nProf Angela Sasse, director of the UK Research Institute in Science of Cyber-security, said she feels that the companies are to blame for any security breach rather than individuals.\n\n\"The risk is not so much publishing these lists, rather that somebody thinks it is a good idea to use questions like that as security credentials,\"she told the BBC.\n\n\"Companies are violating the security principle that the way of authenticating people should be private - such as a password or Pin number - rather than something that is publicly available.\"\n\nPeople are often warned not to post their holiday photos on social media sites in case it alerts potential burglars to the fact that their house is unoccupied.\n\nHowever, Prof Woodward said it is very difficult to prove if homes are targeted as a result of people showing their friends a picture of themselves on the beach.\n\n\"It is practically impossible to correlate numbers of burglaries of holidaymakers who are active on social media - but what is clear is the more personal information you put out there, the more is likely to be used by hackers.\"\n\n'Not stupid'\n\nThere had been some suggestions that the concerts question had been set up by the criminal underworld, but Prof Woodward dismissed that theory.\n\nHe told the BBC:\"This is not something that cyber-criminals would concoct - but they are not stupid and they will see the potential in it.\n\n\"It is better for them to co-opt on to something that is part of the mainstream rather than produce something new, as people tend not to trust new things.\"\n\nYou might think that turning up your Facebook privacy settings may eliminate the risk in sharing a list of your favourite gigs - but Prof Woodward is not so sure.\n\n\"How do you know the list you are responding to actually comes from who says it comes from?\"he said.\n\n\"You think you know who are you talking to but you can't be 100% certain. If my email account gets hacked, my friends get emails apparently from me asking for some information. The same sort of thing could potentially happen with these lists.\"\n\nProf Sasse added:\"The privacy settings are too complex and when privacy policies change, people often have to do it all over again which doesn't help them.\"\n\nFacebook's top six security tips to keep your account safe:\n\nSource: Facebook \n\nSecurity for online accounts is becoming more sophisticated, however, and Prof Woodward said there are easy ways for people to improve their personal safety on the web.\n\n\"One thing banks and other companies can do is get you to specify the question you need to answer to access your account, rather than using stock questions.\n\n\"Two-factor authentication is an obvious way of making accounts more secure. A lot of banks make it available, but not everybody turns it on - in some cases it is only an option, but I think it will increasingly be there by default.\n\n\"People should also use a password manager that will generate proper strong passwords which will also mean they are not using the same password for their accounts.\n\n\"The best password is one you can't remember.\"\nTL;DR: Comparing lists on social media of the top 10 concerts you have ever attended seems like a harmless enough pastime.\n\nArticle: The case has been raised by four of his constituents in Orkney and Shetland.\n\nThey argue he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister.\n\nThe case is due in court next month with more than \u00a360,000 already raised but now more is being sought.\n\nMr Carmichael had initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe said that the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.\n\nThe MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted that the\"details of the account are not correct\".\n\nThe official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo found that Mr Carmichael had given permission to his former special adviser Euan Roddin to hand details of the memo to the newspaper. \n\nCampaigners raised \u00a360,000 in crowd-funding to lodge the legal challenge to his election under the Representation of the People Act 1983.\nTL;DR: The team behind the campaign to overturn the election of Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael has launched a second appeal for funding.\n\nArticle: By Becky BranfordBBC News\n\nAcross the continent the hand of the Russian state has been perceived in an array of cyber attacks on government and state institutions, in the phenomenon of\"fake news\"and disinformation, and in the targeted funding of opposition groups.\n\nSo how real is the threat and what form does it take? And is an explanation to be found in the words of Russia's chief of the general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, who wrote in a military newspaper in 2013 that\"the very rules of war have changed\"?\n\nWhat's so new about information warfare?\n\nAttempting to control information has long been part of the weaponry of many powerful states. \n\nBut Russia's concerted effort to cultivate techniques of information warfare and non-military intervention over recent years is something new, says Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre.\n\n\"At various stages in the first and second Chechen wars, the war with Georgia in 2008, Russia found it was not able to influence global opinion or the opinion of its adversaries at an operational or strategic level, and made significant changes to its information warfare apparatus as a result,\"he says.\n\n\"In the Georgia war, they found that to influence world public opinion and to properly exploit the connectivity of the internet they needed to start a massive recruitment campaign to bring in linguists, journalists, anybody who could talk directly to populations in foreign countries en masse\".\n\nWhat techniques are available?\n\nHACKING\n\nNumerous cyber attacks in Europe have been blamed on Russian-linked groups - many of them spectacular. \n\nIn 2015 France's TV5Monde broadcaster was taken off air and its systems nearly entirely destroyed. \n\nThe same year Russia's APT28 hacking group was accused of a massive data hack of deputies in Germany's lower house of parliament involving the loss of 16 gigabytes of data. Germany's head of domestic intelligence has since spoken of a\"hybrid\"Russian threat to the September 2017 elections in which Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term in office.\n\nAnother cyber attack, on Bulgaria in October 2016, was described by its president as the heaviest and most intense to be conducted in south-eastern Europe.\n\nThese types of attack date back 10 years, when Estonia, a cyber pioneer and former Soviet state, was hit by a massive denial-of-service attack rendering websites inaccessible with a barrage of requests.\n\nThe potential power of attacking a country's internet infrastructure suddenly became clear, with an Estonian defence spokesman comparing the attacks to those launched against the US on 11 September 2001. \n\nHacking is not just an issue in cyber-space, it can have enormous consequences far beyond. An attack on a Ukrainian power plant in 2015 led to days of blackout. \n\nRead more: Bears with keyboards - Russian hackers snoop on West\n\nBOOSTING OPPOSITION PARTIES\n\nSenior Russian political figures have long cultivated relationships with nationalist and often anti-EU parties in Europe. \n\nIn France, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front received a \u20ac9m loan from a Russian bank in 2014 (then \u00a37m; $11m). On 24 March, with the French election only a month away and a chance of victory in the race, she met President Putin during a trip to Moscow. \n\nIn February, the leader of right-wing nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), Frauke Petry, held talks in Moscow with MPs close to President Putin and with Russian ultranationalists. \n\nAnd in Austria, the far-right Freedom Party of Austria denied claims it had received money from Moscow after signing a co-operation agreement with Mr Putin's United Russia party.\n\nApparently it is not just the right. In France and Germany, leading far-left groups also have key links to the Russian state, according to this study by the Atlantic Council.\n\nFAKE NEWS AND DISINFORMATION\n\nThere is nothing new about disinformation - intentionally spreading false facts.\n\nNow there is\"fake news\"too - false or misleading reporting often originating from little-known fringe websites that claim they are providing an alternative to the\"lying\"mainstream media. \n\nThe US presidential election was notoriously hit by it and many European countries have been too. \n\nWhen Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014, the leaders that took over from Ukraine's deposed leader were painted as fascists, justifying their intervention. The story contained enough of a kernel of truth to be persuasive. The leadership was neither a\"fascist junta\"nor\"completely fascist-free\", as the BBC's David Stern said at the time.\n\nWeeks before an Italian referendum that brought down Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in December 2016, Kremlin-funded TV Russia Today broadcast a rally on Facebook Live from Rome's Piazza del Populo. \n\n\"Protests against Italian PM hit Rome,\"it announced to hundreds of thousands of viewers. In reality, it was a rally backing Mr Renzi.\n\nIn Germany, a 13-year-old girl,\"Lisa\", told police she had been raped by people of\"Mediterranean appearance\"in January 2016. Russian state TV seized on the story, reporting it intensively and triggering anti-migrant protests against Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nIt was later established the story was false, and Berlin hit out at Moscow for making political capital out of the case.\n\nPressing Moscow's case are Russian-backed news organisations such as RT and Sputnik. and, on social media, an army of\"internet trolls\".\n\nThe EU is so worried that it has established a unit of experts explicitly tasked with tackling\"Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns\".\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRussia: The scandal Trump can't shake\n\nRussia and the West: A century of subversion and suspicion\n\nCan we be sure Russia is behind all this?\n\nRussia denies it. President Vladimir Putin says US intelligence claims of interference are absurd and irresponsible. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has even accused the CIA of masquerading as Russian hackers.\n\nBut, according to Keir Giles, Russia\"is becoming less and less interested in covering its tracks\". Its interference in the US election was more or less overt, he argues, and it was happy to permit dozens of Western journalists to visit a notorious St Petersburg troll farm.\n\nThat is, he says,\"partly because of a sense of urgency that the next conflict is coming\".\n\nAn EU official told the BBC that disinformation campaigns were not always top-down.\"It's not like every single piece of it is orchestrated by the Kremlin,\"the official said. \n\n\"It's about creating this ecosystem that works in significant parts almost independently\", with actors working for financial motives such as clicks or funding from Russian organisations.\n\nIn the case of the\"Lisa\"rape case in Germany, the story originated on a small blog, not in Moscow.\n\nBut it is telling, says the official, that journalists behind the propaganda are decorated with state medals - including 300 journalists covering Russia's annexation of Crimea and 60 pushing a pro-Kremlin narrative on Syria. \n\nWhat is Russia trying to achieve?\n\nFor some critics, the answer is simply power.\n\nPresident Putin and his allies have created\"an image of the external enemy from the West\u2026 this demand was dormant, Putin awakened it,\"says Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\n\"His goal is to be a world leader, but on his own terms.\"\n\nOthers are more nuanced.\n\nFor Maria Lipman, while anti-Western sentiment in Russia has been nurtured by the state, the mindset of a fortress under siege\"is not necessarily unfounded\". She points to the sanctions imposed by the US and EU\"couched in the language of punishing Russia to hurt its economy\".\n\nMany chart the decline of Russian relations with Europe from Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004-5, seen in Moscow as\"regime change\", through Russia's gas wars with Ukraine, its 2008 conflict with Georgia to the crisis and conflict in Ukraine. It was the 2014 annexation of Crimea that led to the sanctions.\n\nFor Gonzalo Pozo Martin of Stockholm University, the pain of those sanctions has been felt most intensely in Russia and has coincided with falling oil prices. \n\nHe argues that Russia's\"cosying up\"to the hard right in Europe is a form of leverage over the sanctions and deadlock in eastern Ukraine. But he also believes the Kremlin is investing long term in a more amenable, less Atlanticist EU.\n\nNot only would that boost Russian influence, it\"might afford Russia a freer hand over its former-Soviet neighbours\", he suggests.\nTL;DR: Russia has been accused of trying to interfere in the US presidential election, through hacked Democrat emails and social media. \n\nAnd in a big year of European elections, political leaders in France, Germany and elsewhere are looking over their shoulders too.\n\nArticle: The supermodel posted the magazine's last staff photo, which featured no black faces among the 55-strong team.\n\nIt was taken before Edward Enninful took the reins as the magazine's first black editor earlier this month.\n\n\"Looking forward to an inclusive and diverse staff now that @edward_enninful is the editor,\"Campbell wrote on Instagram.\n\nBroadcaster and commentator Edward Adoo said the Vogue staff photo looked like a snapshot of\"very old school Britain\".\n\nHe told BBC News:\"It seemed there was no room for anyone else.

In 2013, the gap was 2.8% and 1.8% the previous year.\n\nThe results breakdown suggests that London has been consistently the top achiever, with the South West and East Anglia improving.\n\nBut the analysis also shows that the gap at GCSE level is not consistent with primary school tests or A-levels.\n\nThe gap in national tests at the end of primary schools has been much narrower - with the most recent results showing a 1.1% difference. \n\nThe analysis suggests that once deprivation is taken into account, northern primary schools could be seen as more effective than their southern counterparts - with the exception of London which combines both high levels of deprivation and high results.\n\nSchoolDash founder Timo Hannay says the overview shows that regional performance up to the age of seven\"correlates closely with deprivation except in London, which does unusually well\". \n\nUp to the age of 11,\"northern schools tend to make better progress but once those kids go to secondary school their average performance falls well behind their compatriots in the south\".\nTL;DR: This year's GCSE results in England show few signs of a north-south divide getting any narrower.\n\nArticle: By Prof James LoganLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\nBut the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets.

            "test_query": "By Prof James LoganLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\nBut the islands are not just beautiful. They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them. \n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness. \n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites. \n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments. \n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes.  It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation. \n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease. \n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission. \n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present. \n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination. \n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it. \n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world. \n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe.  Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.  \n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands  - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease. \n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides. \n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed. \n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the\"intervention\"islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the\"control\"islands, will not. \n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria. \n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist,  on the islands. \n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands. \n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research. \n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population. \n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

One of them, as everyone now knows, on child sexual abuse.\n\nThe trouble with twinkle-toed Dickens, who enjoyed telling tales of his exploits at tea dances in Leicester Square, that he never seemed to be quite sure of the difference between the trivial and the serious.\n\nAnd he had a gift for farce. The press conference at which he announced that he was going to pull out a skeleton from his own closet (in the form of a glamorous partner from one of the tea dances) turned into a famous Westminster occasion when he asked the reporters summoned to hear his confession - if they could hold back the news for a short time.\n\nUnaware that a number had already left the room to phone their news desk, and Mrs Dickens, he admitted he had wanted a little time because he called the press conference and rattled the skeleton in public without having taken the trouble to tell his wife first.\n\nThe picture of a cheery bumbler was complete. He was much mocked, and much liked, perhaps because there was an evident authenticity in his working class Tory style, despite his habit at Question Time of sounding as if he was auditioning for an end of the pier show (\"Mr Speaker, I want to do a favour for every woman in this country\").\n\nBut when he started to talk about having assembled a dossier that named names and told a story of paedophile networks in high places, was it not surprising that everyone had a tremor of doubt?\n\nWas it more of a performance than a serious investigation? The question was natural, because Geoffrey was Geoffrey.\n\nNow the dossier is back, though the MP who compiled it never seemed to have kept a copy himself, and long years passed after his initial accusations in the early 1980s with little progress on his part. His naming in the Commons of a former diplomat, Sir Peter Hayman, as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) turned out to be an arrow accurately aimed, but of others we heard nothing.\n\nThe reason may have as much to do with the atmosphere of the time as with Dickens himself. There was little of the public concern with paedophilia at the time, almost as if a kind of innocence still attended the subject: many people were simply unwilling to imagine acts that are now discussed openly, and there was no welter of internet comment and campaign on the subject.\n\nIndeed, a sense of disbelief still swirled around the subject. And the trouble was that Dickens, well known as a rent-a-quote MP with a colourful opinion ready to be pulled out of his hat at a moment's notice, was the worst person to dispel it.\n\nHe was no methodical campaigner, pursuing his leads and building his case, but a slash and burn man ready to speak about dark conspiracies (he pointed to burglaries at his home and threats against him after speaking about paedophilia), but without a steady hand on the tiller. In the end, it was Geoffrey and people would shrug their shoulders.\n\nListeners who heard the rebroadcast comments of Tim Fortescue, a former Conservative whip from the Heath-era speaking in a documentary years after, will get the real sense of the times. A chap - it was usually a chap - would come to the whips, and confess his trouble. Sex, money, drink. A brush with the law. You name it. And what happened? They helped out quietly. \n\nThat was the tenor of the time. It was the same in all the whips' offices, and everyone knew it.\n\nNo doubt it still goes on, but I would venture to say that it is less brazen.\n\nAnd whether we will ever see the Dickens dossier, who knows? If we did, I imagine we would find that there were some nuggets in there, but quite a lot of fools' gold too.\n\nHe was probably the wrong man, though he remained a popular figure, especially in the last illness (he died in 1995) which he handled with great courage. And perhaps his dossier died with him.\n\nWhatever we may make of his credentials as a campaigner, that may be a pity.\nTL;DR: The Today programme's James Naughtie, who was a parliamentary lobby correspondent in the 1970s and 80s, remembers Geoffrey Dickens, the colourful Conservative MP whose dossier on an alleged paedophile network is now the focus of a new inquiry.\n\nArticle: Two Swedes and one Belgian also died in the attack on Friday, when a hijacked lorry was driven into a store.\n\nHis family said they were devastated by the\"untimely and tragic death\"of the\"wonderful husband, son, father, brother and close friend to many\".\n\nThe suspect, a 39-year-old man from Uzbekistan, had been facing deportation, Swedish police said.\n\nCrispin Bevington - known as Chris - worked as a director with music streaming service Spotify. The father-of-two was based in Stockholm with his family.\n\nHis father John said:\"We are all devastated by the untimely and tragic death of our talented, compassionate and caring son Chris. \n\n\"A wonderful husband, son, father, brother and close friend to many.\n\n\"The family requests absolute privacy at this incredibly difficult time to mourn his passing in peace.\"\n\nCo-founder of Spotify, Daniel Ek, confirmed Mr Bevington's death with\"shock and a heavy heart\". \n\nHe said:\"He has had a great impact on not just the business but on everyone who had the privilege to know and work with him. \n\n\"There are no words for how missed he will be or for how sad we all are to have lost him like this.\n\n\"Whilst this terrible news is sinking in, our primary focus is on supporting the family and loved ones of Chris in any way we possibly can.\n\nMr Ek said he was as\"deeply saddened and upset\"as everyone that such an attack could happen in Sweden. The only light, he said, was the consequent\"outpouring of love, compassion and solidarity\".\n\nHe added:\"We will greatly miss you Chris. Rest in Peace my friend.\"\n\nIn a press conference on Sunday, police said the suspect was known to have extremist sympathies.\n\nA further 15 people were injured in the attack. Ten are still being treated in hospital, four of them in a serious condition.   \n\nPolice later said they had found a suspect device inside the lorry, which had been hijacked from a beer company before hitting the Ahlens store. \n\nNo terrorist group has claimed to be behind the attack. \n\nA UK Foreign Office spokesman said:\"Stockholm Police have confirmed that a British man was killed during the attack in Stockholm.\n\n\"We are supporting his family in Sweden and in the UK. Our thoughts are with them and all those affected at this terrible time. \n\n\"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with Sweden as they deal with this tragedy.\"\n\n'Marginal character'\n\nStockholm police said the suspected attacker, arrested later on Friday, had previously been sought by authorities for deportation. \n\nHe had sought residency in Sweden in 2014, but his application was rejected last year.

India said both sides suffered casualties, but China is yet to confirm its number of dead or injured.\n\nThe countries have since begun talks and even agreed to start disengaging despite rhetoric that was increasingly hostile. It's unclear how the latest ban will affect ongoing talks. \n\nBut experts such as Mr Roy say there are other concerns too. \n\n\"What's worrying is falling back on\"national security and threats to sovereignty\"for so many different actions, whether against student protests or app bans,\"he says, referring to a slew of controversial arrests of activists and critics of the government in the last two years.\"\n\nHe says the lack of privacy laws in India is\"also worrying\", especially three years after a landmark Supreme Court judgment that upheld privacy as a fundamental right. \n\n\"Too many apps, Indian as well as American, collect way more data and permissions than they need to,\"he adds. \n\n\"A more selective approach to this would have been picking out top potential offenders, spelling out SOPs [rules] for data disclosure, following a one-strike-and-you're-out [policy] for violations, defining a clear period for the ban and allowing firms to submit compliance reports on data privacy.\"\nTL;DR: Chinese e-commerce platform AliExpress is the latest casualty in yet another Indian ban on Chinese mobile apps.\n\nArticle: By Zoe ThomasTechnology reporter\n\nThe firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy.\n\nBut activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook.\n\nThe group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further. \n\n\"As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,\"said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting the measure.\n\nFacebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans.\n\nFacebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet. \n\n\"As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,\"it said.\n\nThe measure is unlikely to pass. \n\nMost of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives.\n\nPlans for more encryption \n\nIn March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened.\n\nThe initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself.\n\nWhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security. \n\nThe US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this.\n\nThe measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate\"the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children\"as a consequence.\n\nIn 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook.\n\nAccording to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm.\n\nFor Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security.\n\nUsers have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised.\n\nIt would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved.\n\nReputational risk to Facebook\n\nSome investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company.\n\n\"Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,\"said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.  \n\n\"The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly.\n\n\"When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,\"he said in October.\n\nBut he added that he was\"optimistic\"that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.\nTL;DR: Investors at Facebook's annual stockholder meeting will vote on a proposal to postpone the firm's plans for end-to-end encryption.\n\nArticle: Charlotte Brown was killed when she was thrown into the water along with Jack Shepherd, 30, while the pair were on a first date in December 2015.\n\nThe Old Bailey was told her body temperature was just 25C when she was pulled out of the river by the RNLI.\n\nMr Shepherd, from Paddington, denies manslaughter by gross negligence.\n\nThe jury has heard he had tried to impress Ms Brown, 23, with a boat trip past the Houses of Parliament after a meal at The Shard.\n\nHowever, the craft flipped over when she was driving and hit a log in the river.\n\nThe web designer was found clinging to the upturned hull of the boat and Ms Brown was pulled from the water by RNLI crew members.

with several commanding UK ships - and it recently allowed women to serve on submarines as well, although not in the Royal Marines.\n\nTiny percentage\n\nYet previous military reviews have concluded that allowing women into roles where their primary purpose is to\"close with and kill the enemy\"would not work - and could have a negative impact on morale and unit cohesion in fighting units such as the infantry and Royal Marines. \n\nThe last MoD review in 2010 concluded that while women were both\"physically and psychologically\"capable of the job of close combat, the effects of\"gender mixing\"on team cohesion were unknown and could have\"far-reaching and grave consequences\".\n\nHowever, times have changed, and other countries such as America recently decided to allow women into front-line combat roles, which has also had an impact on UK defence thinking. \n\nThose countries that already do so, including Canada, Australia, South Africa and Israel, say it has worked - though women still form a tiny percentage of their combat arms, for example just under 3% in Canada. \n\nToday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond hinted strongly that this time, the correct answer to the question of whether British women should be able to fight on the front line alongside their male colleagues should be yes, though the idea of women in close combat roles in the infantry remains controversial.\n\nPhysical challenge\n\nMr Hammond also made clear that fitness standards would not be lowered, which could mean that not many women are able to qualify for those roles, which can mean carrying the equivalent of your own bodyweight in kit and weaponry for days at a time on the battlefield.\n\nMany of the arguments that have traditionally been deployed against allowing women into front-line combat roles were used against allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the military, yet unit cohesion and morale on the front line do not appear to have suffered since the ban was lifted in 2000. \n\nFew are expecting an enormous rush of women eager to join the infantry, but there are definitely some who want to be given the chance to try. \n\nThree women - Sergeant Sarah Bryant from the Intelligence Corps, Army bomb disposal expert Captain Lisa Head and Army medic Corporal Channing Day - have been killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan while serving on the front lines.\n\nSo women's courage and their resourcefulness in combat is not in any doubt. \n\nNonetheless, if women are allowed into the combat arms, their first fight will be to prove themselves physically and mentally up to the immense challenge, and win round the sceptics\nTL;DR: Several thousand servicewomen have done tours of duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere - often on the front lines - and many have successfully combined motherhood and military duty.\n\nArticle: Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Friday was his last day. \n\nHis exit follows a review of his position by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\n\nMr Bannon, who helped shape Mr Trump's\"America First\"campaign message, is returning as head of Breitbart.com, and says he will remain loyal.\n\nThe 63-year-old is executive chairman of the website, which has been accused of voicing anti-Semitic and white supremacist views.\n\nIn another departure from Mr Trump's team, billionaire investor Carl Icahn announced he was ending his role as the president's special advisor on regulatory reform, after facing criticism that his advice could benefit his own businesses.\n\nMr Bannon is known to have competed for influence in the West Wing against more moderate factions, including members of the Trump family.\n\nHe told the Bloomberg TV network:\"I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents - on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.\"\n\nMr Trump raised eyebrows earlier this year when he elevated Mr Bannon to the National Security Council, the main group advising the president on national security and foreign affairs.\n\nBut he was subsequently removed from the council in a move that was seen as a sign of National Security Adviser HR McMaster's growing influence over the president.  \n\nMr Bannon has reportedly feuded with Mr McMaster as well as Gary Cohn, the director of the president's National Economic Council and a former Goldman Sachs chief viewed as a globalist. \n\nMr Cohn, along with President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter, Ivanka Trump, were viewed as threats to Mr Bannon's White House agenda. \n\nTaking credit did him in\n\nBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter\n\nSteve Bannon may be out as a senior White House adviser, but Bannonism - if that's what it can properly be called - is still firmly entrenched in the White House.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly boasted that the success of his presidential campaign should properly be attributed to him, not Mr Bannon. And, in the end, Mr Bannon's desire to take credit for that win may have been what did him in.\n\nIt certainly wasn't because of any sharp ideological divides between the president and the former head of Breitbart News.\n\nBorder security, aggressive trade protectionism, immigration reform and a certain kind of cultural nostalgia - all were themes that Mr Trump ran on from the start, which Mr Bannon only sharpened and focused. They're also issues Mr Trump has pushed in recent weeks, even as Mr Bannon has been increasingly marginalised.\n\nMr Bannon's firing will be seen as a win for Chief of Staff John Kelly, whose attempts to instil discipline in the White House will get a boost without the free-wheeling Mr Bannon roaming the hallways.\n\nTrump was Trump before Mr Bannon came on the scene, however. And as the rollercoaster ride that was politics this week indicates, the president isn't changing anytime soon.\n\nMr Trump fuelled speculation when asked last week about Mr Bannon's future as he replied:\"We'll see.\"\n\nMr Bannon's interview this week with the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, reportedly infuriated the president.\n\nThe White House aide was quoted as dismissing the idea of a military solution in North Korea, undercutting Mr Trump.\n\nHe told the magazine the US was\"at economic war with China\"and that he aimed to push out moderates whom he believed were soft on China. \n\nMr Bannon told associates he thought it was an off-the-record chat and did not realise he would be quoted.\n\nHe has pushed for imposing additional tariffs on China and other trade partners to reduce deficits with those countries.\n\nHe also advocated for a travel ban on citizens of certain Muslim-majority countries. \n\nMs Huckabee Sanders' statement said:\"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. \n\n\"We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\"\n\nSource familiar with the decision said Mr Bannon had been given the chance to leave on his own terms.\n\nWho else left Trump's White House team?\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, communications director - 31 July\n\nReince Priebus, chief of staff - 28 July\n\nSean Spicer, press secretary - 21 July\n\nMike Dubke, communications director, 30 May\n\nMichael Flynn, national security adviser - 14 February\n\nThis photo sums up White House turmoil\n\nMr Bannon took over as chief of Trump's presidential campaign in August 2016.\n\nHe was formerly a US Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker, Hollywood movie producer and head of Breitbart News.\n\nThe right-wing outlet that has boisterously supported Mr Trump announced his return within hours.\n\nBreitbart's senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak tweeted:\"#WAR\"before Bannon made it clear he was staying on the president's side.\nTL;DR: White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is the latest top aide of President Donald Trump to leave his post.\n\nArticle: Three-quarters of the budget, \u00a311bn, goes on pay, and Theresa May told force leaders in London that must change.\n\nMrs May said she wanted officers' pay to be frozen for two years along with that of other public sector workers.\n\nSimon Reed, from the Police Federation, said she\"clearly undervalued\"the work of officers and morale would suffer.\n\nThe government is planning to cut its funding for the police by 20% by 2015.\n\nMrs May's speech comes ahead of the publication of a review of police wages and conditions next week.\n\nThe review, by former rail regulator Tom Winsor, will consider cuts to overtime payments, and housing and travel allowances, and will also suggest changes to shift patterns, and procedures for retirement and redundancy.\n\nPolice'let down'\n\nThe home secretary told the meeting in Westminster the government had identified ways of making savings by cutting bureaucracy and improving the procurement of equipment and other services.  \n\nBut she said:\"There's no question that pay restraint and pay reform must form part of the package.\n\n\"I want to protect police jobs and keep officers on the street, and we can only do that if we reform pay and conditions for all officers.\"\n\nThe government announced last year that it would introduce a two-year pay freeze for all public sector workers earning \u00a321,000 or more.\n\nMrs May said that subject to any recommendations from the police negotiating board, implementation of the freeze in 2011-12 and 2012-13 would save \u00a3350m.\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said the police were being\"let down by a system that has far too many officers in back-office roles\".\n\n\"That's what needs to change, along with some of the working practices that frankly aren't actually modern and up to date,\"he said.\n\n\"We need to make sure that happens so we keep the maximum number of police on the front line in our communities.\"\n\nAnd he added:\"As in so many areas we inherited a police service [that was] completely inefficient, not properly managed by the party opposite.\"\n\nEarlier, the prime minister's official spokesman told reporters:\"If you are going to find savings, pay is a good place to start.\"\n\n'End bonuses'\n\nBut Mr Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said Mrs May's talk of reform was\"a euphemism for cuts\". \n\n\"She clearly undervalues what we do, despite what she says. Words are cheap, but actions speak louder,\"he said. \n\nMr Reed also said the pay freeze would mean\"a considerable sacrifice\"for officers and their families, and accused the home secretary of undermining the Winsor review by making her speech ahead of its publication. \n\nShadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had\"put chief constables in an impossible position with a 20% front-loaded cut to their budgets\".\n\n\"This is a desperate and disingenuous attempt to distract people from the fact that whatever reforms are introduced, police forces across the country have already said they are being forced to cut the jobs of around 10,000 police officers,\"she added.  \n\nHowever, Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said officers were\"realistic\"and hoped wage cuts would save jobs.\n\n\"I think most of our staff would obviously understand that bargain,\"he added.\n\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers has suggested scrapping a host of additional payments and bonuses, as well as reducing the amount of overtime paid for working on public holidays. \n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has also called for an end to all bonuses for police officers.\n\nBut the BBC's home affairs correspondent Andy Tighe said there were fears within the Police Federation, which represents officers, that removing additional payments for anti-social or dangerous work could deter high-quality candidates from applying to join the police. \n\nIn 2008, the then Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith rejected a recommended pay increase, but was forced to back down after marches by officers.\n\nLast year, a report by the independent Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said spending on overtime in England and Wales had increased by 90% since 1998 despite a record rise in the number of officers.\n\nThe police overtime bill in 2009 was nearly \u00a3400m.\nTL;DR: Pay cuts for police officers are essential in order to minimise front-line job losses at forces in England and Wales, the home secretary has said.\n\nArticle: It has led to calls for Douglas Ross to stand down from his frontbench role as the party's justice spokesman. \n\nHe was an assistant referee at the clash between Sporting Lisbon and Real Madrid on Tuesday. \n\nBut it meant he was unable to attend a justice committee meeting in the Scottish Parliament. \n\nMr Ross earns up to \u00a340,000 a year as a self-employed specialist assistant football referee, according to his Scottish Parliament register of interests. \n\nHe is also a councillor with Moray Council and his trip to Portugal meant he missed its policy and resources committee meeting on Tuesday. \n\nSNP MSP Ben Macpherson said it was not the first time Mr Ross's refereeing job had affected his parliamentary work. \n\nIt has been reported that he missed a key vote in parliament when he was in Switzerland taking part in World Cup referee training. \n\nMr Macpherson said:\"The arrogance and blatant disrespect of'three jobs' Tory Douglas Ross is simply staggering.\n\n\"Last time the whistle was blown on one of his refereeing junkets the Tories claimed it was just a'one off'. But he's at it again - and this time it should be a straight red card. \n\n\"Obviously he values his \u00a340k-a-year weekend job - and all-expenses paid trips to Lisbon and other European cities - more than his responsibilities as an MSP and local councillor, demonstrating complete contempt for the people who elected him. \n\n\"If Douglas Ross can't pitch up to do his job, it's time for relegation - he should either take a step back from refereeing or stand down from Holyrood's justice committee with immediate effect, and Ruth Davidson should give him the boot from her frontbench team.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said:\"Earlier this year Ben Macpherson asked Douglas to kindly speak to clubs in his constituency about refereeing - presumably this invitation has now been rescinded.\"\n\nMr Ross did not comment.\nTL;DR: A leading Scottish Conservative MSP missed a parliamentary committee to referee a Champions League match in Portugal.\n\nArticle: During the White House correspondents' annual dinner Mr Obama showed a picture of a White House with girls in bikinis sipping cocktails in a hot tub. \n\nThe president also made fun of rumours that he was not born in the US.\n\nMr Trump, a potential Republican presidential candidate, had recently revived the conspiracy theory.\n\nMr Obama said that after he released his long-form birth certificate this week in order to settle the issue, Mr Trump could now turn his attention to more serious matters such as,\"Did we fake the Moon landing?\"\n\nDuring the dinner comedian Seth Meyers also teased Mr Trump, who sat stony-faced through the barrage.\n\n\"Donald Trump often talks about running as a Republican, which is surprising,\"said Mr Meyers.\"I just assumed he was running as a joke.\"\nTL;DR: US President Barack Obama has sent up Donald Trump's presidential ambitions, joking that the real-estate mogul would turn the White House into a casino.\n\nArticle: The trust that manages St Mary's Church in Clophill, Bedfordshire, said it came from\"professional advice\"on saving the gravestones for the future. \n\nClophill Heritage Trust said the stones, which now form part of the Poetry and Peace Path, had already moved from original sites in the 1960s. \n\nChurch Society vice president Alison Ruoff called the path\"brilliant\".\n\nThe gravestones are understood to all be more than 100 years old and a remembrance garden will be planted along the path.\n\nThe trust said the stones continued to be\"a target for anti-social behaviour\"despite being moved around the perimeter of the church in the 1960s.\n\nMs Ruoff said\"vandals are always up to something\"and she was pleased that the gravestones would now be\"used for something that can be made beautiful\".\n\nShe added:\"You can go to many churches and actually walk on people's gravestones in the aisle. You don't go leapfrogging around them, you just walk over them normally. \n\n\"They're there as a reminder of people who have lived their lives well or not in the past. Why should we worry about it? We get hung up on all sorts of strange things.\"\n\nBut a number of people commented about the\"disgraceful\"and\"disrespectful\"path on the BBC Three Counties Radio Facebook page.\n\nOne man said the path, which features poetry from young people, showed an\"astonishing lack of respect\".\n\nHe added:\"Grave error bearing in mind the villagers were not consulted and many are in uproar after only finding out about it yesterday.\"\n\nOthers were open to the idea, with one person calling it a\"great use of these semi-historic bits of stone\".\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe trust said it had\"sought professional advice regarding the best way forward\"for the stones, many of which were\"in danger of falling\".\n\n\"Churches regularly reuse old gravestones where the inscription is no longer visible, and we have followed best practice by recording which stones have been placed in each location,\"it said.\n\n\"The Poetry and Peace Path was seen to be the most appropriate and positive way of keeping and denoting respect for the flat stones without inscriptions.\"\nTL;DR: A church has been accused of making a \"grave error\" by using ancient tombstones as a footpath.\n\nArticle: Naheed Khan, 43 and from Thornaby, Teesside, disappeared over the 2018 May Bank Holiday weekend, last accessing her bank account on Sunday  6 May. \n\nPolice launched a murder investigation and have made five arrests but no-one has been charged.\n\nHer family and detectives have issued a fresh appeal for information. \n\nDespite searches of a number of areas, Ms Khan's body has not been found.\n\nA spokeswoman for the family said they just wanted her to be\"buried respectfully like she deserves\".\n\nShe said:\"There isn't a day that goes by where we don't think about where Naheed is or what has happened to her, the time that has passed hasn't made this any easier.\n\n\"We are begging with all of our hearts for someone to come forward anonymously and give us some closure so we can try and live with some peace of mind that we know where she is.\"\n\nDet Ch Insp Mark Dimelow said:\"We strongly believe people are still withholding vital information from us.\n\n\"We would urge anyone with information to please come forward, for the sake of Naheed's family, who have suffered tremendously throughout this ordeal.\"\n\nHer last known movements were in central Middlesbrough, around the university, Linthorpe Road and Newport, police said.\n\nDet Ch Insp Mark Dimelow said:\"All of these areas are extremely busy places and we believe the answers to her death lie within the Middlesbrough area.\"\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nCleveland Police\n\nCrimestoppers\nTL;DR: The family of a missing woman have said \"not a day goes by when they do not think about her\" on the second anniversary of her disappearance.\n\nArticle: The Belgian graffiti artist ROA is known for painting huge murals of animals on multi-storey buildings in large cities, like London, Berlin and Mexico City. But in the village of Galoya, in The Gambia's Kombo Central District, the scale of his work is much smaller. \n\nHe paints animals native to the location, like the meerkat, above, and pangolin, below. But that is almost all that is known about him. The person who invited him to The Gambia, Lawrence Williams, knows him simply as Peter.\n\n\"He is very secretive about his identity\"said Mr Williams.\n\nROA was one of many artists to come to Galoya and its neighbouring villages from 2011 for a project called Wide Open Walls.\n\nIt all started when Mr Williams, a lodge owner, met top Gambian artist Njogu Toure at a tourism industry event. Mr Williams, a UK national, had been looking for a way to get involved in the community around his lodge and to lure tourists away from the coast. \n\nThe two formed an artist collective called Bush Dwellers. Among their artworks was a Banksy-inspired stencil, below, featuring the girls of the village of Makumbaya.  \n\nAlthough Mr Williams had gone to art school, he said he\"had zero contacts in [the] street art world\". He sent an email to graffiti artist Eelus, known for his art painted in different shades of grey. \n\n\"Eelus brought over big names in the street art world, that opened a lot of doors,\"said Mr Williams.\n\nThe project saw graffiti artists from around the world stream in to these tiny villages, sometimes twice a year. British artist collaborative Best Ever, whose painting of a man lying sideways is featured below, returned to The Gambia around eight times. \n\nVillagers had the opportunity to contribute to the artworks. US-based artist Andrew Breitenberg quoted one of the village elders, who said:\"I work carefully to open my heart,\"after an afternoon discussion about what text should feature on top of Best Ever's painting.\n\nFor some artists, like the Israel-based American Addam Yekutieli, who goes by the pseudonym Know Hope, it was their first visit to an African country. \n\n\"We are painting on people's houses, which is different to a wall that is owned by a shopping mall or bank,\"Mr Yekutieli told the BBC.\n\nHis work would appear overnight in major cities, an element of surprise that was lost in Galoya. Villagers knew what he was doing from the first stroke of paint. Some even sat in front of his work, literally watching paint dry. \n\nHis painting of figures linking arms, below, is inspired by the village well, opposite it, which he saw as a meeting point for the community. \n\nA similarity of street art in big cities and paintings in a village like Galoya is that the works do not last very long.\n\nAt least five paintings I had seen posted on Instagram had disappeared by the time I visited. \n\nVillagers told me that was because many of the painted homes were made of mud, which crumbled in the rainy season. \n\n\"I think there is something metaphorically beautiful about that - honest about natural transformation\"Mr Yekutieli told the BBC.\n\nThis might not be the first thing on the mind of someone who had lost their home.\n\nMr Williams recognised the problem and started giving out cement to the villagers. In 2016, villagers gave Mr Williams some land to build a nursery. \n\nWhile villagers like the paintings, they also expressed frustration.\n\nSarjo Beyai, a 20-year-old woman pictured above, said that when tourists visit the zebra ROA painted on her house she cannot communicate with them because she does not speak English.\n\nAmadou Soule told me that apart from the odd tip from tourists, he was disappointed in not financially benefitting from ROA's painting of a giant elephant on the side of his house, pictured below. \n\n\"I was hoping for a sponsor for my teacher training,\"he said.\n\nAnd many villagers complained that the promise of a nursery had not materialised. \n\n\"There is a community fund that is set up, there is money in the bank that is just sitting there,\"Mr Williams, who left the country a year ago, said.\n\nHe had a car accident in East Timor where he\"almost died\"and has not been back to The Gambia since, he added.\n\nHe plans to start building the nursery in November, but says there is no timeframe for it.\n\nThe art has, nonetheless, made an impact.  \n\nBritish artist Remy Rough is known for painting bold colours and geometric shapes across grand expanses.\n\nVillagers watched his technique - using masking tape - and started copying it across walls and whole buildings. \n\nThis is one of many walls created, not by foreign artists, but by people who live in Galoya village:\n\nAll photographs and interviews by Clare Spencer.\nTL;DR: In a bid to lure tourists, internationally-renowned graffiti artists were invited to create artworks in a village in The Gambia, writes the BBC's Clare Spencer. \n\n\n\nArticle: Last month the United Nations warned that funds for this part of Sri Lanka had sharply declined. \n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Colombo the leader of the Tamil National Alliance, R. Sampanthan, painted a picture of devastation\n                  after he led a party delegation visiting the north, where fighting ended a year ago.\n               \n\n\nHe believed more than 200,000 displaced Tamil civilians had now returned to their villages but said more than 80% of their\n                  former houses were destroyed or damaged beyond repair.

Urging potential\n                  donors to send more money to the north, he said that the situation was still an emergency and that there was much to be done\n                  for their needs in farming, livelihoods such as fishing, and so on.\n               \n\nThe United Nations' Sri Lanka mission is now having to dig into emergency funds because of a serious shortfall in donor money.\n                  \n               \n\nThese Tamil politicians, whose party used to be a proxy of the Tamil Tigers, are urging the government to release all detained\n                  former Tiger combatants immediately unless there's serious evidence against them.But a senior military official told the BBC that the government will continue what it calls rehabilitation programmes for\n                  them, and that for some, this process will last up to two years; they say 2,000 have already been released.\nTL;DR: The Tamil National Alliance (TNA ) has appealed to donors not to forget the situation in the north of the island, where some\n                     60,000 displaced people remain in camps and many more are trying to resettle in devastated villages.\n\nArticle: By Hazel ShearingBBC News\n\nFrom cutting down on\"plant miles\"to reusing plastic pots, British gardeners, botanists and environmental campaigners have shared ways to keep your horticultural hobby sustainable.\n\nHouseplants are on the rise, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says average sales in the second half of last year were up 60% on the previous year. \n\nThe trend has been attributed to eco-friendly, health-conscious millennials who want to bring the great outdoors into their inner-city flats and nurture something\"real\"in an increasingly virtual world.\n\nAbout four in five 16 to 24-year-olds own at least one houseplant and a fifth of owners bought them to boost their health and wellbeing, a RHS survey suggests.\n\nIf they can get some good photos along the way, even better. The hashtag #plantsofinstagram has been used more than 4 million times.  \n\nPlant miles\n\nWith the craze has sprung up a number of specialist online retailers that deliver straight to your door.\n\nPatch, which says it is London's biggest online plant retailer, is one example. It gives its plants nicknames like\"Chaz\"and\"Big Ken\"to endear them to prospective\"plant parents\".\n\nChief executive Freddie Blackett says that part of the appeal is that plants make people feel\"calmer, happier and more at ease\".\n\nPatch's plants are grown in the Netherlands and shipped to the UK as and when they are ordered, which avoids excess plants being shipped.\n\nBut ordering online could rack up\"plant miles\", says Fay Kenworthy, co-founder of PlantSwap, a Sheffield-based community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally.\n\n\"As many plants are brought in from overseas, their transportation represents a significant ecological footprint,\"she says, noting that while most come from Holland, orchids can be shipped from Indonesia and\"light-loving\"plants from Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\n\"You may have decided to reduce your international travel to protect the environment but your plants are still shipping across the world.\"\n\nShipping from abroad isn't too much of a concern for botanist and BBC presenter James Wong, the proud owner of 500 houseplants.\n\n\"You're going to be [ordering plants] on a much smaller scale compared to outdoors, so, by definition, it's going to have a lower carbon footprint,\"he says.\n\nHe argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car, and that many UK buyers live closer to Amsterdam than British-based suppliers.\n\nHe adds that growing certain plants in hotter climates and shipping them to the UK can eliminate the need for heated greenhouses closer to home. \n\nHowever, Wong agrees that exchanging unwanted plants, cuttings, and seedlings at plant swaps is a sustainable option for houseplant buyers.\n\nAnother benefit, according to Ms Kenworthy, is that it avoids the excess packaging that comes with new plants - including plastic pots.\n\nPlastic pots\n\nPots can be a\"nightmare\"to recycle, says anti-plastic campaigner Amy Meek, 16.\n\nOnly about 10% of local authorities in the UK accept them, according to analysts at the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). \n\nSometimes they are not collected because they are considered contaminated. But many are also made from black plastic, which often cannot be detected by sorting machines at recycling centres, and so end up in landfill or incinerated.\n\nMany local authorities reject even non-black plastic pots, which has led to the development of more easily-recyclable taupe pots and even biodegradable pots.\n\nThe Horticultural Trades Association and RHS Gardens offer plant pot recycling or\"take back\"schemes, and B&Q says it is trialling a recycling scheme.\n\nMiss Meek, who runs environmental charity Kids Against Plastic with her younger sister, Ella, wants buyers to think about plants' packaging.\n\nShe encourages people to ask:\"Will I be able to  I use it again, or is there somewhere else I could look to buy these plants from that are using more sustainable packaging or one that could be used for longer?\"\n\nFor peat's sake\n\nBut being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered  - it is also about what it is grown in. \n\nThe main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts. \n\nThe earthy substance, found in waterlogged areas in the UK, is made of decomposed plant matter and can take thousands of years to form. \n\n\"Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year,\"says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife.\n\nHe encourages people to check with retailers about the use of peat, or to stick to plants that don't need it, like orchids or cacti.\n\nBut hang on, don't houseplants clean the air?\n\nBecause plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air.\n\nPhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove\"significant amounts\"of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil.\n\n\"The amount the plant is watered affects its ability to function and remove CO2, in the same way as with people - if you're dehydrated or have drunk too much water you will not function as well,\"he says.\n\nDracaena\"Golden Coast\"plants and peace lillies performed best in his research, but he says you'd still need to buy a lot of them - even installing a vertical garden or\"green wall\"- and have extra lighting in order for them to reduce CO2 levels.\n\nSo, are houseplants bad for the environment?\n\nWong says that everything we do has a carbon footprint and that, in the scheme of things, people shouldn't\"freak out\"about their environmental impact.\n\nHowever, he advises that if buyers want to be as sustainable as possible, they should talk to their suppliers about the use of peat, avoid buying houseplants that are\"designed to die\"like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti, and propagate plants from cuttings and seeds to offset any environmental concerns.\n\n\"Not that those things are a huge issue,\"he says.\"But every little bit helps.\"\nTL;DR: Cultivating an indoor plant is thought to have positive effects on mental health and wellbeing, and a snap of a succulent is a sure way to get some Instagram likes.

We don't know yet whether there will be full bodies in this chamber, or nearby chambers. \n\n\"The number of finds from a single fossil locality is unprecedented. There are apparently three small babies and three small children, some older children as well as some adults.\"\n\nNHM visitors will get to see a model of a skull. There are also examples of a hand, a foot, and some jaws.\n\nThey are all small because, even as adults, naledi is diminutive, perhaps standing no taller than about 1.5m (5ft). \n\nWits University has previously shared casts of other fossils it is working on, including those of a more ancient creature called Australopithecus sediba, which was also found in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site in Gauteng province. These too will be available on Friday to compare and contrast.\n\nDeep debate\n\nThere are probably two major unanswered questions surrounding H. naledi at the moment.\n\nOne concerns the age of the fossils. If any dating technique has been used to try to establish this, the results have not been released. \n\nCurrently, it is being assumed they are very ancient - maybe a couple of million years old - purely on the basis that some features seen in the bones look very primitive.\n\nThe second major question centres on what the remains were doing in the Rising Star cave complex.\n\nThe Wits team has mooted the possibility that naledi may have disposed of its dead there deliberately. That is a remarkable proposition if the creature is as old as has been suggested.\n\nBut it is perplexing to think how so many individuals could navigate their way into such a deep cave.  \n\nThe scientists found the remains in an opening at the bottom of a very narrow chute. But even to get to the chute, the researchers had to crawl through other narrow gaps and make some steep climbs.\n\nHow naledi managed this is inexplicable. It is unlikely this creature had access to torches; controlled use of fire came much later in history.\n\nAlready, some furious arguments have surfaced over the interpretations put forward by the Wits team. \n\nRival researchers have even questioned whether the fossil haul actually represents two or more different species, or just a slightly different version of a species we have seen before.\n\n\"Not everyone is going to agree with Lee Berger's team. But all credit to them - they've put the material out,\"commented Prof Chris Stringer from the NHM. \n\n\"If you don't like their interpretation of the fossils, you can download the files and print your own.

The titans of the American tech world are not travelling to Asia with Team Trump. Instead Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Apple's Tim Cook and Microsoft's Satya Nadella stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing with President Xi last week for a group photograph of the advisory board for a top Chinese university. \n\nThe asymmetry in public deference extends to the individuals themselves. Mr Trump has said repeatedly how much he respects Mr Xi  and his\"extraordinary elevation\", describing him as a powerful man and a good friend. Former chief strategist Stephen Bannon has said\"there is no leader Trump admires more\". But in public, Mr Xi has never called Mr Trump a great anything, let alone a great friend. \n\nMr Xi claims to have read many American authors from Walt Whitman to Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway but he has not listed Donald Trump among them. The real estate man's Art of the Deal may have been a business bestseller in America but a more reliable guide to Mr Xi's statecraft is Sun Zi's Art of War. \n\nMr Trump advises,\"You can't be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you've got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.\"\n\nBut the ancient military text, required reading for all Chinese strategists, urges,\"Know the enemy, know yourself and your victory will never be endangered. Know the ground, know the weather and your victory will then be total.\"\n\nThe contrast between Mr Xi and Mr Trump stretches back across a lifetime. After a cosseted early childhood as the\"red princeling\"son of a revered revolutionary, Mr Xi spent seven years as a farmer living in a cave before embarking on a four-decade climb through China's political hierarchy. \n\nTo reach the pinnacle of the 89-million strong Chinese Communist Party is a feat which requires iron discipline and strategic patience. Neither quality is often mentioned in character sketches of Donald Trump. \n\nUnsurprisingly there are style differences too. Mr Xi rarely starts a sentence with the word\"I\", wrapping his leadership instead in the dignity of the national flag. He aims to embody something sacred, the dream of\"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\". For this he must appear at all times sober, steady, invincible. \n\nTo the extent that he has a personality cult, it is exacted from others. Schools, universities, company board rooms and government offices across China are now embarking on the study of\"Xi Jinping Thought\". \n\nBy contrast, Mr Trump's personality cult starts with Mr Trump and the first person pronoun\"I\"is rarely off his lips. As he tours Asia, he leaves behind an America mired in what Chinese state media gloatingly describe as\"crisis and chaos\". \n\nAn odd couple\n\nBut for all the contrasts, the career communist and the property magnate do have two things in common. They both exercise enormous power and they both have great self-belief. Mr Xi and Mr Trump view themselves as the saviours of their countries and each views his country as exceptional in the world. Xi Jinping's\"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\"came before Donald Trump's\"make America great again\". \n\nBut the promise is the same: to rediscover a golden age of great power supremacy and allow no outside interest to stand in its way. \n\nAs Mr Xi and Mr Trump share the world stage this week in the pageantry of what China describes as a\"state visit plus\", the big question will be whether they can find a way for their countries to be great together or whether this has to be a zero sum game where the greatness of one demands the diminution of the other. \n\nOf course this is not just a question for this week's odd couple but a question for our lifetimes. With the benefit of hindsight we may look back on Mr Trump's Asia tour and see it as the recalibration of deep and staying American power or as a milestone towards US displacement by China. \n\nPerhaps history will place the visit in neither of these momentous narratives but instead frame the week as the last quaint ritual of a vanished world, the arranging of deck chairs on the Titanic, the calm before a storm. \n\nReined in\n\nLet's take these scenarios in turn. On the eve of Mr Trump's tour, his administration suddenly started using a new strategic slogan, talking of\"a free and open Indo-Pacific\". Until this rabbit from a hat is sketched out more fully, it is hard to know exactly how it differs from the vision of previous US administrations. \n\nBut the purpose must be to reassure allies and friends and shore up American credibility after Mr Trump's criticisms over trade deficits and defence spending, and his abandonment of the Obama administration's TPP trade deal for the region. \n\nThe message is that Mr Trump's senior staff, the so-called adults in the room, have reined in the president's disruptive instincts and restored US policy in Asia to its former compass setting. If a\"free and open Indo-Pacific\"turns into more than a slogan, history may describe this tour as the moment when a still vigorous US superpower reinforced the economic and security ties that bind it to Asia, with allies and friends gratefully uniting behind it for protection against a prickly and assertive China. \n\nIn the second version of history, Mr Trump's Asia tour is a point of intersection in the arc of China's rise and the arc of America's decline. For all his unfailing politeness to his guest, this is the version of history which Xi Jinping is attempting to write. He intends a coherent strategic push between now and mid-century building on growing hard and soft power. \n\nMr Trump may be focused on Asia this week, but every other week he is consumed by problems at home, while China shows up in the region daily. With immense energy and purpose, it pours money into regional development, diplomacy, military ties and media, mounting a calculated charm offensive even in countries which have been American allies for seven decades. \n\nAll of Asia can see that Mr Xi has just emerged from a Communist Party Congress with his power dramatically enhanced, and on the surface at least, China shows none of the division and incoherence of the US.\n\nWinning weapons\n\nBut no American president could willingly play the part allotted him in this narrative. Which is where the third scenario of the vanishing world comes in. On the campaign trail last year Mr Trump raged about China's\"rape\"of the American economy and\"theft of American jobs\". He promised that if elected, he would succeed where predecessors failed\u2026\"cunning\"Chinese leaders would no longer\"out-smart, out-manoeuvre and out-negotiate\"American ones. \n\nThe frustration was echoed across American political and business elites where many felt China was winning the superpower race on a rigged running track.\n\nBut every new US president of the 21st Century has said he intends to rise to the strategic challenge of China only to be knocked off course by events. For George W Bush it was 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. For Barack Obama, the pivot to Asia took second place to financial crisis at home and Middle East crisis abroad. \n\nThe China of 2017 is much stronger and more confident than that of 2001 or 2009. And under Mr Xi it is committed to a war of values against American ideals of freedom and democracy. \n\nLast week, Mr Xi led his top team, fists clenched, in a ritualised oath of allegiance to the Communist Party flag. While for all Donald Trump's symbolism of a long Asian tour and fine words about a\"free and open Indo-Pacific\", this US president has only just put in place a China team much less a strategy. \n\nIn fact since taking office, Chinese leaders have been relieved to see Trump's China trolling stay on Twitter. He has issued warnings over Beijing's trade with North Korea and launched an investigation of Chinese trade practices with the US, but he has imposed no sanctions against the massive asymmetries that defeat US aspirations in China. \n\nThis may change in the months ahead. If the US were to move from grumbling co-operation with China to more robust competition, the consequences for Asia and for the world would be as unpredictable as they would be momentous. \n\nMr Xi is determined to avoid that. He needs a stable world and stable American export market to complete his rejuvenation of China. In Beijing this week, he will try to disarm Mr Trump. \n\nFlattering photo opportunities are what China does best and they are a great deal cheaper than opening key markets or throttling the North Korean economy. So the host will play to his guest's love of pomp by putting on a lavish spectacle. \n\nHe will encourage Mr Trump to imagine that this is a chapter in the Art of the Deal rather than the Art of War.\n\nAfter all, as Sun Zi pointed out in his ancient book of warcraft, deception, diplomacy and divide-and-rule are all winning weapons for a great commander. \n\n\"The supreme excellence is to subdue the armies of your enemies without having to fight them.\"\nTL;DR: Donald Trump is the kind of person who occasionally gets locked up in Xi Jinping's China. A boastful billionaire, someone who thinks he is bigger than the Party, bigger than the national project.\n\nArticle: Morgan Johansson said scenes in Calais had resulted from France and the UK not taking\"responsibility\"for accepting more asylum seekers.\n\nMigrants in Calais are making nightly bids to cross the Channel.\n\nThe UK and French governments have announced they will bolster security around the Eurotunnel site in Calais.\n\nThousands of migrants have attempted to access the Eurotunnel terminal in the last week, and nine have died trying to access the tunnel since the start of June. \n\nDavid Cameron has said the UK will not become a\"safe haven\"for migrants and warned illegal immigrants would be removed from the country. \n\n'Divide people'\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme, Mr Johansson criticised Mr Cameron for using the word\"illegal\"about asylum seekers before they have been through the asylum process, and said they were seeking a basic human right.\n\nSweden allows anyone from Syria into the country, and last year Sweden accepted 30,000 asylum seekers compared to the UK's 10,000.\n\nMr Johansson called on the rest of the European Union, including the UK, to take more people in.\n\n\"I hear what he [Mr Cameron] is saying about illegal immigrants and about swarms and everything like that,\"he said.\n\n\"I think he's playing on strings - that he wants to actually divide people - and that's not a constructive way.\"\n\n'Tunnel run'\n\nBy BBC Europe reporter Gavin Lee in Calais\n\n\"It's gone midnight, we need more people, you need to come,\"says Mohammed, a Sudanese migrant standing by a metal fence that separates him from the railway line at the Channel tunnel freight terminal. \n\nPreparing for the next\"tunnel run\", he is on his mobile, urging his cousin Tayeb to join him and the 200 other migrants who have broken through two layers of fencing already. \n\nOn the other side stand 20 riot police, waiting with tear gas. \n\nMohammed's plea is a telling indication of the wider split in the camp, between those who continue to risk their lives on the relentless quest to illegally stow away to the UK, and those who are exhausted, injured, or deterred by the increased security.\n\nThis weekend has been relatively calm, although French police have decided to stop releasing daily estimates of how many migrants are managing to break into the train terminal. \n\nThe fear is the continuous daily updates on security lapses only serve to fuel media reports and intensify the situation.\n\n\n                  Calais migrant crisis                \n\n\n                      Impact on Kent council social services                    \n\n629\n\nthe number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum that require care from Kent county council\n\n220 the equivalent number in March 2014 \n\n\u00a35.5m funding shortfall according to the council \n\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve urged other EU nations to help address the root causes of the\"global migration crisis\". \n\nA raft of additional security measures planned for the French end of the Channel Tunnel, such as more CCTV surveillance, French police reinforcements and extra fencing, were agreed between Mr Cameron and French President Francois Hollande on Friday.\n\nThere have been significant delays in and around Kent and to cross-Channel services as a result of the situation in Calais. \n\nImmigration minister James Brokenshire earlier said rules could be changed to remove taxpayer support for more than 10,000 failed asylum-seekers living in the UK with their families.\n\nMr Brokenshire said he wanted to\"send out a very clear message to those who seek to exploit the system that Britain is not a soft touch on asylum\".\n\nBut charity The Refugee Council said it would be\"morally reprehensible\"to withdraw financial support \"from some of the most vulnerable families in the UK, many of whom fear there is real risk of serious harm or persecution to them and their children if returned to their countries of origin\".\n\nShadow immigration minister David Hanson said the government needed to put diplomatic pressure on the French government to assess migrants in Calais to determine if they had proper asylum seeker or refugee status or were in the country illegally. \n\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron urged the government to treat asylum seekers\"humanely\", adding that the situation in Calais was\"the tip of a humanitarian crisis\".  \n\nUKIP MEP Mike Hookem criticised French and EU authorities, saying they had\"totally lost control\".\n\nHe added:\"They are not interested in dealing with this at source and the British government's response in totally inadequate. \n\n\"Calais is like a balloon being squeezed.

It runs Solihull, Birmingham Heartlands and the Queen Elizabeth Hospitals, along with Sutton Coldfield's Good Hope.\n\nThe NEC is in Solihull borough and sits on the border with Birmingham.\n\nBetween Monday and the end of July, bosses hope clinics at the leisure venue will see up to 150 patients per day, covering 18 services including ultrasound diagnostics and anticoagulation. UHB will also run an appointment-only, drive-through phlebotomy service.\n\nStaff will move with their clinics, says UHB.\n\nParking is free at the NEC campus which\"repurposes\"a pre-existing facility set up by Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). \n\nThe CCG says for Solihull patients, the campus offers a solution to accessing urgent primary care that can no longer be delivered at Solihull Hospital, which is a designated\"clean site\".\n\nThe CCG says while people can still access their own GP as usual, the campus allows\"drive-through, pre-booked GP urgent care for almost half of Solihull's population\".\n\nNone of the provisions are connected to the NEC's nightingale hospital, which, a UHB spokesperson says,\"remains on standby to provide extra inpatient capacity for hospitals across the Midlands should it be needed\".\n\nThe trust says the campus affords a larger waiting area which in turn means medics can have more face-to-face appointments while still observing safety measures.\n\n\"Repurposing part of this facility will enable the trust to treat patients who we would otherwise not be able to see immediately on our hospital sites due to restricted clinics to accommodate social distancing and reduce footfall,\"a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The initiative will support the trust in working through the backlog of patients whose appointments were cancelled during the peak of the pandemic.\"\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

judged by the National Piers Society (NPS), with Llandudno pier taking third place.\n\nThe 145-year-old structure was hit by a devastating fire in 2010 but it reopened last year following a \u00a314.2m restoration project.\n\nGavin Henderson, NPS president, said the pier was\"truly a phoenix\".\n\nMaria Ludkin, chair of Hastings Pier Trustees, said:\"We are absolutely delighted that our wonderful community-owned pier has won this prestigious award.\"\n\nThe pier, built by engineer Eugenius Birch, was prosperous during the mid-20th Century but it went into decline as holidaymakers travelled further afield.\n\nIt was closed for safety reasons in 2006 because it had fallen into disrepair, before fire tore through the structure four years later.\n\nWork to redevelop it began after the council compulsorily purchased it from its owners in 2012.\n\nThe redevelopment took more than two years and saw the pier's former pavilion turned into a restaurant and bar.\n\nThe structure is now owned by the Hastings Pier Charity and 3,000 shareholders who bought into the project at \u00a3100 a share.\n\nHastings Pier's'golden age'\n\nBuilt in 1872, the pier was\"the first true pleasure pier, devoted to entertainment\", according to the National Piers Society.\n\nIn the 19th Century, it featured an Oriental-style pavilion, appearances by leading music hall stars, open air dancing and a shooting range.\n\nThe 1930s saw new buildings added including a camera obscura.\n\nTaken over by the Army in the 1940s, the pier had a 75ft section removed to prevent enemy landings during World War Two.\n\nIn the 1960s, the ballroom saw performances by The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Jimi Hendrix Experience.\nTL;DR: A 19th Century pier that was almost destroyed by fire has been voted Pier of the Year.\n\nArticle: Locals will have limits set on the size of their farms under the proposals.\n\nMr Zuma first announced them in a state of the nation speech on Thursday overshadowed by violence in parliament.\n\nTwo decades after the end of apartheid, land is still concentrated in the hands of a largely white minority, and remains a sensitive issue. \n\nThe government is under growing pressure to put more land in the hands of the country's black majority.\n\n\"Land has become one of the most critical factors in achieving redress for the wrongs of the past,\"said Mr Zuma, elaborating on the plans on Saturday.\n\n\"In this regard, the regulation of land holdings bill will be submitted to parliament this year.\"\n\nIn the future, foreigners will only be allowed to lease land, not to own it, he said, adding that local farmers would not be able to own more than 12,000 hectares.\n\nThat is presumably aimed at white farmers who still own much of the best farmland a generation after the end of racial apartheid, says the BBC's Andrew Harding in Johannesburg.\n\nThere are many reasons for the slow pace of change in the country, says our correspondent, and these new proposals will face strong legal challenges from farmers who argue that smaller plots will not be commercially viable.\n\nBut the governing African National Congress is looking for votes, and is wary of being outflanked by more radical voices calling for white-owned land to be seized without compensation, he adds.\n\nParliamentary brawl \n\nOn Thursday, parliament descended into chaos as leftist MPs scuffled with security during Mr Zuma's key annual speech.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema, repeatedly interrupted Mr Zuma, demanding answers over a spending scandal.\n\nThe speaker of parliament then ordered their removal, prompting scuffles.\n\nThe EFF used President Zuma's annual State of the Nation speech to question him about a state-funded, multi-million dollar upgrade to his private residence.\n\nThe party has shaken up South African politics with a series of populist proposals to redistribute wealth.\nTL;DR: Foreigners will be banned

publicly or face a $90m (\u00a370m) lawsuit.\n\nBangladesh will hold a general election next month, with Prime Minister Hasina and her Awami League hoping to retain power.\n\nMr Chowdhury, a former general secretary of the Bangladesh Awami British Law Students Union, is not acting officially on behalf of the party.\n\nHis lawyer, Nawroz Chowdhury, said his aim had been to have the error corrected as soon as possible.\n\nThe legal notice sent to the cinema at the Jamuna Future Park shopping mall describes him as a\"diehard supporter\"of Ms Hasina while the film itself is repeatedly referred to as\"legendary\".\n\nThe topic is trending on social media, where opinion is split.\n\n\"How should I react - laugh or cry? Tale becomes tail which is definitely defamatory,\"said Facebook user Mokbul Hossain.\n\n\"It's just a typo, bro. Apparently, you are using cannons to fight mosquitoes,\"commented Facebook user Shaqlain Shayon.\n\nThe biopic about Ms Hasina - daughter of Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - has been described by the Dhaka Tribune newspaper as a docudrama and features Ms Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana as narrator.\n\nAfter its premiere in Dhaka, Finance Minister Abul Muhith told the newspaper it was\"amazing\"and\"timeless\"and he had\"learned a lot of new things from it\".\nTL;DR: A supporter of Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina threatened to sue a cinema over a spelling error that inadvertently suggested she had a \"tail\".\n\nArticle: It owns 90% of Banesto and will buy out the minority shareholders with Santander shares at a 25% premium.

You should have seen the look on their faces. I had to say to them,'This is not acting, that's real people.' \n\n\"They had studied World War One in Year 9 so they had the context to the conflict but this was real life, the war brought to life through the voices, the faces, the camaraderie, even details like the latrines.\"\n\nMr Rogers, who's English, teaches history at an international school in northern Spain. The reaction of his students was as varied as their nationalities.\n\nBlanco Gros Pereira, who's Spanish, expressed surprise that young men were\"willing to lie about their age to get in - kids of 14.

I can keep them safely in my shed, away from mice.\"\n\nWhen the time is right, the gutter makes the right shape so he can slide the plants into a furrow in the ground.\n\nStuart has also been growing basil, parsley, swedes, brussels sprouts and cabbage on top of his fridge, where it is warm.\n\nHe has combined this with a grow lamp which provides light to start the plants germinating earlier. He then plans to plant them outside his house, where he can keep an eye on them regardless of any further restrictions.\n\nSeona Robinson, who has a plot at Inverleith Allotments in Edinburgh, said she cried when she discovered mice had eaten all her seeds - and she has been unable to buy any more due to the lockdown.\n\nShe said:\"I'm very organised and only grow what I need, so when this happened I had no more seeds.

while Intensive Care Society guidelines suggest a maximum of 70%.\n\nOccupancy levels higher than this can lead to cancelled operations and delayed admissions to hospital.\n\nThe report also said with an ageing population,\"demand for critical care services will outstrip current supply levels\".\n\n'Uncertainty'\n\nIt added serious staff shortages means\"the current workforce is beginning to experience added stresses and uncertainty\".\n\nThe report noted that according to the latest workforce survey, 50% of Welsh critical care units do not meet professional standards for consultant staffing and 80% do not meet all the standards for junior staffing.\n\nThe Welsh Government, according to the report, expects health boards in the next 12 months to develop\"a clear plan\"to address the shortfall.\n\nThe report also warned of too many delays in discharging patients from critical care units, with two thirds (66%) of all critical care patients delayed for more than four hours, affecting almost 4,000 patients.\n\nIt is as a result of\"problems with whole hospital flow - with hospitals running at maximum capacity with no spare ward beds\", the report added.\n\nThe Welsh Government wants 95% of patients discharged within four hours.\n\nLast December the Royal College of Surgeons expressed concerns that many scheduled operations including major ones were having to be postponed at the last minute because of a shortage of intensive care beds. \n\nHowever, in terms of death rates, the report said it was\"encouraging\"that almost all sites are in line with what would be expected at most units.\n\nSurvival rates\n\nBut there is some concern that death rates at Wales' biggest hospital - University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff - are slightly higher than expected.\n\nThe Welsh Government said Cardiff and Vale Health Board is\"expected to take action to ensure they return to within control limits as soon as possible\".\n\nHealth Secretary Vaughan Gething said:\"We know there are areas where care is improving - crucially, we have seen an increase in survival rates and reductions in the numbers of patients who are re-admitted to critical care soon after leaving it.\n\n\"This report demonstrates our commitment to transparency and also sets out where the NHS needs to improve so that we can make sure people have access to excellent critical cares across Wales.\"\n\nDr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of NHS Wales said the flow of patients through hospitals and into the community is key to success.\n\nHe added:\"This can only be resolved by health boards adopting a whole hospital approach to critical care. \n\n\"We will continue to work with them closely and take account of both these reports during the refresh of our delivery plans in Wales.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said the  report\"flags some serious issues which are significantly hampering the NHS' ability to deliver the appropriate level of care to some of its most vulnerable patients\".\nTL;DR: Hospital departments that treat the most seriously ill patients are too full and seriously understaffed, a Welsh Government report has said.\n\nArticle: The statement follows a meeting of Scotland's strategy secretary and the UK Armed Forces minister.\n\nBruce Crawford MSP said he secured agreement from Nick Harvey that Scotland would see a rise in the number of military personnel based here.\n\nHowever, he said there was no guarantees over Scottish regiments.\n\nMr Crawford said he gained assurance that for the bases at Leuchars and Kinloss, which are transferring from RAF to Army use, transition plans would take account of the impact on the local economy and local public services.\n\nHe said:\"While the minister could not provide certainty on the timescales for MoD decisions, which remains a key concern for the communities affected in Scotland, I welcome that he did recognise that account must be taken in any transition proposals, of the impact on the local economy and public services.\n\n\"Worryingly, in the first three months of this year, official MoD figures show that the number of MoD personnel posted in Scotland has fallen by 660.\n\n\"However, I was pleased to secure agreement from the minister that there will be an increase in the number of military personnel in Scotland and that Scotland will still become home to a multi-role brigade.\"\n\n'Regimental traditions'\n\nMr Crawford said he would continue to press the UK government on their specific commitment of last year to increase military personnel in Scotland by 2000.\n\nUK ministers announced in July last year that the RAF Leuchars base would close and become a new Army headquarters. The government said this would mean an increased military\"footprint\"in Scotland.\n\nMr Crawford also discussed the issue of regiments with Mr Harvey.\n\nHe said:\"I am very disappointed that the MoD and the Armed Forces minister were today unable to guarantee the future of our traditional Scottish regimental units.\n\n\"The Scottish government understands the importance of Scotland's historic regimental traditions and we have repeatedly called on the UK government to respect those traditions as it takes forward its plans for Army restructuring.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said there were no plans to strip away regimental cap badges.\n\nShe added:\"A regular Army of 82,000 plus 30,000 reserves will have a different structure to one of 102,000, and some units will inevitably be lost or will merge.\n\n\"The traditions and heritage of the Army's regimental system are hugely respected, and the defence secretary has been clear that this is fundamental to British Army fighting power.\n\n\"We are not going to change that.

They have a good aroma and feel kind of Christmassy,\"says Rory.\n\nHe likes the fact Iceland is catering to niche tastes and would potentially buy the crisps, although another shopper Martin is unconvinced. \n\n\"It tastes a little bit earthy, like dirt I guess. It's pretty unpleasant,\"he says.\"To me it stands out as a bit of a gimmick, it's just cashing in ahead of Christmas.\" \n\nOther experimental Christmas foods on sale in recent seasons have included Brussels sprouts-flavoured tea (containing granulated sprouts) from Sainsbury's, Christmas pudding smoothies from M&S and turkey breast-infused gin from Portobello Road Gin.\n\nRestaurants and caf\u00e9 chains are getting in on the act too, with Costa Coffee selling pigs in blankets mac and cheese, and Pizza Express offering a pizza complete with turkey, festive stuffing and rosemary.\n\nAnalysts say these novel creations help operators to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive climate. Market research firm Mintel says only 7% of grocery shoppers stick with one retailer in a single month and they are increasingly likely to spread their spending across brands.\n\n\"There's no doubt there's a marketing angle to this but consumers also love new products and it creates interest and excitement,\"says Mintel senior retail analyst Nicholas Carroll.\n\n\"It is hard to say whether [the more experimental creations] sell well, but the trend has been accelerating so there has to be demand.\"\n\nFestive fusion creations on sale this year\n\nOperators say the sales of some Christmas inventions have been strong reflecting consumer demand for more experimental flavours alongside traditional Christmas classics. \n\nBut they don't always get it right and often pull creations or change them following feedback, one example being Asda's Christmas dinner pizza. \n\n\"This year, we've listened to customer and colleague feedback and have ditched the sprouts in favour of pigs in blankets and stuffing balls, and it's already proving very popular,\"says Linsey Taylor, senior director of new product development at Asda.\n\nCarol Raithatha, a sensory science expert, says retailers will often work with consumers to find concepts that work before developing them. These might build on classic flavour combinations like sweet and sour or current food trends such as veganism or Mexican cuisine. \n\n\"Once the concept is there, you can use trained assessors to understand the sensory profiles of the foods you want to combine or create,\"she says. \n\n\"It is then about pulling out the key flavours that define a food or idea rather than making wholesale extracts.\"\n\nSainsbury's, for instance, is selling a pigs-in-blankets tea this year but it contains no meat, instead blending Lapsang Souchong tea with sage and rosemary, two ingredients commonly found in British sausages. \n\nOther recipes are more literal interpretations though, such as M&S's Brussemole, launched in 2015, which used sprouts instead of avocado in its take on the famous Mexican dip.  \n\nSome experts say the fad for festive-flavoured food may already be passing, however, and there are signs retailers are pulling back. M&S, for example, says it will focus more on classic dishes this year and less on\"weird and wacky flavours\", while restricting quirkier fare to its Christmas party range. \n\n\"You can only take it so far,\"says Robbie Bargh, the founder of Gorgeous Group, which advises restaurants and hotel groups such as Radisson on food. \n\n\"If I saw Christmas-themed sushi I would be put off, a Christmas dinner pizza doesn't sound quite right either.\"\n\nHe says it is nice for caf\u00e9s and restaurants to give a nod to Christmas but operators should focus on flavours rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. \n\n\"Ingredients like cinnamon and nutmeg provide nice Christmas touches to coffees and chai teas, while classic Christmas dinner sandwiches work well. It's when people jump on the bandwagon that it's a problem.\"\n\nHowever, he says he did try an excellent mince pie-flavoured ice cream recently, admitting:\"Most of it is marketing but occasionally you find something amazing.\"\nTL;DR: Many readers will find the thought of Christmas tree-flavoured crisps revolting, but Iceland is betting its customers will feel the opposite this festive season.\n\nArticle: \"I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas,\"said Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers.\n\nBut he pointed out that the US saw\"record numbers\"of cases and deaths after the Thanksgiving holiday - and said the NHS was worried about January.\n\nThe government's Dominic Raab said people needed the five-day relaxation of Covid rules on\"an emotional level\".\n\nMeanwhile, the chances of the Oxford University vaccine being rolled out by the end of the year are\"pretty high\", the vaccine's architect Prof Sarah Gilbert has told the BBC.\n\nA further 18,447 cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with another 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. \n\nThe number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. \n\nBetween 23 and 27 December, coronavirus restrictions are being relaxed across the UK, allowing three households to form a\"bubble\"and mix indoors and stay overnight.\n\nBut NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - has written to the PM urging him to\"personally lead a better public debate about the risks inherent in the guidance\"- although it stopped short of calling for a review of the rules over Christmas.\n\n\"There seems to be a sense at the moment that,'hey because the government's put these rules down, there's no risk to people having more social contact over Christmas',\"Mr Hopson told BBC Breakfast.\n\n\"Of course, part of it is about sticking to the rules but any kind of extra social contact over Christmas - particularly with those who are vulnerable to the virus - actually is very risky.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas, I really don't, but I think everybody needs to think really, really carefully what are they going to do over Christmas,\"he said.\n\n\"It's not,'is what we're going to be doing sticking within the rules?' It's'how much risk are we going to cause to the people we interact with?'\"\n\nThe rise in infections in the US after the Thanksgiving holiday was also highlighted by NHS Providers.\n\nThe NHS is worried about the potential pressure on hospital beds, and its ability to treat all the patients it needs to in December, January and February, Mr Hopson said.\n\n\"At the same time you've got rising infections in places like London, Essex, parts of Kent, parts of Lincolnshire,\"he added.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out any possibility that the government would review the Christmas relaxation of rules.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News's Sophy Ridge programme on Sunday, he said:\"I think people do need that five-day window over Christmas to spend a bit of time with their loved ones and I think at a mental health level, an emotional level, people do need it.\"\n\nIt comes after public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said loosening Covid restrictions over Christmas was\"a mistake\".\n\nWales' health minister Vaughan Gething said the rules around Christmas could be changed - but it could affect trust in the government.\n\n'Third wave risk'\n\nNHS Providers also warned that relaxing Covid rules when they are reviewed in England could trigger a third wave of the virus during the busiest time of year for hospitals.\n\nEngland's three-tier system is due to be reviewed on Wednesday 16 December. \n\nIt urged the PM against moving any area to a lower tier and said areas should be moved into tier three - the highest level of restrictions - \"as soon as this is needed, without any delay\". \n\nEarlier this week, some health experts called for London to be placed in tier three\"now\"after official figures showed Outer London had a higher infection rate than some areas already in the top tier.\n\nThe government said it\"will not hesitate to take necessary actions to protect local communities\". \n\nDecisions on tiers are made by ministers, based on the latest available data and advice from public health experts, a spokesperson added. \n\n\"We have introduced strengthened local restrictions to protect the progress gained during national restrictions, reduce pressure on the NHS and ultimately save lives,\"they said.\n\n\"On top of our record NHS investment, this winter we are providing an extra \u00a33bn to maintain independent sector and Nightingale hospital surge capacity and a further \u00a3450m to upgrade and expand A&Es.\"\n\nVaccine chances'high'\n\nMeanwhile, Prof Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, was upbeat when asked about the possibility of people receiving the Oxford jab by the end of the year. \n\nThe vaccine has not yet been approved by the UK's regulator, but a study this week showed it was safe and effective.\n\n\"I think the chances are pretty high,\"she told the BBC's Andrew Marr.\"But we do need multiple vaccines, all countries need multiple vaccines, the world needs multiple vaccines and we need vaccines made using different technologies, if that's possible.\"\nTL;DR: People must think \"really carefully\" about the risk of more social contact over Christmas, NHS bosses have warned.\n\nArticle: The case was closed after a prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to press charges against either the owners of the mine or regulators. \n\nOne of the miners said it was a\"disgrace for justice\"while a former minister called it\"unbelievable\".\n\nThe miners' rescue in a special capsule was followed live around the world.\n\n'Deep hole'\n\n\"This is a disgrace to Chile's justice system,'' one of the survivors, Mario Sepulveda, told Associated Press news agency, \n\n\"It is impossible that in an accident of this magnitude no-one is held responsible. Today, I want to dig a deep hole and bury myself again, only this time, I don't want anybody to find me, he said.\n\nOne of Mr Sepulveda's colleagues said he got in touch with their lawyers as soon as he heard about the decision.\n\n\"[They] told us to be calm. We have another lawsuit, for negligence,\"Luis Urzua told AFP, \n\nFormer mining minister Laurence Golborne, who was in charge of the rescue operations, expressed disbelief at the decision.\n\nHe told Chilean radio Cooperativa that regulators had ordered the owners of the century-old mine to build an emergency exit, but they did not comply. \n\nMr Golborne said that if the measure had been implemented the miners\"would not have spent 70 days trapped\".\n\nSenator Isabel Allende, daughter of the late President Salvador Allende, said the decision was\"painful\".\n\n\"It's hard to accept that the prosecution considers there is no-one responsible\", Ms Allende told EFE.\n\nBut defence lawyer Catherine Lathrop praised the decision.\n\n\"We have always maintained that it was a regrettable accident. Just that, an accident, and neither was it possible to establish any responsibility of my clients in this case,\"she said.\n\nThe collapse of the San Jose mine, near the town of Copiapo, left the 33 miners completely isolated for two weeks at a depth of about 700m.\n\nThey shared emergency rations to survive until rescue workers built a small shaft which was used to send supplies to the group.\n\nIn 2012, on the second anniversary of the collapse, many of the miners attended the inauguration of a monument at the mine.\n\nChilean billionaire Leonardo Farkas gave each of the miners a gift of $10,000 (\u00a36,600) after the rescue. \n\nThe miners hope that a lawsuit filed a year after the collapse accusing the National Service of Geology and Mining of having not inspected working conditions and mine safety can bring each of them reparations of $500,000 (\u00a3330,000).\n\nThe owners of the mine have been told to reimburse the government a quarter of the rescue operation which cost around $22m.\nTL;DR: An investigation into the 2010 accident in Chile that left 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months has failed to find anyone responsible.\n\nArticle: Bethany Vincent, 26, and nine-year-old Darren Henson were found in a house on High Holme Road, Louth, on Monday. \n\nDaniel Boulton, 29, has been arrested on suspicion of their murder.\n\nAn online appeal set up to pay for the pair's funeral has so far raised over \u00a33,500, with one donor to the fund describing Darren as\"a ray of sunshine, always smiling\".\n\nAnother donor said:\"Unable to comprehend what's happened and how the families and community will be affected by this.

It is treated by antibiotics, but some are failing.\n\nThe head of sexually transmitted infection surveillance at the HPA, Dr Gwenda Hughes, said:\"We are very concerned. It is a global problem.\n\n\"[The gonorrhoea bacterium] is very successful at developing resistance to every treatment used in the past few decades.\n\n\"We are worried that in the next five years, or some point in the future, that this is going to be a very difficult infection to treat.\"\n\nEven the most resistant forms of the disease are not yet untreatable. \n\nProfessor Cathy Ison, a gonorrhoea expert at the HPA, said that in the past, when resistance emerged, a new drug would be used.\n\nHowever, she warned:\"We don't have a new drug.\"\n\nCases rising again\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, the number of new sexually transmitted infections being diagnosed fell for the first time in more than a decade. \n\nHowever, cases have since increased, with nearly 427,000 new infections diagnosed in 2011.\n\nMore accurate tests and more people being tested explain some of the rise.\n\nBut the HPA said it was concerned about\"ongoing, unsafe sexual behaviour\"in at-risk groups.\n\nDr Hughes said two groups - young adults and men who have sex with men - were of particular concern.\n\nThere was a 4% drop in the number of diagnoses of chlamydia in young adults. However, this has been attributed to fewer people getting screened.\n\nSexually active people under 25 are advised to be checked annually or when they have a change of sexual partner. Yet the number of tests fell from 2.3 million to 2.1 million between 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe government said too many people were not taking care of their sexual health.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said:\"Sexually transmitted infections can lead to infertility and other serious health problems. The message is clear: whatever your age, you should always use a condom.\"\n\nLisa Power, from sexual-health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:\"These figures must act as a wake-up call, not only to sexually active people but also to the government and public-health services. \n\n\"They represent a step backwards for the nation's sexual health.

Artists like New Order made history, he says.\n\n\"If anybody's got a right to be nostalgic about things, then it's people like that - people who were involved in the scene and are here to tell the tale.

Otherwise, The Courteeners have played arenas and The Ting Tings have enjoyed chart success.\n\nPop nostalgia is certainly not just a Mancunian phenomenon - everybody from The Police to The Pixies have jumped on the reunion bandwagon over the past decade.\n\nThat has coincided with a drop in sales of current guitar music, sparking debate about the supposed\"death of rock\".\n\n\"There are probably more bands in Manchester now than there's ever been before,\"says John Robb, who wrote a book on the Stone Roses and, with his blog  \n          \n \n          Louder Than War\n, is a vocal champion of new music.\n        \n\n\"Every kid seems to be in a band,\"he says.\"You always read this stuff that guitar music's dead. You think, who is this in these rehearsal rooms I go to?\n\n\"There are bands crammed into the rooms.

But [now] you could probably find 2,000-3,000 good bands in town.\"\n\nSo why does it seem harder to break through?\n\nNatalie-Eve Williams, who co-hosts Manchester Music and BBC Introducing on BBC Radio Manchester, says shifts in technology and the music industry mean it is more difficult to make an impact.\n\n\"There are bands out there that I'm confident are going to break through, but I do feel that the greats - those big rock'n' roll bands that have this great big following and dominate the market - are a factor of yesteryear, sadly,\"she says.\n\n\"The whole record industry is nothing like it was over the last few decades.\"\n\nRather than relying on record labels, more people self-release material and compete to get noticed on the internet, she says.\n\n\"It's good in one way because it's very much more accessible, but also you don't get the huge budget behind you. \n\n\"Unless you've already reached a certain level, I don't think there's a lot of backing for new bands to go and do what Oasis or The Stone Roses did.\"\n\nOne new group who have been given a big leg up are  \n          \n \n          Dirty North\n, a self-proclaimed\"rap reggae rock indie punk funk blues\"band from Wythenshawe.\n        \n\nThey have been given a support slot with The Stone Roses, after being championed by drummer Reni.\n\nDirty North frontman Johnny Gregory is clearly grateful for the platform, saying gig promoters and record labels are normally reluctant to take a chance on new bands.\n\n\"If you're not established, if you haven't got proof that you can sell out a venue, then, as far as they're concerned, they wouldn't risk losing the money,\"he says.\n\n\"But if you did give that band a chance to play, it might be a chance for them to get established. We're so lucky to be supporting the Stone Roses, and what's to say this won't show us to the UK for the band we are? We wouldn't have had that if it wasn't for the Stone Roses liking us. We wouldn't get that from the biggest music promoters or the biggest venues.\"\n\nSo does all the attention going on high-profile reunions overshadow the current scene?\n\n\"It does and it doesn't,\"Gregory replies, diplomatically.\"If all these bands are reforming, then the attention will be on them and there will be less attention on the small indie night that's full of unsigned bands.\n\n\"No-one's going to write about that when they can write about the Happy Mondays reforming.\n\n\"However, the Stone Roses reforming has given us the biggest gig we've ever had. So I can't say that it's a bad thing.\"\nTL;DR: Manchester has produced some of Britain's best and most influential bands, and most of them are back this summer. As the oldies lumber back into action, are they threatening to cast a shadow over the next generation of rock 'n' roll stars?\n\nArticle: Some 940 staff posts and 170 agency workers will go at Portsmouth, which is also losing shipbuilding.\n\nA further 835 jobs will go at yards in Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife and at the firm's Filton office, near Bristol.\n\nWorkers were told on Thursday that a trawl for voluntary redundancies would begin next Monday.\n\nThey were also told the redundancies would affect every part of the workforce.\n\nThe programme of job-shedding in the Scottish workforce is expected to start with nearly 190 jobs going within the next three months, many of them painters.\n\n'Constructive discussions'\n\nNext year is scheduled to see nearly 120 more jobs go. \n\nIn 2015, more than half of the total is due to go, and then 100 jobs in 2016, leaving a workforce of around 2,400.\n\nBy contrast, the Portsmouth workforce is to see all 940 shipbuilding jobs lost during next year, with most going in the second half of 2014. Management and unions are looking for ways to transfer staff from the yard into maritime services, which employs more than 3000 people in the naval dockyard. \n\nA spokesman for BAE said:\"We have held two days of constructive discussions with our trade unions. \n\n\"This is the start of an extensive consultation process and we are committed to working tirelessly together to explore all potential options to mitigate the impact of our proposals on our employees.\"\n\nJamie Webster, GMB union convenor at BAE's Govan yard, described further news on job losses from management as\"a mixed bag\".\n\n\"On the plus side, the redundancies are scheduled over three years, which eased the pain slightly,\"he told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"On the downside, some of the sections are getting hit very, very quickly.\"\n\nHe said that by the nature of the business some trades across the shipyards would be\"hit harder\"than others.\n\n\"All will have to experience some sort of pain, and they appreciated that,\"he said.\n\nMr Webster said there were\"a few things\"where the union was\"not entirely happy with the company's approach\", but he did not give details.\n\nHe said those issues would be the subject of\"more dialogue\".\n\nThe union convenor said redundancy notices had been served on the workforce on Wednesday and the search for volunteers would begin next week.\n\n\"We expect a reasonable response from that because we do have a significant proportion of an ageing workforce,\"he said.\"That will ease the strain a bit.\"\n\nMr Webster said the workforce had dealt with news of the job cuts\"admirably\"and with\"great resilience\".\n\nIndependence row\n\nHe added:\"We'll all stay unified and we'll all stay dignified and that's what will take us through.\"\n\nFollowing last week's job loss announcement, a row broke out between Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon over the impact on shipbuilding of a\"Yes\"vote in next year's independence referendum. \n\nMr Carmichael said it would be\"difficult to see how the work would go to Scotland\"if it was independent but Ms Sturgeon said any suggestions of work being lost was\"preposterous\"and said the Clyde ports were now the only places in the UK which could carry out the construction work.\n\nMr Webster dismissed any suggestion that the referendum was a major factor for the workforce.\n\n\"We have no intentions over the next 10 months of worrying about politics,\"he said.\n\nThe union convenor said the workforce would\"focus on the ships we're building and the rest will take care of itself\".\n\nMeanwhile, a defence minister told MPs on the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee that the construction of warships for the Royal Navy is likely to be moved away from the Clyde to Portsmouth if Scotland votes for independence next year.\n\nAppearing before the committee on Thursday, Andrew Murrison rejected suggestions that the only yards capable of carrying out the work were in Glasgow.\n\nHe claimed it would be possible to revive shipbuilding in Portsmouth after a Yes vote north of the border, and said there were other locations - such as Barrow - which might be able to do the job with sufficient investment.\nTL;DR: BAE Systems has told staff at its UK shipyards that 1,775 job losses will be phased in over the next three years.\n\nArticle: By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nThe pay-off for all that poring over the figures is that for once they are the most important person in the room. \n\nBut despite all the preparation and planning, the announcements don't always go to plan. We take a look at some of the biggest disasters in Budget history. \n\n1. Pastygate\n\nIt was a headline writer's dream. In 2012, one of the more obscure Budget proposals from Chancellor George Osborne was the introduction of a 20% VAT on pasties, rotisserie chickens and other hot food sold by bakeries and supermarkets. \n\nThe Treasury said that because VAT was already charged on most hot food, extending it to pies and pasties closed a\"loophole\".\n\nYet the idea was quickly translated into an attack on the working man's lunch. Cornish MP Stephen Gilbert said the pasty was\"a staple, hearty meal\"that must be protected. \n\nMr Osborne couldn't remember the last time he'd eaten a pasty from High Street chain Greggs, while Prime Minister David Cameron's claim to love them backfired when the Leeds shop he said he had bought one from turned out to have closed down years earlier. \n\nMr Osborne's suggestion that people could dodge the tax by buying cold pies led to him being branded a modern-day Marie Antoinette.\"LET THEM EAT COLD PASTY\"read the Sun's headline.\n\nThe pasty tax fiasco led to accusations that the Conservatives were out of touch and two months later the plan was ditched. \n\nWhile pastygate grabbed the headlines, Mr Osborne was also forced to backtrack on several other proposed tax rises, including  charging 20% VAT on alterations to historic buildings and static caravans - leading to 2012 being known as the\"omnishambles Budget\".\n\n2. Chancellor hits white van man\n\nMarch 2017 was Philip Hammond's first Budget as chancellor and it's fair to say it didn't go well. Dubbed\"Spreadsheet Phil\"for his dull but steady approach to the nation's finances, his big announcement was a plan to raise National Insurance contributions for self-employed workers. \n\n\"Hopeless Hammond\", as one newspaper described him, was immediately accused of breaking a 2015 Conservative manifesto pledge not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont described the move as\"a rookie error\"and tabloid newspapers decried the\"tax raid\"on\"white van man\"- Britain's army of self-employed builders, plumbers and electricians.\n\n\"Rob the Builder\",\"Spite Van Man\"and\"Hammond hits white van man\"went the headlines. \n\nLabour urged the government to\"think again\"on the change, which would have meant 1.6 million people paying \u00a3240 on average more every year.\n\nAs the backlash against what the Sun described as a\"strivers' tax\"gathered pace, Mr Hammond did indeed think again. Just seven days after he had announced the policy, he ditched it. He justified the rapid U-turn by saying the reversal showed\"we are listening\".\n\nAnother word entered the political lexicon: the\"omNICshambles\".\n\n3. Unforeseen consequences?\n\nForeseeable or not, chancellors have been caught out by the knock-on impact of their policy announcements.\n\nIn his final Budget as chancellor in 2007, Gordon Brown announced a surprise cut in the basic rate of income tax funded by abolishing  the 10% starting rate.\n\nHe trumpeted the changes as a giveaway to middle-earning voters, but the move left millions of low-income workers worse off. \n\nMr Brown initially refused to acknowledge that there would be any losers from his changes. But under attack from the opposition, and also from his own party, he was forced to agree a compensation package for those who'd lost out. \n\nCritics say it was one of the biggest mistakes of his political career and led to a loss of trust in his leadership when he became prime minister later that year. \n\n4. Heard it before?\n\nBudget decisions are supposed to remain secret until the chancellor speaks.\n\nBut in 2013, just 20 minutes before Chancellor George Osborne addressed Parliament, the Evening Standard published a photo of its front page on Twitter. \n\nIt clearly showed details of the chancellor's big announcements, including his scrapping of the annual alcohol duty escalator and the rise in the personal tax allowance to \u00a310,000 by April 2014.\n\nBy the time Mr Osborne stood up to talk, jeering Labour party members were waving photocopies of the newspaper's front page at him, claiming he\"almost need not have bothered coming\"given the details were in the newspaper. \n\nThe paper apologised for what it called\"a very serious mistake\". It had been given an early briefing on the Budget under embargo, to allow it to prepare its first edition, which goes to press during the chancellor's speech. \n\nSome leaks have cost ministers their jobs. Labour Chancellor Hugh Dalton famously quit in 1947 when it was discovered he had told a journalist about some of his Budget before his statement.\n\nMr Dalton's biographer said the decision to quit was also driven by his frustration at the deteriorating state of the economy. The year was dubbed the\"annus horrendus\"for Labour with a severe winter freeze and rationing.\n\nIn the 1930s, Labour Cabinet minister Jimmy Thomas also resigned after he blurted out Budget secrets to a Tory MP on a golf course.\n\n5. It was ever thus\n\nIt's not just modern-day chancellors who have run into trouble over their Budgets.\n\nWinston Churchill's 1925 Budget returned Britain to the gold standard at a fixed rate of $4.80 to the pound.\n\nThe aim was to restore Britain's position at the centre of the world's financial system. But critics now argue the high rate made UK industry uncompetitive and prolonged the Great Depression. \n\nMeanwhile, in 1931 in the middle of a recession, Labour Chancellor Philip Snowden cut unemployment benefit and reduced public salaries.\n\nThe results were riots in the streets and a mutiny among sailors in the Royal Navy at Invergordon in Scotland, which virtually crippled the Fleet. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Britain's slump deepened, rather than improved.\nTL;DR: Budget day is a chancellor's day to shine. It's when the prime minister's number-crunching sidekick finally gets a chance to step out of the shadows.\n\nArticle: Ringleader Yasser Shah, from Bolton, ran a group which transported drugs from the Midlands to the north of England, police said.\n\nOfficers seized 21kg (46lb) of cocaine in raids on the gang who ran the operation from Bolton and Blackburn.\n\nShah was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court to 17 years on Tuesday, three other men also jailed. \n\nThe North West Organised Crime Unit said the gang moved large quantities of the class A drug between March 2018 and May 2019.  \n\nShah controlled couriers who collected, transported and delivered the drugs on his behalf, it said.\n\nThe couriers then passed the drugs on to\"distributors\"who sent the drugs down the supply chain.\n\nBilal Ashraf was stopped by police on his way back from Coventry on 13 December 2018 and was found with 10kg of cocaine. \n\nOn 28 February 2019, Hassam Rasool was stopped returning from Telford and arrested in possession of 10kg of cocaine he had collected from Martin Lewis.\n\nThe following May, Gul Bahar was arrested in Tesco car park in Halifax after a police officers seized 1kg of the drug in the vehicle he was in. \n\nShah was arrested later the same day after being stopped by police and linked to the earlier offences.  \n\nShah, Rasool and Ashraf pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine on 5 February while Lewis had pleaded guilty to the same offence on 26 July 2019.\n\n\u2022       Yasser Shah, 31, of Tenby Close, Blackburn, sentenced to 17 years \n\n\u2022       Hassam Rasool, 26, of Rhyl Avenue, Blackburn, sentenced to 11 years\n\n\u2022       Martin Lewis, 54, of Chain Lane, Stafford, given nine years \n\n\u2022       Bilal Ashraf, 30, of no fixed address, handed five years, which he will serve after finishing his current sentence\n\nA fifth man Gul Bahar, 38, of Park Terrace, Halifax will be sentenced on 22 May.\nTL;DR: A drugs gang caught with cocaine with an estimated street value of \u00a3600,000 have been jailed.\n\nArticle: By John McManusBBC News\n\nFor only the second time, the 10-yearly survey will include an optional question about religious belief.\n\nSome secular groups, including the British Humanist Association, say the question is skewed and may overstate the extent of religious affiliation.\n\nThe campaign slogan was changed to drop the words\"for God's sake\"after advice from advertising regulators.\n\nPoster campaign\n\nThe secular groups want people who are not religious to tick the box saying\"No religion\"on the census.\n\nThe British Humanist Association (BHA) has unveiled a series of posters on buses and billboards across the country.\n\nUsing the slogan\"Not religious? In this year's census, say so\", they hope to persuade people to think carefully about which option to tick on the census form, which is being delivered to every household in the country this month.\n\nThe question about religious belief allows respondents to choose from several possible answers, including\"No religion\",\"Christian\", or\"Hindu\". \n\nBut BHA chief executive Andrew Copson believes the wording of the question in the last census resulted in 72% of people being classed as Christians - a figure which is much higher than other surveys.\n\n\"Instead of asking,'Do you have a religion and if so, what is it?', the question asks'What is your religion?', a closed question that funnels people into giving a religious response, even if they don't go to a church or a mosque, even if they don't believe in God.\"\n\nA similar sentiment was expressed by Prof Richard Dawkins who told the BBC more precise questions need to be asked\"if you want to use information for political purposes\".\n\nHe said:\"If you really, really want to know whether people are religious in the true sense - the sense that everybody understands about religion - ask a specific question: Do you believe Muhammad rode on a winged horse? - something like that.\"\n\nMr Copson also says that the placing of the religious question close to other questions about ethnicity encourages white British householders - even those who never go to church - to tick\"Christian\"because they believe it is part of their overall cultural identity.\n\nThe BHA warns that getting the figures wrong may have a direct impact on civil society.\n\nConsultation process\n\n\"If the number of religious people is artificially inflated in the census, then public policy in matters of religion and belief will unduly favour religious lobbies and discriminate against people who do not live their lives under religion,\"Mr Copson says. \n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is responsible for the census, says that the wording of the 2001 question on religion was decided after consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. \n\nThe same wording has been kept for this year's survey in order to effectively map any changes.\n\nThe think tank Theos, which undertakes research into religious matters, believes that the ONS never set out to measure how many people regularly attend organised worship.\n\nPaul Bickley, one of the researchers at Theos, says the census information on religion is not used in the far-reaching manner that the BHA believes, and that the 72% figure for Christians can be qualified and challenged by other data.\n\n'Cultural affiliation'\n\n\"All data has to be interpreted; the facts never speak for themselves. I don't think it has been used to underpin controversial policies. The power of this statistic is that it is illustrative. It's not as if Tony Blair saw the 2001 census results and thought,'Hang on, let's start opening more faith schools.'\"\n\nMr Bickley says the census question is right to measure cultural affiliation, because that is how many people actively choose to identify themselves, even if they do not regularly practise a faith.\n\nThis in turn presents a  different point of view to the argument that the UK is becoming a more secular society.\n\n\"You can't say,'If you don't practise, you're really a humanist, please tick the'No religion' box'. I think that's to go too far,\"Mr Bickley says. \n\nThe BHA's new poster campaign has already suffered from one setback.\n\nThe original campaign slogan was refused by the company CBS Outdoors, which owns much of the advertising space in Britain's railway stations, following advice from industry body the Committee of Advertising Practice.\n\nThe slogan -\"If you're not religious, for God's sake say so\"- was judged to contravene codes designed to prevent offence to religious people.\n\nCBS Outdoors has maintained its ban for the updated slogan too - but it will appear on the sides of more than 200 buses across the country.\nTL;DR: Campaigners are urging members of the public who are not religious to say so in the national census.\n\nArticle: Michael Hardy, Prospect, Richard Worth, and a fourth company, Romans, broke competition law by running the cartel. \n\nIt set minimum commission rates for properties in Wokingham, Winnersh, Crowthorne, Bracknell and Warfield.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Romans would not be fined as it informed it about the racket.\n\nThe agents regularly met up to discuss private pricing details after initially fixing fees in September 2008, the CMA said. \n\nMichael Grenfell, CMA's executive director of enforcement, said:\"It is disappointing we've found yet another case of estate agents breaking competition law. \n\n\"We trust that the fines issued today will reinforce our message that we expect the sector to clean up its act and make sure customers are not being ripped off in this way. \n\n\"The industry needs to take note - this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.

The game files are enormous\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 requires 107 gigabytes of installation space on the Xbox One. \n\nOn the PlayStation 4 it's 99GB with an extra 50GB required for installation, the studio has said.\n\nAccording to the games site Games Radar that makes the game the heftiest PS4 download ever.\n\nSecond on its list was Battlefield 4 Premium Edition, weighing in at 71GB.\n\nThe game is so big because of its expansive world and attention to tiny details (more on that in a moment) - but it could prove an obstacle to fans with slow broadband and limited storage.\n\n2. Those little details...\n\nOne of the reasons why the game is so enormous is that there are a lot of exquisite little details.\n\nThe detail that has inevitably caught everybody's attention is that apparently when the weather is cold, a certain part of the horse's anatomy can be seen to shrink. \n\nLike in Grand Theft Auto, the weather conditions and even interactions between the 200 species of in-game wildlife are auto-generated, and each item held by the main character, Arthur Morgan, is individually rendered so it moves in its own right as he rides on his horse.\n\n3. RIP Horses\n\nSpeaking of horses - in Red Dead Redemption 2, if your horse dies, it stays dead. You won't see it again. People are very sad about this.\n\n4. Long working hours for studio staff\n\nIn a Vulture magazine interview, Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser praised staff for working 100-hour weeks to get Red Dead Redemption 2 finished. \n\nIt had already missed two previous launch dates - Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 - on the grounds that it wasn't ready.\n\nMr Houser has since clarified that he was referring only to himself and three other members of the senior writing team. \n\nHowever so-called\"crunch culture\"is a controversial area of games development, where developers can be asked or feel obliged to work long hours in the run-up to a title release.\n\n\"The problem is that most people in games get into games because they love them, and that lets companies take advantage of these,\"said Grand Theft Auto and Lemmings creator Mike Dailly.\n\n\"They push developers to work these stupid hours, yet they could easily release the game with a little less content, and it would still be a massive game.\"\n\n5. The gameplay takes 60 hours\n\nDan Houser told Vulture magazine that the 60-hour story mode was shortened from 65 hours in the edit by abandoning a love interest. \n\nFor context, experiencing everything Grand Theft Auto V has to offer would take more than 100 hours, Mr Houser told The Guardian in 2013 when it came out.\n\nHowever it's often said most gamers don't ever finish a game - CNN once put the figure at 90%.\nTL;DR: The hotly anticipated game Red Dead Redemption 2 is due for release on Friday.\n\nArticle: He accused Labour of using the nuclear deterrent as a\"bargaining chip\"with the SNP, which would vote to scrap it.\n\nEd Miliband said Labour was committed to renewing the Trident system.\n\nSNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said her party would not agree a formal deal with Labour - including\"confidence and supply\"- unless Trident was dropped.\n\nBut she left the option of a vote-by-vote arrangement open. \n\nIn other general election campaign news:\n\nThe Conservatives and Labour are both committed to replacing the UK's ageing fleet of Vanguard class submarines which carry Trident nuclear missiles and maintaining the continuous, at-sea deterrent - meaning there is always one nuclear-armed vessel on patrol.\n\nLabour has suggested the possibility of reducing the number of submarines from four to three if a continuous deterrent could be maintained, although Mr Miliband said their position at the moment was to stick with four. \n\nThe Liberal Democrats favour cutting to three, saying the existing system was designed for the Cold War era.\n\nPolicy guide: Where the parties stand\n\nThe Clyde-based submarines, designed in Barrow in Cumbria, are due to reach the end of their operational lives within the next decade.\n\nA final decision on replacing the system is due in 2016.\n\nThe government in 2013 put the bill at between \u00a315bn and \u00a320bn. However, the Green Party said it could run to \u00a3100bn.\n\nThe Lib Dems have said ordering fewer submarines would save up to \u00a34bn in the long-term, though that claim is disputed.\n\n'Backroom deal'\n\nThe SNP has said it would work with Labour in order to keep the Conservatives out of government after the 7 May general election, but it opposes renewing Trident and calls the issue a\"red line\".\n\nLabour has said it will not form a coalition with the SNP, but Tory leader David Cameron has said Labour failed to rule out a post-election\"deal\".\n\nFact check: How much would Trident replacement cost?\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said it will cost \u00a317.5bn to \u00a323.4bn to procure the replacement system. That is the estimate at 2013-14 prices.\n\nOf that, between \u00a312.9bn and \u00a316.4bn would be spent on the submarines themselves.\n\nThe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) has arrived at the round \u00a3100bn figure by two routes. One is to take the MoD's stated intention to spend 5-6% of its defence budget on running its nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe different approach is a breakdown of costs. \n\nRead more from Douglas Fraser, our Scotland business editor\n\nMr Fallon confirmed the existing Tory policy of four new submarines would feature in the election manifesto.\n\nHe also said Ed Miliband was\"a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the SNP\".\n\nMs Sturgeon's\"brusque demands should alarm people right across our United Kingdom\", Mr Fallon said.\n\n\"Our nuclear submarines protect all of Britain including Scotland. This SNP policy is a threat to us all that would dangerously weaken our collective defence,\"he added.\n\nIn a personal attack, Mr Fallon also told Today the Labour leadership election - in which Mr Miliband stood against his brother - showed what he would do to get into power.\n\nMr Fallon said:\"You've seen what he's prepared to do to get into power, the danger now, the risk we face in four weeks time, is that we'll see the same kind of shabby manoeuvre, perhaps with Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP, to get into Downing Street on the back of abandoning our nuclear submarines.\"\n\nBut Mr Miliband said national security was too important to play politics with and accused the Tories of running a campaign based on\"deceit and lies\".\n\nHe said:\"We are committed to independent nuclear deterrent, we are committed to renewing trident, we are committed to continuous at-sea deterrent.\"\n\nSpeaking at Wednesday night's Scottish political leaders' debate on BBC One Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said:\"It is often asked of me: is Trident a red line? Well here's your answer - you'd better believe it's a red line.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon later told the BBC she would not agree any formal power-sharing deal with Labour unless Mr Miliband dropped plans to renew Trident. \n\nMs Sturgeon made clear that would include a confidence and supply agreement, Scottish political correspondent Glenn Campbell said.\n\nShe said the SNP could still work with a minority Labour government on an issue-by-issue basis but would not vote for anything that supported Trident renewal. \n\nAsked specifically if this would mean voting down a Queen's Speech, she declined to confirm that it would. \n\n'Worth retaining'\n\nThe issue provoked a coalition row in the previous government when the Lib Dems requested a report examining possible alternatives.\n\nSir Nick Harvey, the Lib Dem defence spokesman, told Radio 4's Today programme the nuclear deterrent was\"worth retaining\".\n\nBut he said it did not need to be\"patrolling the seas 24/7 when we have no known nuclear adversary\". \n\nMaintaining three submarines would allow the UK to maintain\"continuous at-sea deterrence\", he said. Two submarines would provide a\"perfectly meaningful deterrent\", but not on a\"continuous basis\", he added. \n\nLib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was\"quite extraordinary\"the Conservatives think Trident is\"the most important thing for which they're in politics\".\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted:\"Tory Hypocrisy: hitting out at Labour over SNP when they went into coalition with Trident-opposed Lib Dems in 2010 #voteUKIP #defence.\"\n\nGreen Party leader Natalie Bennett said:\"The truth is that the Labour leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending \u00a3100bn on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs.\"\n\nAll of the parties have faced questions during the election campaign about their plans for defence spending.\n\nNeither Labour nor the Conservatives have committed to matching the Nato target of 2% of GDP beyond 2016. UKIP says it would meet this commitment by cutting foreign aid.\n\nSubscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.\nTL;DR: The Conservatives' manifesto will have a commitment to build four new nuclear missile-armed submarines, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said.\n\nArticle: Interior Minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo did not name the man but said he had been arrested for\"investigative purposes\".\n\nAn unnamed government official told the Associated Press that the man is Ola Bini, a Swedish software developer.\n\nIt comes just hours after Assange was himself arrested at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.\n\n\"A person close to Wikileaks, who has been residing in Ecuador, was arrested this afternoon when he was preparing to travel to Japan,\"Ecuador's interior ministry tweeted late on Thursday.\n\nThe man has lived in Ecuador for several years and has frequently travelled to the country's London embassy where Assange had been staying, Ms Romo told CNN's Spanish language service.\n\n\"He has been detained simply for investigation purposes,\"she said.\n\nAn Ecuadorean official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that Mr Bini had been arrested at Quito Airport.\n\nAs news of the arrest broke, friends and colleagues of Mr Bini expressed their concern on social media.\n\n\"I'm very concerned to hear that [he] has been arrested,\"Martin Fowler, a US-based computer programmer, tweeted.\"He is a strong advocate and developer supporting privacy and has not been able to speak to any lawyers.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Ms Romo held a press conference and said a person with close links to Wikileaks was living in Ecuador.\n\nIn response, Mr Bini said on Twitter that her comments showed a\"witch hunt\"was under way.\n\nWhat happened on Thursday?\n\nEcuador withdrew Assange's asylum on Thursday and the Metropolitan Police say they were then invited into the embassy to arrest him.\n\nHe took refuge in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped.\n\nEcuadorean President Lenin Moreno said the country had\"reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange\".\n\nThere has been a long-running dispute between the Ecuadorian authorities and Assange about what he was and was not allowed to do in the embassy.\n\nAfter his arrest, Assange was taken to a central London court and found guilty of failing to surrender to the court in 2012. \n\nAs well as that charge, he now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets.\n\nThe UK will decide whether to extradite him to the US.

including the partial pedestrianisation of Union Street - could create 5,500 jobs and an extra \u00a3280m in income a year.\n\nDozens of projects have been put forward by architects BDP after a public consultation.\n\nCouncil leader Jenny Laing told Wednesday's meeting it was a\"once in a generation opportunity\".\n\nA delegation of leading city figures started the meeting by offering support to the masterplan, with Prof Ferdinand von Prondzynski of Robert Gordon University saying it was time for action after a\"number of false starts\".\n\n'Elegant centre'\n\nFrancis Glare, of BDP, told councillors that all city centres were responding to the challenges of competing for investment.\n\nHe said Aberdeen needed a city centre for a\"global city\".\n\nMr Glare said 85% of respondents wanted more space for people in Aberdeen city centre.\n\nHe said that Union Street could become\"elegant\"and attract new business.\n\nAnd Mr Glare stressed the\"spectacle\"of the working Aberdeen harbour should be opened up, describing it as\"relatively unique\"compared to some other cities, and a\"very attractive feature\".\n\nCouncillor Alan Donnelly expressed fears that pedestrianisation could be\"challenging\"due to the significant amount of displaced traffic.\n\nCouncillor Marie Boulton said it was a\"momentous day for Aberdeen\", and that it had been made clear to BDP that the council did not want another plan to\"sit on the shelf\".\n\nCouncillor Ross Thomson said he took heart from the\"political unity\", and that it was time to repair the city's\"broken heart\".\n\nCouncillors had agreed not to comment on the plans before the meeting.\n\nWhat is the Aberdeen'masterplan?'\n\nThe plan pulls together key housing, building, transportation and regeneration proposals to transform parts of the city.\n\nIntervention areas\n\nThe report says the focus is on areas that are less well used or failing to deliver the scale of activity expected in a thriving and successful city centre.\n\nDenburn Valley\n\nProposals include an expansion of the Union Terrace Gardens and a new urban quarter at the head of the\"valley\".\n\nQueen's Square\n\nThe vision for Queen's Square includes cafes, shops, apartments and pedestrian friendly streets.\n\nUnion Street West\n\nThe city redevelopment is designed to cement the west of Union street as \"an elegant city quarter\", with focus around the refurbished Music Hall and new City Rooms.\n\nStation gateway\n\nA redesigned\"gateway\"between Union Street and the station aims to\"radically improve first impressions of Aberdeen\".\n\nCastlegate/Castlehill\n\nThe idea for Castlegate is to position it as Aberdeen city centre's main civic square, forming a crossroads between Union Street, the harbourside and the beach.\n\nNorth Dee\n\nPlans for North Dee aim to cement an identity as the city's business quarter, with a Global Energy Hub at its centre.\n\nTorry Waterfront\n\nVisions for the waterfront include a link to the city across a new pedestrian bridge to create a new residential community\"like no other\"in Aberdeen.\nTL;DR: Aberdeen councillors have agreed a masterplan for the city centre.\n\nArticle: Speaking in his first interview since the July killing of Cecil the lion, Walter Palmer said he had been unaware of the animal's significance. \n\nHe also revealed that there had been\"some safety issues\"for his family.\n\nZimbabwe has said it wishes to extradite and prosecute Mr Palmer.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time about the incident, he told the Associated Press and Minneapolis Star Tribune  that he had acted legally, but said that if he had known who the animal was he would not have killed it.\n\n\"If I had known this lion had a name and was important to the country or a study obviously I wouldn't have taken it,\"Mr Palmer said.\"Nobody in our hunting party knew before or after the name of this lion.\"\n\nThe Minnesota dentist admitted that he wounded the lion with an arrow but denied that it had subsequently taken 40 hours to track down and kill it. He also denied claims by the Zimbabwean authorities that it had been killed by a gun, saying that an arrow had been used.\n\nThe 55-year-old is believed to have paid $50,000 (\u00a332,000) to hunt a lion in Zimbabwe's largest game reserve.\n\nHow do you transport a lion's head?\n\nWhen is hunting not poaching \n\nCecil the lion in pictures\n\nFamily threats\n\nMr Palmer was forced to cease working following protests outside of his dentistry practice.\n\nHe says he intends to return to work because\"my staff and my patients support me and they want me back\".\n\nHowever, he denied that he had been forced into hiding for his own safety.\n\n\"I've been out of the public eye. That doesn't mean I'm in hiding,\"adding:\"I've been among people, family and friends\".\n\nMr Palmer did reveal that his wife and daughter had faced intimidation.\n\n\"They've been threatened in the social media, and again \u2026 I don't understand that level of humanity to come after people not involved at all,\"he said.\n\nAn avid hunter who had previously visited Zimbabwe four times, he did not rule out returning to the country, \n\n\"I don't know about the future,\"he said.\n\n\"Zimbabwe has been a wonderful country for me to hunt in, and I have always followed the laws.\"\n\nCecil the lion\n\nWhat Cecil the lion means to Zimbabwe\n\nHow the internet hunted the hunter\nTL;DR: The US dentist who sparked an international outcry after killing a lion in Zimbabwe has said he did nothing wrong and is planning to return to work this week.\n\nArticle: Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2014.\n\nThat was a slowdown from 0.7% growth recorded in the previous three months.\n\nEconomists were mixed over whether the loss of momentum in the final quarter might be temporary or prolonged.\n\nThe ONS's chief economist, Joe Grice, said it was\"too early to say\"if this slowdown would persist.\n\n\"The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic,\"he said.\n\nBut Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the fourth-quarter figure\"hardly set the world alight... and it's clear that [the economy] is slowing\".\n\nShe said:\"There are clouds looming large on the horizon, and the general election is the biggest of these. Investors don't like uncertainty.\"\n\nThe services sector grew by 0.8% in the quarter, but construction contracted by 1.8%. Manufacturing grew by just 0.1%, its worst performance since the start of 2013.\n\n\"The main disappointment with growth in the fourth quarter was that it looks unbalanced on the output side of the economy at least,\"said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight.\n\nBut Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed the economy was\"on track\". He warned that the international economic climate was\"getting worse\", and so the government must continue with its economic strategy.\n\nShadow chancellor Ed Balls said the slowdown in fourth-quarter growth was a concern, and that\"Tory claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow with working people\"whose\"wages are down by \u00a31,600 a year since 2010\".\n\n'At odds'\n\nThe ONS figures are the first estimate of fourth-quarter growth and could be revised up or down as more economic data for the three months is gathered by the statistics office.\n\nEconomists at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said they\"wouldn't be surprised if the ONS figures are revised up over time, painting a stronger picture for economic performance at the end of the year\".\n\nThe construction data which dragged down the fourth-quarter figures were\"surprising and at odds with other indicators and surveys\"which presented a healthier picture, the CEBR said. \n\nTuesday figures mean the UK was among the best-performing of the all the major economies in 2014. US growth figures are due to be published on Friday, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating expansion of 2.4% for the year.\n\nThe IMF forecasts UK growth of 2.7% in 2015. However, Samuel Tombs, of consultancy Capital Economics, has predicted growth of 3%.\n\n\"With the recent halving of oil prices providing a timely boost to households' discretionary spending power, credit still becoming cheaper and pay growth on an improving trend... the best days of the UK's recovery may still lie ahead,\"he said.\n\nAnalysis: Robert Peston, BBC economics editor\n\nHow significant is the slowdown in the British economy, given that the dominant service sector is still booming, but construction is shrinking and manufacturing almost back to flatlining?\n\nThe deceleration is not surprising, in view of the flatlining of the UK's main trading partner, the eurozone.\n\nAnd two of the negative influences, a fall in energy supply of 2.8% and in construction of 1.8%, are in industries that tend to be volatile.\n\nThat said, it does give pause for thought that growth is now apparently being driven to a large extent by retail and consumer spending.\n\nWe were supposed to be rebalancing, towards manufacturing and investment. And although there has been a bit of that over the past couple of years, it appears to be petering out.\n\nRead Robert's blog in full\nTL;DR: The UK's economy grew by 2.6% last year, the fastest pace since 2007 and up from 1.7% in 2013, official figures have shown.\n\nArticle: The ECB held the euro area's key interest rate in October and maintained its quantitative easing (QE) scheme which is due to run until March 2017.\n\nPresident Mario Draghi said there had not, so far, been talks on ending QE. \n\nHowever, he signalled it would be discussed in December and is likely to be gradually wound down, or\"tapered\". \n\nMr Draghi said:\"Our decisions in December will tell you what we are going to do. That will define the monetary policy environment for the coming weeks and coming months.\"\n\n'Smooth implementation'\n\nMr Draghi said it was\"unlikely\"that there would be an abrupt end to the bond-buying programme. \n\nHe said that the ECB was waiting until December to address the issue because\"we want to see all the inputs that are useful to have this discussions\"which will\"ensure the smooth implementation of our purchase programme until March 2017 or beyond if necessary\".\n\nMarkets have been searching for clues on whether the ECB will extend the QE programme beyond March next year. Eurozone inflation is rising, up to 0.4% in September, while economic growth is slowing from 0.5% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the three months to September. \n\nUnanswered questions\n\nMr Draghi warned that the European economy was vulnerable to downside risks including\"subdued foreign demand\". He added:\"We will continue to act, if warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate.\"\n\nJames Athey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said:\"This was not Draghi's finest hour. He really wanted to shut down any suggestion that the ECB is going to taper any time soon. But he what he actually did was to tell people to come back in December and see what the ECB thinks then.\n\n\"That will leave enough unanswered questions to keep bond markets volatile. An already nervous market will not take much comfort from his obfuscation today.\"\n\nGrowth risks\n\nCommenting on the European economy, Mr Draghi said:\"The economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still subdued foreign demand, the necessary balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors and sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms.\n\n\"The risks to the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate mainly to the external environment.\"\n\nHe was speaking as UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Brussels for her first European Union summit since taking office, following the British vote to leave the EU.  \n\nShe said:\"This is my first European Council and I'm here with a very clear message: The UK is leaving the EU but we will continue to play a full role until we leave and we'll be a strong and dependable partner after we have left. \n\n\"It's in the interests of both the UK and the EU that we continue to work closely together, including at this summit.\"\nTL;DR: The European Central Bank (ECB) will discuss how to end its monthly \u20ac80bn (\u00a371bn) bond-buying programme in December after leaving it unchanged.\n\nArticle: By Andrew WalkerEconomics correspondent\n\nAlthough the IMF raised its prediction for UK GDP growth this year to 1.8%, the figure for 2017 was cut to 1.1%.\n\nIts assumptions are based on\"smooth post-Brexit negotiations and a limited increase in economic barriers\".\n\nThe IMF's latest World Economic Outlook predicts\"subpar\"global growth this year of 3.1%, rising slightly in 2017. \n\nChief economist Maurice Obstfeld said:\"Taken as a whole, the world economy has moved sideways. Without determined policy action to support economic activity over the short and longer terms, sub-par growth at recent levels risks perpetuating itself.\"\n\nA fall in US growth this year to 1.6%, down from the previous 2.2% forecast, will be offset by increases in countries including Japan, Germany and Russia and India, the IMF said.\n\nEconomists for Brexit, a group of eight influential economists which supported the Leave campaign ahead of the EU referendum, criticised the IMF's forecasts arguing their pre-Brexit forecasts had already been proven wrong.\n\n\"The IMF, together with countless other institutions, forecasted a state of Armageddon which hasn't even come close to materialising in the UK,\"said Graeme Leach, member of Economists for Brexit and chief executive of Macronomics.\n\nHe added:\"The UK economy seems to be strengthening, not weakening. Just today, construction PMI was positive, ahead of many gloomy forecasts. \n\n\"Consumer spending is strong, with retail sales up 6% and car sales also growing.\"\n\nThe group said it still expects the UK to grow 2.6% this year and next, unchanged from its pre-referendum forecast.\n\nPattern of underperformance\n\nThe indifferent economic recovery after the global financial crisis has been a persistent theme in the Fund's regular World Economic Outlook reports. \n\nThe latest report warns of the danger of a pattern of underperformance becoming entrenched. \n\nWeak growth can lead to lower investment, slower productivity growth and the erosion of what the IMF calls\"human capital\"- which means skills and expertise. \n\n'Fraying consensus'\n\nThe UK referendum result highlights wider trends in developed economies, the IMF says. \n\n\"The Brexit vote and the ongoing US presidential election campaign have highlighted a fraying consensus about the benefits of cross-border economic integration,\"the report says.\n\nThe US reference is about the hostility to international trade agreements such as NAFTA, which involves the US, Canada and Mexico,) voiced in the election campaign. \n\nThe Republican candidate Donald Trump has been the most vocal, though not the only voice expressing such views.  \n\nIt is a political trend that has the IMF worried. It argues that an environment hostile to trade would make it harder for commodity exporters and poorer countries to develop new lines of exports. Such a trend would also undermine productivity growth and the spread of knowledge and technology. \n\nMr Obstfeld says:\"It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration. Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy's current doldrums.\"\n\nIn one important area - China - the IMF's concerns have eased somewhat in the short term. Growth has been stable, allaying fears that China's widely reported economic slowdown would be much more abrupt than it has been. \n\nHowever, there is a warning about the country's longer-term prospects and the debt burden faced by many businesses.\n\n\"A still-rising credit-to-GDP ratio and lack of decisive progress in addressing corporate debt and governance concerns in state-owned enterprises raise the risk of a disruptive adjustment,\"the IMF says. \n\nThat could have important international implications especially for commodity and machinery exporters, for which China is a vital market.\nTL;DR: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for UK economic growth next year as it warned that the global recovery remains \"weak and precarious\".\n\nArticle: Great Grimsby MP Melanie Onn described the recruitment drive as\"too little too late\". \n\nHumberside Police is replacing officers who are retiring from the force.\n\nPCC Matthew Grove criticised the MP for politicising the issue and said Labour planned to cut police budgets further than the Conservative government.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Lee Freeman said it was the first time the force had been able to recruit externally in eight years.\n\nThe force previously cut 700 jobs, including 200 officers, as part of its plan to save \u00a331m by 2019.\n\nMr Freeman said they were able to hire new officers because police funding was protected in the last budget.\n\n\"We've reached a stage through the protection of the policing budget that was announced only a few months ago that we can now sustain the current levels that we have,\"he said.\n\nMr Freeman described the news as\"an enormous event for us as an organisation.\"\n\nHe also said the recruitment drive would help increase diversity.\n\n'Deserve better'\n\n\"Our communities are changing enormously within the Humberside area so it's an opportunity to make sure our workforce reflects that.\"\n\nThe recruitment drive starts next month and will run until 2019.\n\nMs Onn accused the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Matthew Grove of\"spin\".\n\n\"Local people deserve better than a PCC who cuts hundreds of officers, then tries to dress up the fact he'll now be keeping the total number of officers the same as a recruitment drive,\"she said.\n\n\"For all the spin, today's announcement means Humberside will be getting no extra police officers in the next three years.\"\n\nIn a statement Matthew Grove said: \"She should also remember Labour's position on police funding just six months ago when the Shadow Home Secretary was saying policing budgets could be cut by 10% under Labour.\"\nTL;DR: A Labour MP has accused Humberside's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) of \"spin\" over the recruitment of 300 new police officers.\n\nArticle: But a pursuits provider says lack of access to the natural environment is holding back the sector's potential.\n\nVisit Wales research found activities ranging from abseiling to zip wire rides by more than 600 providers generated \u00a3481m and created 8,243 jobs.\n\nThe outdoor activities sector is worth up to 10% of Wales' tourism economy, according to the report.\n\nDaytrippers spend \u00a3220m a year while those staying overnight bringing in \u00a3236m, found the report drawn up in partnership with the Wales Activity Tourism Organisation (WATO). Visitors from overseas who stay overnight add a further \u00a324m.\n\nA survey of those taking part in outdoor activities found 54% of those staying overnight said they would not have visited Wales if they were not taking part in the activity.\n\nTourism Minister Edwina Hart said:\"Wales offers a wide range of outdoor activities and adventure opportunities for visitors have an important role to play in attracting visitors to Wales. \n\n\"This sector has increased in popularity in recent years due to a demand for experiences and lifestyle-orientated holidays.\"\n\nPhil Nelson, of Gwynedd-based Surf-Lines said:\"Our biggest restriction is access to the natural environment.\"\n\nMr Nelson, who founded his Llanberis firm in 2000, said providers had changed their offer over the years to meet the growing demand for activities but were still hampered by a relative lack of access to the countryside.\n\nHe said:\"That's the thing that holds us back from being a billion pound industry.\n\n'Natural environment'\n\n\"If you go to any other country, they don't have the access restrictions we have. \n\n\"We should have unrestricted access to the natural environment in the same way as they have in Scotland and most other countries.\"\n\nIn January, the British Mountaineering Council called for greater access to the outdoors in Wales ahead of a Welsh government review on laws.\n\nBut the Country Landowners Association said it had concerns about the cost of\"unfettered access\".\n\nA Welsh government green paper on the review is due to be published soon.\n\nThe survey of Wales' outdoor activity providers had 296 responses but incomplete responses and those outside the scope of the survey reduced this to 93.\n\nThe report found the total expenditure in Wales' on outdoor activity tourism was estimated at \u00a3601m.\n\nIn 2010, Scottish Natural Heritage said the value to the Scottish economy of nature-based tourism was \u00a31.4bn a year.\nTL;DR: The outdoor activities sector is worth almost half a billion pounds to the Welsh economy, new figures show.\n\nArticle: By Mark SavageMusic reporter\n\nThe drummer's injury occurred at the base of his neck, and will require several months rest and treatment.\n\n\"I'm absolutely gutted that we've had to postpone the tour,\"he said in a statement to fans.\n\n\"I've honestly tried everything to make it work, but I'd never want to do a tour where I wouldn't be able to give you the 110% performance you deserve.\"\n\nThe tour, which was due to kick off in June, has already been rescheduled for September.\n\nSinger Tom Fletcher said:\"Sorry we've had to move the tour.

The group was formed in 1980 to show a softer side to the anti-apartheid struggle, and win support in different parts of the world. \n\nThe white-minority National Party government regarded Gwangwa's musical and cultural activism as a big enough threat for their security forces to bomb his house in Botswana in 1985. Fortunately the musician and the other occupants were elsewhere.\n\nHis commitment to the liberation struggle together with his exceptional musical talent saw Gwangwa being awarded South Africa's Order of Ikhamanga in Gold - the nation's highest honour. \n\nThe citation for the national order, which he received in 2010, recalls how he\"enthralled the world with his artistry as a composer and all-round creative genius. For more than 30 years he travelled the world as an exile collecting accolades wherever he went\". \n\n'A mirror for society'\n\nPaying tribute to Jonas Gwangwa, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that he\"ascends to our great orchestra of musical ancestors, whose creative genius and dedication to the freedom of all South Africans inspired millions in our country - and mobilised the international community against the apartheid system\".\n\nFormer president Thabo Mbeki paid his own tribute via his foundation:\"Bra JG, as he was affectionately known, understood the potent combination of culture and the arts as an effective instrument for national liberation from the beginning of his career.\n\n\"Together with others of his generation, Gwangwa harnessed the enthralling capacity of music not just to entertain, but also to hold up the mirror to society and bare the evil soul of the Apartheid regime to the world.\"\n\nA young Gwangwa delighted audiences in Johannesburg's vibrant multi-racial cultural hub of Sophiatown, until it became illegal for black people to congregate and the apartheid government censored jazz performances in 1960. \n\nAlong with other leading South African musicians like Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim and Miriam Makeba, Gwangwa went into exile rather than bow to apartheid censorship. \n\nHe rose to worldwide prominence in 1965 performing at a Sound of Africa concert at New York's Carnegie Hall with the likes of Makeba, Masekela, and Letta Mbulu.\n\nIt was the start of an international career that he used in service of the constantly growing struggle against white-minority rule.\n\nIn 1987, alongside English composer George Fenton, Gwangwa composed the score for the film Cry Freedom, earning two Oscar nominations for best original score and song.\n\nHe also received numerous awards at home, including at the South African Music Awards in the jazz category.\n\n'Boy, did he play the trombone'\n\nLike most other exiles Gwangwa returned home in the 1990s. Ike Phaahla, one of the country's leading radio jazz presenters, remembers the musician's first performance back home - at the famous Kippies jazz club in Johannesburg in 1991.  \n\n\"Backstage he regaled us with stories from his time in exile, but boy did he play the trombone that night. \n\n\"He was not only an artist but also an activist and freedom fighter.

He suffered 37 injuries as a result, including the loss of both his legs.\n\nThrough the use of high-tech prosthetics, he is now able to walk. I watched him gradually get up from his wheel chair, crutches in both hands, eyes starring directly in front of him. \n\nHe begins to walk towards me; his artificial limbs allow him to move with ease and comfort, he tells me. His speech is difficult to understand, because of the severe brain injuries he sustained in the attack.\n\nHis mother, Diane Dernie, is concerned about Ben's future once he leaves the forces. Currently the military pays for the prosthetics which experts say are state of the art, and cost tens of thousands of pounds. \n\nBut the NHS takes over the care of veterans who are amputees, and there has been criticism over the quality of the prosthetics which they provide, which are currently a lot cheaper.\n\n\"Budget-orientated\"\n\nDiane said:\"We're always worried that when you're back within the care of the NHS, it's going to be more about the money that's available rather than what the need actually is. \n\n\"And the circumstance will arrive where the NHS has to say, well this is what's available and this is the best we can do, and that may not necessarily be what's required.\"\n\nVince Manley is a former Royal Marine Commando. In 2005, he lost both his legs in a bomb explosion in Baghdad. He used NHS prosthetics for a while, and found them painful at times.\n\nHe said:\"Obviously it's all budget-orientated so it's very basic components and the sockets themselves were bog standard carbon fibre. I didn't know any different at the time, so I just thought everything was going to be uncomfortable for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe government has already acknowledged the problem, and has committed to spending up to \u00a315m over three years on prosthetics for those injured in places like Afghanistan but no longer serving.  \n\nIt says the money, which comes from the Department of Health's contingency fund, will go towards setting up specialist units, and improving the standard of NHS prosthetics so that they are more in line with those available through private clinics.\n\nRobert Shepherd is a physiotherapist, and specialises in prosthetics.  He has worked in the NHS, but now runs a private clinic in Leicester, where he helps patients like Ben find the most suitable artificial limbs.\n\nLimb upgrade promise\n\nHe said that that sum of money is simply not enough.\"If you consider the prosthetics, normally the components have a warrantee of two to three years; it means they need to be replaced every three years.  \n\n\"And if you take that for the number of people that are going to turn up saying I want my higher spec leg, they have to be replaced over and over again, that money is just not going to add up.\"\n\nI put that claim to Dr Andrew Murrison, the MP for South West Wiltshire. He led the government review into NHS prosthetics after concerns from military charities that they are not good enough.  \n\n\"I think people always do say it's not enough,\"he told me.\"I'm confident...  that this is an adequate response to the challenges and we will provide the sort of service that people have been asking for.\"\n\nSince the war started in 2001, 248 service personnel have lost limbs in Afghanistan, according to official figures. But this cash is not just for them, it is for those who have lost limbs in other conflicts too. The government is calling it an interim solution while it figures out what to do in the long term.\n\nSoldiers who lose limbs in combat do receive compensation. In Ben's case, he was awarded more than \u00a3500,000. But his mother says this amount does not cover a lifetime's worth of prosthetics, and the additional expenses of living with a disability.\n\nThe Department of Health told PM that\"servicemen and women who have been injured in the service of their country deserve the best possible care from the NHS, and we are committed to making this available. \n\n\"Since 2 April this year, any veteran who has lost a limb as a result of their time in the armed forces can upgrade their prosthetic limbs to the same standard as those received by serving soldiers. We are also working towards the creation of specialist limb centres for veterans in the NHS, and these will be in place by March 2013.\"\n\nIt is too early to say whether the funding has made a difference. But some veterans fear their replacement limbs will be forgotten or downgraded by future budget cuts as the Afghan war slips into history.\n\nListen to Sima's report on Radio 4's PM programme at 1700 BST on Wednesday.\nTL;DR: Next week, Ben Parkinson will walk 300 metres with the Olympic torch in Doncaster; a task most of us would deem as rather easy. But for the 27-year-old amputee, it is anything but, as PM's Sima Kotecha has been finding out.\n\nArticle: Domestic abuse commissioner Nicole Jacobs fears refuges and other services - which are often run by charities - may run short of cash.\n\nShe is calling on the government to guarantee funding for the organisations as part of the Domestic Abuse Bill.\n\nThe current\"stay at home\"rules do not apply to people fleeing domestic abuse.\n\nThe government did increase funding for domestic abuse services during the first national lockdown last year amid concern over a big rise in violence in the home.\n\nBut Ms Jacobs said long-term funding for services remained\"precarious\"and\"varies from area to area\".\n\nShe added:\"Demands on these services will only increase. These are lean operations with everyone working at full speed.\"\n\nOne in five offences - more than a quarter of a million - recorded by police during and immediately after the first lockdown in England and Wales involved domestic abuse, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nWhat is in the Domestic Abuse Bill?\n\nMs Jacobs, whose role was created by the government last year, is concerned about a similar picture developing this time.\n\nShe said charities had seen a\"big increase\"in calls from neighbours, friends and loved ones worrying about potential victims. \n\nThere have also been reports of perpetrators lying to employers about having Covid symptoms so they could stay at home with their victims.\n\nThis highlights how difficult it may be for people to escape and how vital it is that services like refuges are available, said the commissioner.\n\nLockdown restrictions have severely curtailed people's interactions with teachers and other professional bodies who often play a vital role in spotting cases of suspected abuse. \n\nMs Jacobs called for the Domestic Abuse Bill - set to become law later this year - to include a statutory duty to fund community services, which are said to provide support to around 70% of people experiencing domestic abuse.\n\nThe bill already places a duty on local authorities to help victims of abuse, but does not guarantee additional funding.\nTL;DR: Demand for domestic abuse services is likely to increase further as England heads into another lockdown, a government watchdog has warned.\n\nArticle: By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York\n\nBut the US small business owner is now battling Apple for the right to use a pear in the logo on her recipe app.\n\nIn a legal filing, Apple said the image was too similar to its own logo and would hurt its brand.\n\nMs Monson says the tech giant is simply\"bullying\"and she feels a\"moral obligation\"to fight back.\n\nMore than 43,000 people have already signed the petition she and her husband Russ, owners of the Super Healthy Kids website, created last week to try to pressure the company to back down. \n\n\"This is a real world example of a small business being destroyed by a giant monopoly because they don't have accountability,\"Mr Monson told the BBC.\"That was so frustrating to us that we thought we had to do something. We can't just be the next victim on the list.\"\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment. \n\n'Similar commercial impression'\n\nIn its filing with the US patent and trademark office, the firm says the Monsons' pear logo\"consists of a minimalistic fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind Apple's famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison\". \n\nIt asks regulators to reject the Monsons' trademark application, which the couple first filed in 2017 on behalf of their recipe and meal planning app, Prepear.\n\nMs Monson said the comparison took them by surprise. The shape of the pear and leaf, which they worked on with a designer, was supposed to allude to the letter\"P\"in the app's name, she said. \n\n\"We had no intention or any awareness that it was copying any logo at all,\"she said.\"We thought it was very unique and designed it to be so.\"\n\n\"First we were very surprised and then I would say our second reaction was definitely scared,\"she added.\"Like,'ok where do we go from here? What does this mean?'\"\n\n'You wonder if it's a joke'\n\nWhen the Utah-based couple started planning Prepear five years ago, they envisioned the app as a platform where food bloggers could upload recipes, which subscribers could access to plan meals and create shopping lists.\n\nThey now have about 21,000 monthly active users, including 3,000 customers who pay the annual $59 fee, according to Mr Monson, an accountant by training. The app, along with the Super Health Kids site, supports five staff, including the couple.\n\nMr Monson said he initially thought it was a misunderstanding and the two sides would be able to resolve the dispute amicably. The logo has been approved in other countries, including the UK, without dispute and American patent officials hadn't found a problem, he noted.\n\nAs a final step before approval, the patent office published their application in late 2019 drawing Apple's objection.\n\n\"It just seems so ridiculous on its face,\"he said.\"You wonder if it's a joke.\"\n\nLast week, as it became clear that it was not, the couple spoke out on social media, drawing attention to other instances of Apple's trademark objections and noting that concerns about legal costs had prompted them to let go one of their employees.\n\nTheir story was picked up by iPhone in Canada and has since spread, drawing fresh attention to debates about whether tech giants are abusing their powers.\n\n\"We're honestly overwhelmed by how supportive people have been,\"Mr Monson said.\"It's incredible to see how many people share the same frustration that made us decide to take this public.\"\n\nSome of the people reaching out have offered legal and design help, so Mr Monson said he has no plans to back down in the fight anytime soon.\n\n\"We're going to take it all the way,\"he said.\nTL;DR: When Natalie Monson started her food blog 11 years ago, she didn't expect to end up embroiled in a fight with the world's most valuable company.\n\nArticle: Flight AI191 was flying from the Indian city of Mumbai to Newark in the US.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence said RAF Typhoon fighter jets escorted the aircraft as it made its landing.\n\nAir India confirmed an email came through to Mumbai airport with a bomb threat.\n\nThe airline had initially tweeted about the scare, which has since been deleted, and later told Reuters news agency the threat was a hoax.\n\nA statement from Stansted Airport said the plane, which was carrying 327 passengers, landed at about 10:15 BST and was taken to an isolated part of the airport.\n\nThe plane finally took off for Newark at 21:30 BST.\n\nEarlier, @DinoGoel tweeted to say passengers had been disembarked one by one, frisked and had their bags checked by hand and by sniffer dogs.\n\nHe said they were then put on a bus and taken to the terminal, where they were offered water and snacks.\n\nIn a later tweet, @DinoGoel said he and the rest of the passengers were being moved to Stansted main terminal. \n\nHe said:\"New crew coming from London. In the mean time all passengers have to go thru [sic] security and immigration again.\"\n\nAn RAF spokesman said the Typhoon jets were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort the Air India plane to the airport in Essex.\n\nHe said they were authorised to fly at supersonic speed and across nearby Derbyshire, a sonic boom was heard.\n\nThe noise, which sounds like a thunder-clap, is created when an aircraft travels faster than sound - and it can cause damage to structures.\n\nMultiple calls were made to the police and fire service from people who feared there had been an explosion.\n\nThe emergency services could not explain the cause of the loud bang heard shortly before 10:00 BST until the RAF confirmed it was their Typhoons and apologised for the inconvenience.\n\nEver since the Battle of Britain, RAF aircraft have been ready to respond to any incursion or incident in the air. \n\nToday it's the job of Typhoon jets based at RAF Coningsby, covering the south of the UK, and RAF Lossiemouth to the north. \n\nThe Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) Typhoons are armed with short and medium air-to-air missiles as well as their cannon. \n\nCrews that are on call 24/7 are expected to be in the air within minutes of being scrambled. \n\nThe RAF will first try to make radio contact with the suspect aircraft - whether it's a civilian airliner or a Russian military jet near UK airspace.\n\nIf that fails the pilots will use internationally recognised aviation signals to guide the aircraft. \n\nOnly as a very last resort would any aircraft be shot down. \n\nThat order would have to come from one of a handful of designated ministers, including the prime minister, via the RAF's command bunker at High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire.\n\nIt hasn't happened yet.\nTL;DR: An Air India passenger plane has made a \"precautionary landing\" at Stansted Airport after the airline initially reported a bomb threat.\n\nArticle: The money will cover separate investigations into breaches of US sanctions and foreign exchange trading issues.\n\nIt also covers a \u00a3102.2m fine from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority related to financial crime controls.\n\nThe provision will be included in the bank's results due next week.\n\nThe bank, which is listed in London and Hong Kong, warned last year that continuing investigations by the US and UK regulators could have a\"substantial financial impact\".\n\n\"Standard Chartered's 2018 fourth quarter results will include a provision totalling USD900 million for potential penalties relating to the...

including Yandex's search app - after buying an Android handset or tablet.\n\nIn the past, Microsoft and others have made similar complaints about Android to the European Commission, claiming that the operating system acts as a Trojan horse for Google's services.\n\nLast year, the commission said it would\"probably\"launch a formal investigation into the claims if it did not get an\"adequate\"response from Google. \n\nEU anti-trust watchdogs are already carrying out a separate investigation into Google's search and advertising business.\n\nMarket share drop\n\nYandex said that it had decided to act after three electronics comapnies - Prestigio, Fly and Explay - contacted it between last November and last month to say they were\"no longer able\"to pre-install Yandex's services on their Android devices because of Google's restrictions.\n\nIt said these included a take-it-or-leave-it rule, under which the manufacturers were forced to choose between installing the complete set of Google Mobile Services apps - including Google Play, Gmail, YouTube, Google Translate and Google Drive - and setting Google as the automatic search service, or opting out altogether.\n\nThe Moscow-based company added that Google was\"increasingly\"prohibiting device-makers from pre-installing competitors' services.\n\nA spokesman for Yandex acknowledged that it was possible for customers to subsequently download its own app. But he noted that, unlike in Apple's iOS operating system, users could not later reset the default search service from being Google in their settings menu.\n\nThe spokesman also told the BBC that Yandex's share of searches carried out via Android devices in Russia had fallen -

In 2004, the UK was the only major country not to have controls on migrants coming from Poland and more than 600,000 arrived in Britain. \n\nThis time, he said,  Bulgarians and Romanians would have the choice of many countries including Germany and including places like Italy and Spain where there are already Romanian communities. \n\nMost importantly, the minister tried to shut the door on a proposal that the government should extent the current controls beyond New Year's Day. \n\n\"It simply isn't legally possible,\"he said.\"Treaties would have to be amended. It would not be complicit with treaty obligations.\"\n\nAnd then came the polls. By a huge majority those polled did not want a new round of immigration. Some 85% feared schools and hospitals could not cope. \n\nThe issue touches on sensitive issues like control of borders and who, ultimately, is responsible for the benefits system. The polls reflect a deep mistrust about earlier commitments made by politicians to establish a\"firm control over immigration\".  \n\nWage gulf\n\nAnd then came the hints that the government was examining extending the period before Bulgarians and Romanians would be able to claim benefits. They might have to live in the UK for up to a year before they would qualify.  They would not, for instance, be able to seek the job-seeker's allowance on arrival. \n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove said:\"When it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the EU, we need to look properly at the benefits system here to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute, not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system.\"\n\nSuddenly, there was the prospect of Prime Minister David Cameron defying the EU, for member states are barred from discriminating between their own citizens and migrants from other EU states. To breach that regulation would almost certainly trigger a legal row which would end up before the European Court of Justice.\n\nI was in Bulgaria last week. It is hard to assess the numbers who will migrate, let alone to Britain, but there are plenty of people who say they will make the journey. \n\nIn the end, the discrepancies in wages are too hard to resist. The average annual wage in Bulgaria is about \u00a34,000 compared to \u00a326,000 in the UK. My colleague Emma Jane Kirby found Bulgarian doctors hoping to earn ten times as much in Germany or the UK.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski told me:\"For sure some Bulgarians will try and work in Britain. Most of them will look for proper work rather than taking advantage of the welfare system.\"\n\nBut the fear remains that some immigrants will not look for, or find, regular work.\n\nSo some EU countries are agonising over how to respond to the lifting of travel and work restrictions. The Times reports that 16 German cities have written to Chancellor Angela Merkel saying they cannot cope with the new arrivals and asking for emergency help from the beginning of next year. Some German politicians openly agree with some of the concerns raised in the UK. \n\n\"If Britain wants to enforce its welfare laws better,\"says Peter Wilding, director of the pro-EU lobby group British Influence,\"it has, like the Germans, a wellspring of European goodwill to do so and the allies to push it through\". \n\nDefiance\n\nSo what is to be done? For David Cameron there are no easy choices. To defy the EU would cause more than a ripple within his coalition. Some Liberal Democrats would resent a further row with Brussels.\n\nIn Europe, some countries would see it as another example of the UK's alienation from the European project. It might make re-negotiation  of terms of membership more difficult - but defiance might prove popular with voters.\n\nThis controversy raises wider themes. The freedom to move and work in the EU is regarded as a core achievement. Many have taken advantage of it. \n\nBut times are difficult and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Despite the billions that have been spent on trying to reduce the inequality between countries like Romania and Bulgaria  and the rest of the EU, the standards of living are very different. It reveals just how difficult it is to bring the economies of all 28 EU members closer together.\n\nIt is also a period of tension between what governments want and their EU obligations. Yesterday the streets of Paris were filled with riding enthusiasts and their horses protesting against an increase sales tax on riding schools, imposed via a European Commission directive with the backing of the European Court of Justice. \n\nIt has triggered the anger of the 2.3 million people who ride. The French government says it is sympathetic to the protests and may try to renegotiate the directive but, in the short term, it will not defy Brussels. \n\nDefiance is a big step, and the UK may have a significant number of allies if it seeks temporary relief from the lifting of restrictions on 1 January.\nTL;DR: Last week the UK's Immigration Minister Mark Harper tried to calm the rising agitation about migrants arriving in the New Year from Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nArticle: By Paul MartinBBC News\n\nAlex Carpanini, who runs nine adult gaming centres (AGCs) in Wales in seven different local authority areas, was given the money in April.\n\nBut last week Bridgend council asked for the money back, saying the business is not eligible.\n\nThe council says it is following Welsh Government guidance.\n\nAGCs are arcades with betting machines that have a maximum \u00a32 stake.\n\nMr Carpanini employs more than 40 staff who have all been furloughed and says he is\"hoping we can make it through\"the pandemic.\n\nHe received an email from Bridgend council on 9 June saying:\"I must advise you that the grant of \u00a325,000 paid into your bank account in April 2020 was paid in error, as businesses such as yours do not meet the criteria set by the Welsh Government.\n\n\"Please can you arrange for the sum of \u00a325,000 to be paid back to your business rates account by return.\"\n\nOther than Bridgend, three councils have given him grants, one turned him down, one hasn't responded, and one has paid out for one arcade in its area but not for another.\n\nMr Carpanini said the variation is\"crazy.\"\n\n\"Just be consistent: have clarity across Wales, instead of a postcode lottery depending on which local authority you're under.\"\n\nIndustry representatives are frustrated that decisions on grants for AGCs are varying from council to council.\n\nThe trade body Bacta has been lobbying the Welsh Government to give clearer guidance to councils that arcades are eligible for the grant, as is the case in the rest of the UK.\n\nRichard Case from Bacta says the businesses are being treated\"completely unfairly.\"\n\n\"Having been told by government to shut we should be receiving support.\"\n\nThe Welsh Government said it was for councils to decide if a business is\"broadly similar\"to those listed as eligible for the grant.\n\nIts guidance states that\"casinos and gambling clubs\"are excluded.\n\nSome councils seem to have decided that some amusement arcades fall into that category, while others have not.\n\nBridgend council said:\"National guidance on business support grants has been continually updated throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"After Welsh Government provided further clarification concerning the conditions under which grants to gambling establishments would be applicable, we checked our system and found that out of 2,321 paid grants totalling more than \u00a328m, two would not have been approved had the clarification regarding these types of premises previously been in place.\n\n\"We have written to the businesses concerned to explain this, and have invited them to discuss the matter further with us.\"\n\nMr Carpanini says he has not heard from the council since the initial request to repay.\n\n'Cause concern'\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says variation from council to council in how the grants are being awarded is creating uncertainty and a sense of unfairness, and that it's a problem in other sectors too, such as children's play centres.\n\nBen Cottam from the FSB said a council asking a business to repay was\"very concerning.\"\n\n\"I think also this will cause concern for other businesses that funding could be clawed back in their case.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said:\"This scheme and the guidance issued to local authorities does not stipulate the exclusion of amusement arcades.\n\n\"Whilst it is not possible to list all the various property uses that exist, local authorities should determine whether particular properties not listed are broadly similar to those listed and to therefore consider them eligible.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, said:\"Local authorities have made nearly 58,000 awards and distributed just over \u00a3700m to support businesses and keep local economies afloat. \n\n\"Welsh Government guidance has been closely followed and consistently applied by local authorities.\"\nTL;DR: An amusement arcade owner has been asked to repay a \u00a325,000 coronavirus

government to withdraw US investments.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said he will veto the bill, but a Democratic senator is\"confident\"he'd be overruled.\n\nIf it became law the legislation would allow victims' families to sue any member of the government of Saudi Arabia thought to have played a role in any element of the attack.\n\nSaudi Arabia denies any involvement in the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\nFifteen out of the nineteen hijackers in 2001 were Saudi citizens.\n\nIn 2004 the 9/11 Commission Report found\"no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organisation\".\n\nA White House spokesman said President Obama had serious concerns about the bill, and it was difficult to imagine he would sign it into law. \n\nIt was sponsored by Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas and is expected to be passed by the House of Representatives as well.\n\nAnalysis - Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington\n\nThe 9/11 bill puts Congress on a collision course with the Obama administration, which has lobbied intensely against it. \n\nThe White House argues the legislation would remove the sovereign immunity that prevents lawsuits against governments, and could expose Americans to a legal backlash overseas.  \n\nFor Congress, however, this is about fighting terrorism and pursuing justice for victims, and there is unusual bipartisan support for the bill. Some of its most outspoken supporters are Democrats who are confident that Congress has the necessary two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto. \n\nThere is no evidence to support claims that Saudi officials provided financial support to the hijackers, although some believe a classified section of the report into the 9/11 attacks might show otherwise. \n\nBut Congress is also playing to the strong emotions triggered by this dispute - the relative of a victim recently told the New York Times it was\"stunning\"to think the government would back the Saudis over its citizens. One suspects many Americans might agree.\n\nSenator Schumer said:\"Today the Senate has spoken loudly and unanimously that the families of the victims of terror attacks should be able to hold the perpetrators even if it's a country a nation accountable.\n\n\"It will serve as a deterrent and warning to any other nation who assists in terror attacks against American.\"\n\nHe said he was confident the bill would be passed by a large margin in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n\nOn Tuesday, Saudi Arabia denied it had threatened to sell its US bonds, which would pull billions of dollars from the US economy. \n\n\"We said that a law like this is going to cause investor confidence to shrink,\"Foreign Minister Ahmed Al-Jubeir said while attending a conference in Geneva.\"Not just for Saudi Arabia, but for everybody\".\n\nLast year an inmate in US custody, Zacarias Moussaoui, claimed that a Saudi prince had helped finance the attack that flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Virginia.\n\nA fourth plane crashed into an empty field in western Pennsylvania.\n\nSaudi Arabia had rejected the accusation from a\"deranged criminal\"with no credibility.\nTL;DR: A bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government has passed a key hurdle in the US Senate.\n\nArticle: The 16-year-old was close to a bus stop on St Vincent Street on Tuesday night when he was shot, West Midlands Police said.\n\nThe victim was seriously hurt but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.\n\nThere were a number of cars around at the time and police have appealed for anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.\n\nThe suspects were in a dark-coloured vehicle.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Yet she's been utterly silent on this since.\n\n\"Unless she acts, people will rightly conclude that the SNP promised one thing before an election, only to bury that promise after it.\"\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives want 10% of all health funding to go to GPs by the end of the decade.\n\nMr Cameron spoke out as the RCGP warned the UK could have a shortfall of almost 10,000 GPs by 2020 - forecasting a deficit of 9,940 full-time posts across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis could leave 594 GP surgeries at risk of closure, the organisation said.\n\nIt is calling on the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to come up with plans to boost the number of GPs in their areas, pointing to the NHS England plan which aims to recruit 5,000 family doctors and an additional 5,000 other members of staff for surgeries.\n\nDr Miles Mack, chairman of RCGP Scotland, said GPs were the\"cornerstone\"of the NHS.\n\nHe said:\"Scotland needs hundreds more GPs and it needs them as soon as possible.\n\n\"The first minister has said that the percentage share of NHS Scotland funding general practice should receive should be increased.\n\n\"With that commitment expected to come to fruition in the coming draft budget, now is the time to become a GP.\"\n\nTraining places\n\nA spokesman for the first minister said:\"We will take no lectures from the Tories on this issue.\n\n\"Scotland already has the highest number of GPs per head in the UK - and the number has risen to an all-time high under the SNP, while we have increased the number of new training places for GPs by 100 across Scotland this year alone.\n\n\"That solid track record of delivery is in stark contrast with the chaotic situation under the Tories in England, where the NHS has been gripped by unprecedented strike action from junior doctors.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that the Scottish government was\"continuously looking\"at how it could improve primary care against a backdrop of\"continued budget pressures coming from Westminster\".\n\nScottish Labour said the SNP could not continue to\"ignore the GP crisis\", which it said was the result of a \u00a31bn funding cut to primary care.\n\nAnd the Scottish Liberal Democrats said it had\"warned the government time and again that primary care services in Scotland are in trouble\".\nTL;DR: A warning Scotland faces a shortfall of 830 family doctors has sparked fresh calls for Nicola Sturgeon to tackle the GP \"crisis\".\n\nArticle: Kendray Street bridge is the first structure to be knocked down to allow for the redevelopment, which includes a new town square, library and a refurbished market.\n\nA\"pulverising-chewing machine\"is dismantling the bridge\"bit by bit\", the town council says.\n\nCrowds gathered to watch as a firework display marked the start of the work.\n\nCouncillor Roy Miller said:\"This is a really exciting development in our plans to create a better Barnsley. \n\n\"We're creating a better town centre to attract more visitors, create more jobs, and make Barnsley a better place to live, work and visit.\"\n\nConcrete debris from the demolition will be\"100% recycled into construction aggregate for re-use in and around Barnsley\", the local authority says. \n\nThe council previously said the project would not affect existing budgets but would be paid for through\"recent asset sales and borrowing\".\n\nA new landscaped square is due to be finished next year and the revamped market hall, shopping boulevard and new central library are set to be completed in early 2017.\nTL;DR: Work has started to demolish a 30-year-old bridge in Barnsley in preparation for a \u00a341m revamp of the town centre.\n\nArticle: By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News\n\nWheat has been engineered with a gene from a peppermint plant so that it emits a particular pheromone.\n\nThe smell is the alarm signal given off by aphids to warn of an attack by predators.\n\nThe researchers hope that this will act as a\"no parking sign\"to keep the pests at bay without needing insecticide.\n\nThis is the first trial of a plant deliberately modified to use pheromones to ward off pests.\n\nThe work is taking place at Rothamsted Research, the plant science centre in Hertfordshire.\n\nEight plots of land - each six metres by 6m - have been planted with the GM wheat in the past few days.\n\nAphids are one of the major threats to the cultivation of wheat in the UK and other countries.\n\nProfessor Maurice Moloney, director of Rothamsted Research, has described the insects as a\"ten billion dollar problem\".\n\n'Proven' technique\n\nThe idea of creating a variety of wheat that could use smell to repel insects was first mooted in 1985.\n\nAccording to Professor John Pickett, Rothamsted's scientific leader on chemical ecology, tests have proved the technique in the lab.\n\n\"The aim is to use natural processes instead of pesticides and address the public's concerns about pesticide use,\"he said.\n\nThe trials are being conducted behind security fencing to keep out animals and to guard against environmental protestors.\n\nOne set of wheat in the experiment is fitted with the peppermint gene only; another set has also been engineered with a synthetic gene.\n\nThe goal is to see if the plants give off a highly pure version of the pheromone, known as A-Farnesene.\n\nExperiments have shown that the aphids' sense of smell is highly sensitive; the insects will not react if they suspect the pheromone has been released by a plant.\n\nA further aim is to see if the pheromone attracts the aphids' main predator, the tiny parasitic wasp.\n\nNegative publicity\n\nLab tests show that the smell has the twin effect of repelling aphids and luring the wasps.\n\nOne possible risk, raised during a briefing, is that the pests are driven from the GM wheat on to neighbouring crops.\n\nThe researchers say that existing wheat fields are protected by pesticides and wild plants have their own defence mechanisms.\n\nThe scientists are hoping that GM plants which cut insecticide use will help gain support for this controversial technology.\n\nThe science suffered a setback a decade ago amid negative publicity and public nervousness about GM food.\n\nBritain's major supermarket chains do not stock GM food and approval for GM crops has to be given by the European Union.\n\nTrials like this one, which are purely for research, can be authorised by national governments.\n\nThe widespread view among plant scientists is that the challenge of feeding a global population of seven billion requires genetic modification.\n\nBut they face a struggle to win over retailers and politicians not just in Britain but in the EU as well.\nTL;DR: The first experiments with plants genetically modified to repel aphids are under way in the UK.\n\nArticle: By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter\n\nThe band take fifth place on the Sound of 2018 list, which has been compiled using tips from 173 music experts, including critics, DJs and musicians.\n\nWe're revealing one artist from the top five every day this week, with the winner to be announced on Friday.\n\nA longlist of 16 acts was published in November.\n\nPale Waves are led by singer Heather Baron-Gracie and drummer Ciara Doran, who became soulmates as well as bandmates after meeting on the first day of university in Manchester four years ago.\n\nSince that fateful day, they've built a fanbase thanks to songs filled with melodrama, sadness and longing, dressed up with jangly hooks and catchy choruses.\n\nThey've been helped by fellow indie heroes The 1975, who have produced their songs and taken them on tour in the US.\n\nYou met at uni - but you\"met\"online before that, didn't you?\n\nHeather: There was this big group chat on Facebook and everyone was metalhead boys. And then Ciara popped up like an angel and caught my attention straight away.\n\nThen we moved to Manchester, and that day, a few hours later, we met up and have spent every day together so far.\n\nCiara: I feel like we've known each other a lot longer.\n\nHeather: We stayed up till 5am pretty much every night just listening to music and talking about everything.  We knew everything about each other within\u2026\n\nCiara:...seven days.\n\nHeather: I've never connected with such a person before.\n\nWhat did you do in Fresher's Week?\n\nHeather: We didn't go to a lot of Fresher's events. \n\nCiara: The first night, we went to [Manchester venue] Sound Control and Heather passed out and I had to take her back.\n\nHeather: I was a bit tired. And drunk. You took care of me straight away, though, didn't you?\n\nWhat did you study at uni?\n\nBoth: Music\n\nCiara: But it was a terrible uni. That was just a way of us meeting.\n\nHeather: We finished it for our parents and that's it. Outside is where we came to life. If anything, going into that building just sucked the life out of me. You can't teach someone how to write a song. It's within you.\n\nCiara: They didn't even like us anyway. They like us now.\n\nHeather: Yeah, they love us now. It's like dumping someone and then, when they get a bit popular, you're like,\"Oh, I want you back!\", posting loads of pictures online about you.\n\nYou have a flat in Manchester, don't you?\n\nHeather: We did. Apartment 319. That was our first place together. But when we started getting really busy we moved out of there and just made a little base in Ciara's parents' house because we were never home. \n\nWhat do your parents think of their house being the Pale Waves HQ?\n\nCiara: They love it. They're always like,\"Have you got any new music to show us?\"They're always the first people to hear the new music. All our families are really supportive, which is really cool.\n\nIs there much of Manchester in your music?\n\nCiara: People ask that and I don't know. We definitely don't sound like The Courteeners or Blossoms but I don't think our music needs to sound like it's from anywhere. We want it to sound like it's from a new world.\n\nWhat did The 1975 see in you?\n\nCiara: Jamie, our manager, played them Television Romance and There's A Honey and they loved the songs. [The 1975 singer] Matty said he wished that Television Romance was his song, so he wanted to have some involvement.\n\nWhat does their production bring to your sound?\n\nCiara: They enhanced our sound. They took what we had and made it sonically bigger.\n\nHeather: They're really good at listening to something and picking out what it needs.\n\nCiara: A lot of people assume that they write the songs but they didn't. It's a bit annoying that people are undermining us that much.\n\nHeather: People are just silly these days. Like they've got time to be writing songs for other bands. \n\nHow was it touring the US with them?\n\nHeather: It was wild. We went from playing Ireland, when there were about 10 people there, to playing Texas, the first time ever in the States, playing to 8,000 people. That was absolutely manic.\n\nCiara: You don't really prepare for that. But now we're fine. We can do anything now.\n\nYou've said listening to your album will be like stepping into\"Heather's World\"- what will it be like?\n\nHeather: The songs we have out now are very influenced by romance. The album is me talking about a lot of my darker issues. I talk about a lot of things that go on in my mind rather than in my heart.\n\nWhat types of things?\n\nHeather: I talk about a lot of my insecurities, which I think a lot of people will relate to and will find really comforting. There's a lot of content which I think will strike a chord with people, who will think it's really honest.\n\nWhich song best sums you up as a person?\n\nHeather: Probably a new song. It's called Noises. Ciara's actually got it tattooed on her.\n\n[Ciara rolls up a sleeve to reveal a black heart on her arm, with the words\"My mind makes noises\"written on a white band across the middle] \n\nCiara: It's my favourite lyric. That's the most personal song she's ever written. I love that song. That's all about Heather's world. \n\nHeather: It's about dealing with how you look, you feel, the pressure of everyone else these days telling you how to look, what to say, don't make a wrong move.\n\nIt's about a lot of things and a lot of my issues that have been thrown into one. It's a very, very dramatic song. There's A Honey and Television Romance are like candy floss compared to this.\n\nHeather, I gather you injured your back when you were younger - do you want to talk about that?\n\nHeather: I don't want it to really become a thing.\n\nCiara [to Heather]: But people might get helped by it. But you don't have to talk about it.\n\nHeather: I broke my spine. I had a spinal fusion when I was in high school, so that took me out of the start of high school.\n\nCiara: That's how you got into music.\n\nHeather: I was always into it because my dad's a musician, so when I was younger he was always playing the guitar and encouraging me to play it.\n\nBut when that happened, I was staying in my house and wrote music loads. And ever since that, this is what I want to do. But it does get bad sometimes. I have to take care of it.\n\nHow did you break it?\n\nHeather: It wasn't anything in particular. It just went one day.\n\nCiara: But she wasn't supposed to be able to walk, so the fact that she's the frontwoman of a band is crazy.\n\nHeather: I was on the edge of being paralysed. They caught it in the nick of time. I'm fine.\n\nCiara: She's so stubborn.\n\nHeather: I am a very stubborn person. I wasn't going down without a fight.\n\nCiara: That's basically the start of Pale Waves, because Heather's situation led into music.\n\nHeather: It's worth all that pain.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He was once a dangerous, violent drug user and dealer, covering up painful childhood memories. Until a single moment changed everything.\n\nIt was 10am, in a rough industrial area, far away from his home county of Lancashire. Mick Fleming, in his late 30s, was waiting outside a gym for someone to emerge. Mick was in a stolen car - a dark blue Vauxhall Cavalier - with the engine running. This was going to have to be quick. \n\n\"There was no sun, it was a dull dark day, I knew his routine, everything about him,\"he says.\"He was another drug dealer, just like me.\"\n\nMick was a well-established underworld fixer in the North West of England. He was the man others would ring to clear drug debts, and by the time he got the call it meant someone was heavily in debt to equally dangerous people. They were about to get hurt, and badly.\n\n\"My gun was in a plastic carrier bag, on the passenger seat, wrapped tight. You could see the shape of the gun, no DNA or prints would be left behind. Six bullets, spring loaded, it never fails.\"\n\nHe didn't have to wait long.\n\n\"I watched him walk out of the gym. But this time was different. He had two kids with him, two young children, blonde girls, around five years old.\n\n\"I got out of the car, and walked, my hand reaching into the plastic. But then I looked again at the children, again at their faces, their blonde hair, innocent kids. \n\n\"Then it happened.\"\n\nMick describes in detail seeing a blinding light coming from one of the children's hands.\n\n\"It was white, brilliant white. For 15 seconds I couldn't see,\"he says.\"It was like looking into the sun and I was paralysed by it.\"\n\nMick doesn't know what really happened to him that day, but one thing he is certain of - this was the moment that changed his life forever. \n\n\"I collapsed, then struggled back to the car. I felt sick, I was shaking, sweating, heart beating fast. I could hear my pulse as if it was in my head. I didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n\nAnd then, he says, he pleaded with God to help him. But nothing happened.\n\nThe only thing piercing the silence, he says, was Johnny Cash randomly playing on the radio. The song was Man in Black.\n\n\"I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,\"Cash sang. \n\n\"I felt like I was the Man in Black. By this point in my life, I had been arrested for attempted murder, kidnapping, firearms offences. I wanted to die, I'd had enough.\"\n\nMick took the gun, pressed it to his chin, still wrapped in plastic, and pulled the trigger. \n\nIt didn't fire. \n\n\"I broke down, the tears would not stop falling, and I started to feel sick again. I was retching and I punched and smashed the car radio, my hand started to bleed.\n\n\"In that moment I was seeing myself for who I really was. I hadn't cried for nearly 30 years. The last time I cried like this was when I was 11 years old. Sitting in that car it was like I was crying for him, that child, the boy I was, and the life I could have had.\"\n\nMick was suffering a complete breakdown, his violent past catching up with him, the end of decades of pain.\n\nWhen Ed Thomas met Pastor Mick\n\nWatch: Poverty and the Pandemic: Burnley's Front Line\n\nProducer: Lou Martin\n\nMick was born during England's 1966 World Cup-winning year into a Burnley working-class family. His Dad was a window cleaner, who had contracts to clean factories around the town, and, as Mick describes him, a\"proper Labour-supporting man\". \n\n\"It wasn't poverty, but it wasn't luxury. It was a strict upbringing. We were forced to go to Church, we couldn't step out of line, it was old-school discipline.\"\n\nBut everything changed over two days at the beginning of February 1977. On the first day of the month, Mick was attacked by a stranger in the park on the way to school. He was just 11 years old. \n\n\"I was in turmoil,\"he says.\"I'd been sexually abused, and I couldn't cope.\"\n\nMick realised he needed help, but first he had to tell his Mum and Dad. \n\nHe walked out of his room where he had been crying, went downstairs, and looked his Mum straight in the eye. But what happened next was both cruel and extraordinary. \n\n\"Before I could open my mouth, the front door opened. It was my dad. He shouted,'Your sister is dead.' It was brutal, just so direct. I remember the moment of pure silence, quickly pierced by the screams from my mother, howling like an animal.\"\n\nMick had been very close to his 20-year-old sister Ann. He says she looked out for him, gave him money, and bought him clothes. \n\nAnn, he later discovered, had had a heart attack and died in her father's arms at the doors to Burnley hospital.\n\n\"My dad was a tough man, but this must have been horrific for him. He watched the doctors and nurses trying desperately to resuscitate my sister.\"\n\nMick told me that this was the moment his childhood ended. A life disfigured in 48 hours. \n\n\"Drugs were my solution, and that was my introduction. The next 30 years were hell. Pure hell. I would use any drug, and always alcohol.\"\n\nBut with his dependency came criminality. At just 14 he was dealing drugs. People in Burnley, though, just thought he was self-employed, working out of town. The truth was very different.\n\n\"I was a drug runner and debt collector. I was good at my job. I'd hurt people. I wasn't bothered. I was arrested for murder twice, armed robbery three times, countless firearms offences.\n\n\"I was making crazy money, but there was nothing glamorous about this. I was lost, trying to keep my pain down, hide it. None of it worked.\"\n\nIn the 90s, there were two serious attempts on Mick's life, one a drive-by at traffic lights, the other a home invasion that went wrong. \n\n\"Criminality was my world. I didn't know how to work in a factory - I couldn't be normal. I'd see people going to work with sandwich boxes and I didn't want that. I wanted to stand out. \n\n\"Drugs were a constant around me - my best friend died from a drinking session aged 16. He choked on his own vomit, my other friend suffered a methadone overdose at 17.\n\n\"I became hardened to death. I always believed in God, but I also believed God didn't think too much of me.\"\n\nMick was also leading a double life - he had a wife and three children. But the years of lies took their toll. Mick's mum had to step in to take care of the children, to prevent social services getting involved. \n\nHe says that during this\"horrendous\"time his home was often raided by police looking for drugs and guns.\n\n\"All this destroyed my mental health, too. I started taking more drugs. I was now a very dangerous man collecting debts, hurting people. I never expected to live long - genuinely I always believed I'd die young. I didn't want to live, I didn't know how to change.\"\n\nIt was 2009 when Mick found himself outside that gym with a gun wrapped in plastic. What happened in the car, the call to God for help, the attempt to take his own life, triggered an intervention by the authorities.\n\n\"Within 24 hours, I was sectioned under The Mental Health Act. My new home was Burnley psychiatric unit. I had nothing but the clothes I arrived in.\"\n\nStrangely, Mick says, he felt at home in the unit. The patients made him feel loved and cared for. They gave him things - cigarettes, clothes, trainers. \n\n\"There were schizophrenic people in there who weren't treated, those who self-harmed, really ill people, the most vulnerable alcoholics. But these people were giving me essentials, because they saw I had nothing. I was overwhelmed.\"\n\nIt was here that Mick met Pastor Tony, who used to visit the unit. Together they prayed and talked, and Mick says he began to feel emotions again. He started helping others. It was the end of a troubled life, and the beginning of a new one of hope. \n\nA chance meeting with a tutor at the University of Manchester led to a degree in theology. It was tough at first - without much of an education Mick struggled to read and write, and was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyspraxia. He failed his first year, but with hard work and support from the university, he eventually achieved a 2:1 degree. \n\n\"I never drank or touched a drug again. It wasn't easy, it was horrendous. But it was my path to God - and all the way to 2020 and the pandemic. I had no idea of how much I'd be needed and how once again I'd be overwhelmed by suffering and pain.\"\n\nToday you'll find the man now known as Pastor Mick, with the charity Church on the Street Ministries, in Burnley, with those most in need - the homeless, the drug users, the hungry. During the coronavirus pandemic he's never been needed more. \n\nI met him on a crisp, late November evening in an almost-empty car park in the centre of town. It was only 6pm but it was quiet - a silence we've become used to during lockdowns. \n\nPastor Mick began to talk about the struggles he's witnessed this year.\n\n\"Politicians say that it's a leveller, this coronavirus. It's a lie, because if you're poor you've got no chance,\"he tells me.\n\nAcross a dual carriageway, in the distance, they started to arrive. First the homeless, some carrying their belongings in bin bags. Then the users, from those on heroin to those dependent on alcohol. There were around 20 people here, from their 20s and upwards. \n\nThen more people came - some in cars, most on foot. At least 40 people were here now, of all ages. Many were desperate, huddling around two cars belonging to the volunteers, looking for warmth and food. \n\n\"There's no need to push - there's plenty,\"shouted Kaz, a friend of Pastor Mick's, and a volunteer.\n\nThe boots of two cars opened and the waft of the hot food hits you first. It was hard not to notice the hands grabbing what they could, a slight push and a shove. Some were so in need, their freezing fingers burned as they touched the food, but it didn't stop them and not a single tray was dropped. \n\nIt didn't take long for the hot food to be snapped up. There was more though - pre-prepared food bags for people to take home. At the back of the queue there was a gentle complaint.\"There's no chocolate in mine.\"\"I think they've all got chocolate in brother,\"said Mick.\"Well mine hasn't.\"\"I'm not Asda,\"Pastor Mick retorted with a smile.\n\nMost here were respectful and thankful, but there was also a sense of community. It's hard to believe this is happening in the UK today. \n\nBurnley is one of the most deprived local authority districts in England. What's more, the local council's spending power was reduced at a greater rate than the English average between 2010/11 and 2018/19.\n\nThere's a young couple here who are struggling - she is in a wheelchair, he is her carer. They say they're having difficulties getting food and money to get by.\"A couple of day's food makes a massive difference to us,\"they tell me. \n\nAnother car boot opened, this time it was full of clothes. It was now a more frantic scene as people searched through it. One woman in her 30s told me that she suffered from depression and the pandemic had made it worse.\"If it hadn't been for all these, I'd basically be dead.\"\n\nPastor Mick was approached by a man in tears.\"My foot is white, Pastor Mick, I'm in so much pain,\"he said.\"Don't worry brother, we'll get you sorted.\"Mick guided the man in his 20s to two volunteer nurses, positioned away from the group for privacy.\n\nAfter 25 minutes, the initial rush had calmed.\"The need is absolutely colossal,\"said Mick.\"You've seen people who are working who can't make ends meet tonight. We've got volunteer NHS nurses for those who can't access primary care - some of these guys are sleeping on the concrete.\"\n\nIt was the day after the car park session, and Pastor Mick was in his white van, driving through the hilly mill town's stunning scenery, from the sandstone terraces to the prefab bungalows in the villages on the edge of Burnley. The van was packed with food, bread, biscuits, milk, chocolate. \n\nHis phone never stopped. A 10-year old boy was asking for a freezer on behalf of his mum. Mick was on it. A single parent needed a bed for her child. Mick would sort it.\n\nHe visited around 10 homes - and he does this every day, seven days a week.\n\n\"I go into houses and I sometimes have children ripping the bags open as I am carrying them through the door.\"Pastor Mick's voice started to falter, the emotion was too much.\"And it's not alright that, and it wasn't as bad as that before the virus.\"\n\nNot far from the centre of Burnley, Mick visited the imposing Gothic-style St Matthew's Anglican Church to see Father Alex Frost. They've worked together since the pandemic hit. The room next to the altar is now a makeshift food bank. \n\n\"The level of need here in Burnley at the moment, I think, is unprecedented,\"said Fr Alex. \n\n\"I think the people feel forgotten about. It is about money and numbers, and statistics. We can't rely on a food bank, it doesn't seem right, it doesn't seem modern day Britain. But it is.\"\n\nOnce Mick stocked up his van, he was back on the road.\n\nFirst up was Pete, his wife, and son. Debt has crippled them. An issue with the family's benefits meant payday loans and financial crisis.\n\n\"I had to take loans out, so we could eat and pay us bills,\"said Pete.\n\n\"We were in debt for well over a thousand pound. Thanks to Pastor Mick, we've got it down now to two, three hundred pounds. My son suffers from depression from it, and so does my wife.\"\n\nMick was off again. This time to see Viv. She's 55, lives alone and suffered terribly with her mental health during lockdown. \n\n\"I stopped eating for about a week, I just ended up collapsing on my bathroom floor and I were there for, I think, a full day,\"she tells me.\"Hyperthermia had kicked in with everything with me.\"\n\nViv had only recently got out of hospital, and was painfully thin. Mick had got some high-energy nutrition drinks to drop off. \n\nLiving alone during this time has brought back painful memories for Viv - of previous family bereavements.\n\n\"It's like losing all my family again, it's just like brought it all back.\"\n\nAs Mick left, he promised to collect her painkillers prescription later in the day.\"She was trapped inside her house, imagine being trapped inside your own mind. She stopped living,\"he said.\n\nNext was a food parcel for Sheila, in her late 50s. Sheila had been diagnosed with stage-four cancer and was worried about the impact coronavirus had had on her care. \n\n\"I'm supposed to have blood tests done once a month for my cancer count,\"she said.\"But nobody's been and done it [in] six months. And I've just found out that what I thought was two hernias is not, it's one huge hernia. I can't be operated on, because my lungs won't survive it.\"\n\nSheila relies on her 21-year-old granddaughter.\n\n\"I don't want to be a drain on the system that's already dying, because I'm already dying, people need the NHS,\"she said.\n\nThis was just a small insight into one day on Pastor Mick's journey in one town. \n\nAcross England the death rate from all causes, between April and June this year in the most deprived areas of the country, was nearly double that of the least deprived areas.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this, on this scale,'' said Pastor Mick,\"Poverty seems to be hidden, It's underneath the surface that people don't see, they think they do but they don't. \n\nPastor Mick has travelled his own road to Damascus, from a life of crime to being tested everyday by the impact of coronavirus. I wanted to know what motivates him to keep going. \n\n\"What I do today, it's not a penance, it's the complete opposite. It's a privilege to serve the people of Burnley. It's a glorious thing,\"he said.\n\nBut then Mick revealed a staggering story to try and explain why he is at peace with those terrible events of his childhood. \n\nTen years ago, he befriended a homeless alcoholic outside a take away. Mick listened to him, cared for him, helped him to get sober and reunite with his family. The man died two years later but his family was thankful they'd all been together. \n\n\"What I never told him or his family, or the police, was that he was the man who raped me as a child. Why? I knew that I had been forgiven for my past. I didn't do what he had done, but still, terrible things, but I felt forgiven and I didn't want to live in his sin.\"\n\n\"This is why I'm free, I'm not spending my life in torment. It's redemption.\"\n\nWe next found Pastor Mick praying with a woman outside St Matthew's. It was the second week in a row she had been here. She was distressed but finding comfort in Mick's words. \n\nFr Alex explained what had happened.\"She came last Saturday and she broke down and told me her daughter had killed herself.\"\n\nAfterwards, the woman, Sonia, explained the difference Pastor Mick and Fr Alex have made to her life. She said that without them she, too, would have taken her life. \n\nInside St Matthew's, Fr Alex, broke down and sobbed.\"I'm sorry about getting upset. You carry people's burdens, you try to tell them it's alright. It's so upsetting.\"\n\nPastor Mick is proud that it is\"the people of faith who are stepping in and making a massive difference\". \n\nBut Fr Alex wants others to find a longer-term answer to the issues exposed by the coronavirus in places like Burnley.\n\nThe government says it is committed to reducing deprivation and has spent \u00a3100bn on welfare support this year.\n\nThis is the story of Pastor Mick's journey, helping just some of those struggling in Burnley.

without a deal.\n\nArticle: By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent\n\nIt was unveiled on Tuesday at a Co-Operation Ireland reception, attended by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nSpeaking prior to the unveiling, Mr Davidson told the BBC he was very aware of\"the gravity and the responsibility\"involved in painting the monarch.\n\nThe portrait was produced from a sitting at Buckingham Palace in May.\n\n'Most famous'\n\nMr Davidson has painted many significant public figures including politicians, artists, actors and musicians.\n\nHowever, he said that painting the Queen was unique.\n\n\"Here's someone who is perhaps the most famous face in the world and has been so for 63 years,\"he said.\n\n\"I'm bringing everything that I know about painting to it.\n\n\"With anybody I paint, it's a human being in their own right, but with this particular painting I was aware of the gravity and sheer importance and weight which comes with the person I was painting.\"\n\nThe origins of the commission were from the Queen's visit to Northern Ireland in 2012.\n\nDuring a visit to the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Her Majesty shook hands with Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness for the first time.\n\nA number of Mr Davidson's portraits are on display in the theatre, and he was able to show some of them to the monarch.\n\n\"That was at a Co-operation Ireland event,\"the artist said.\n\n\"In the years since then it has just quietly and slowly worked its way to becoming a reality.\"\n\nPrior to the sitting, the artist visited Buckingham Palace to choose a room to paint in.\n\n\"I chose a room where the light was particularly good: the yellow drawing room at the front, which characteristically has been used for most of the royal portraits,\"he recalled.\n\nDuring the subsequent sitting, Mr Davidson said he made about 20 drawings of the Queen, as well as taking a number of photographs.\n\n\"The drawings tend for me to be really important because they capture what I felt,\"he said.\n\n\"The camera just simply takes a frozen frame.\n\n\"The drawings are used for the likeness and the spirit of the time that we spent together.\"\n\n'Irishman's interpretation'\n\nFollowing the sitting, Mr Davidson completed the painting at his studio in County Down.\n\nHe said that he felt his portrait was a\"symbol\"of the Queen's role in advancing a closer relationship between Britain and Ireland.\n\n\"This isn't just my interpretation of the Queen, this is an Irishman's interpretation of the Queen,\"he said.\n\n\"I have witnessed over many years the Queen's actions in advancing healing within the Anglo-Irish relationship.\n\n\"That does inform the weight of the painting and it informs my attitude to it as well.\"\n\n'Scary'\n\nHad he any trepidation about the reaction to such a high-profile portrait?\n\n\"I sometimes wonder why I choose to be in the same room as the person whenever any of the portraits are unveiled,\"he laughs.\n\n\"It's a scary time.\n\n\"But, in some ways, whenever the painting is out of the studio it's out of my hands.\"\n\nThe Queen is a joint patron of Co-operation

were introduced on 23 March.\n\nHowever, the numbers of those who reported experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms declined in subsequent days.\n\nSo far, 30 people of 689 who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland have died.\n\nParticipants in the psychological survey answered questions about their current circumstances, their understanding of Covid-19, what they were doing to cope and their mental health.\n\nOlder respondents were less likely to show increased anxiety or depressive symptoms.\n\nThe study suggested that they were more likely to trust their neighbours and feel they belonged in their neighbourhood.\n\nBy contrast, younger people and those with children were more likely to show higher rates of anxiety or depressive symptoms.\n\nThat was also the case for those living in urban areas, with underlying health conditions or on lower incomes. \n\nParticipants said they trusted social media least to get accurate information about the coronavirus, while health professionals were most trusted.\n\nAbout 30% admitted\"increased purchasing\"of tinned and dried foods and toilet roll.\n\n'Nation is well informed'\n\nThe study also suggested that the majority of people were following public health advice about how to avoid spreading the virus.\n\nFor instance, 95% of respondents said they were washing their hands with soap and water more often.\n\nOver three-quarters (76%) said they believed that\"social distancing\"would help reduce the risk of infection.\n\nHowever, relatively few respondents (17%) said they were wearing face masks.\n\n\"The overall picture that emerges thus far is of a nation that is well informed about Covid-19, taking appropriate health-related actions and psychologically resilient,\"the authors concluded.\n\nThe academics involved in the study will contact the participants regularly to see how their experiences and mental health change as the pandemic progresses.\n\nProf Mark Shevlin, Prof

reacted with fury to news their team, along with the North Koreans, would not receive the special\"Olympic Edition\"Samsung Galaxy Note 8 handsets being given to all other competitors at the Games in South Korea.\n\nReports of the snub have resulted in the South Korean ambassador to Tehran being summoned to the Iranian foreign ministry.  The Iranian prosecutor-general has also ordered that Samsung's boss in Iran be summoned for questioning, and on social media many tech-loving Iranians are now calling for a boycott of Samsung products.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has since clarified that Iranian athletes will receive the Samsung phones.\n\n'Against the Olympics spirit'\n\nThe row began two days before the opening ceremony when the Iranian team queued up at the Samsung stall at the Olympic complex to receive the commemorative phones.\n\nAccording to the head of Iran's National Olympic Committee the team were sent away empty handed because\"UN sanctions\"banned the supply of luxury goods to Iran.\n\nThe incident made headlines in Iran, where both officials and ordinary Iranians saw it as a huge insult and something which could not go unanswered. \n\nBahram Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign minister, described the move as\"immoral and against the Olympic spirit\". \n\nHe said the South Korean ambassador had been told that unless Samsung apologised, trade relations with Iran would suffer.\n\nA day later, Iran's prosecutor-general asked his deputy to summon Samsung's boss in Iran for questioning.  \n\nIt was also widely reported in the Iranian media that Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, was considering changing his own Samsung Galaxy S8 handset for a different model.\n\nNot everyone was satisfied with this response and many Iranians took to Twitter to vent their anger.\n\n\"As our government is useless,\"wrote one,\"we ourselves should show Samsung that humiliating Iranians results in #SamsungBoycott\".  \n\nFor Samsung, this was clearly worrying news.\n\nIran, which has a huge population of young people, is the biggest smartphone market in the Middle East.  It is estimated that some 48 million people in Iran own the devices. And crucially, it's a market that is still growing.\n\nAccording to the Iranian app store, Caf\u00e9 Bazaar, some 51% of Android phones in Iran are made by Samsung, underlying the country's importance for the electronics giant.\n\nPossibly sensing a business opportunity, Samsung's South Korean rival, LG, was quick to intervene in the row, announcing it would give every Iranian athlete competing in the Winter Olympics a top-end smartphone as well as a 55-inch (140cm) TV.\n\nIt's still not clear exactly why the Iranians were denied their phones.\n\nA spokesman for Samsung told BBC Persian it had provided more than 4,000 special edition handsets to the Pyeongchang organising committee and that it was up to the IOC to answer questions about how they were distributed.\n\nThe IOC told BBC Persian that everyone participating in the Games should receive a mobile phone, and that the Iranian team -

Cardiff, Carmarthenshire and Isle of Anglesey.\n\nFace coverings are recommended for children aged 11 and over in communal areas indoors where social distancing is difficult, and on school buses, when schools return next week.\n\nBut the Welsh Government has declined to make their use mandatory, instead instructing individual schools and colleges to make risk assessments.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, secondary school pupils will have to wear masks in corridors and communal areas, as they will in parts of England under local lockdown measures.\n\nThe guidance changed after the World Health Organization (WHO) said those over 12 should wear masks in the same settings as adults.\n\nWhat have unions said?\n\nOn Wednesday headteachers union NAHT Cymru said it was\"unacceptable\"that headteachers had to make the decision, as they were\"not medical experts\".\n\nThere was support for the move from the NEU, but Jonathan Lewis of Unison said:\"Welsh Government should have given clear guidance on this and followed the chief medical officer's recommendation.\n\n\"Leaving it to local authorities and schools to decide is likely to create a great deal of inconsistency throughout Wales.\"\n\nThe announcement\"runs the risk of causing uncertainty and confusion,\"claimed NASUWT's Patrick Roach.\n\n\"If wearing face masks or face coverings in schools is now deemed appropriate in order to safeguard health and safety, then it is difficult to understand why this practice has not been made compulsory.\"\n\nUcac said the decision came\"far too late\".\n\n\"It is extremely disappointing that this announcement comes only two days before the start of term, as our headteachers will have to revisit their risk assessments and all school safety procedures to check the need for the use of face coverings and that they are kept or disposed of correctly,\"it said.\n\n\"It is also disappointing that the Welsh Government has not made the wearing of face coverings compulsory, thereby providing our school leadership teams with a further responsibility.\"\n\nWhat have councils said so far?\n\nSecondary school children in Carmarthenshire will be required to wear face coverings on school transport and in school indoor communal areas.\n\nCardiff Council said it is\"strongly recommending\"that all school staff and mainstream secondary school pupils wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and toilets and all situations where social distancing cannot be observed.\n\nThe council said it will give school staff and secondary school pupil two re-useable masks at the start of term, and will require their use on school transport.\n\nAnglesey council said it also recommended the use of masks where\"social distancing cannot be maintained\"in secondary schools, and by children aged 11 and up on school transport.\n\n'My degree is in history, not biomedical science'\n\nJustin O'Sullivan, head teacher at Cardinal Newman Catholic School in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he was unhappy with the timing of the decision.\n\n\"What we've got now is a situation where heads and local authorities are running around trying to interpret what recommended means, [and make] decisions about where communal areas are safe, and when they're not safe.\n\n\"We're not scientists, we're educators. My degree is in history, it is not in biomedical science or anything like that.\n\n\"It says in the guidance that we should be consulting with parents, unions, stakeholders, governors, and I've got pupils back in next Wednesday.\n\n\"How I'm supposed to do a risk assessment, a comprehensive plan, consult on it, get it out in that time, amazes me.\"\n\nSpeaking as he was in the process of making a risk assessment, he said he was telling parents it was\"almost certain\"that pupils would be asked to wear masks for some part of the school day.\n\nHeadteachers'experts in wellbeing of children'\n\nMs Williams defended the decision, saying masks were not currently necessary\"as community transmission rates remained low\".\n\n\"Things can change very quickly, we may indeed have to move to a situation where we have to mandate,\"she said.\n\nBut she said having pupils wearing face masks in canteens, corridors and communal areas was problematic, with storage issues, and pupils taking them on and off, with concerns that they should not\"create a biohazard around schools\".\n\n\"There are considerations about bullying of children,\"she said.\n\n\"Some children a face covering will not be suitable for, perhaps for personal medical reasons that maybe the rest of the school or their school mates are not aware of at the time.\"\n\nMs Williams said schools should get pupils to wear them if they could not maintain social-distancing in corridors and stop pupils\"bumping into each other\".\n\nBut the minister argued headteachers were the right people to make the decision, as they were\"experts in the health and wellbeing and education of our children\"and the government guidance was\"very clear\".\n\n\"Welsh education is incredibly diverse, each and every one of our secondary schools finds themselves in a very different position, and it is impossible at this stage, with transmission rates low to have a blanket decision,\"she said.\n\n\"I believe we are much more likely to have a greater compliance and to use face coverings successfully if we allow those people on the ground to make the decisions.\"\n\nDuring the interview on BBC Radio Wales, Ms Williams said face coverings\"can be made at home, out of material or purchased\".\n\nNAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said it\"beggars belief to hear ministers talk about making their own masks\"when the Welsh Government's website said many home made masks\"offer little or no protection\".\n\n\"If we are receiving mixed messages on this from government then how are headteachers supposed to make informed decisions?\"\n\nThe WHO recommends three-ply coverings.\n\nEnsuring the correct masks are worn would mean they need to be supplied, Mrs Doel added, calling for the government to step in.\n\n\"The cost implications alone of such a measure will be significant, assuming they are going to be available.\"\n\n'Children don't need added worry'\n\nMother-of-three Ceri Reed said that she feared that if cases rose in certain communities schools\"would be hung out to dry\".\n\n\"It's a national crisis, it requires a national approach,\"she said.\n\nMs Reed, from Parents' Voices in Wales, said she wanted to see a blanket approach but with an exception for individual pupils who may have additional needs or mental health issues, who may find it hard.\n\n\"Many children will have had some trauma and bereavement during the lockdown and they do not need this added worry of the infection transmission sitting next to a peer in class,\"she said.\n\nWhat has Plaid Cymru said?\n\nPlaid Cymru's leader is calling on the first minister to withdraw guidance issued to schools on facing coverings and\"re-issue clear directions\".\n\nIn a letter to Mark Drakeford, Mr Price said minsters'\"hands off approach\"to the matter\"will mean that individual schools and individual local authorities will be left on their own\".\n\n\"This seems to me to be incompatible with the partnership approach -

The video has had over 800,000 views and over 3,000 comments on YouTube.\n\nAl-Hathlool also documented her journey on Twitter, saying\"follow me to find out what will happen at the border\". Arriving at the border with Saudi Arabia, she live-tweeted the moment when she was stopped by a Saudi customs officer at the border. Straightaway, Al-Hathlool's name in Arabic became an international social trend. \n\nShe tweeted that officials had taken aside, and were making phone call after phone call. Hours went by. Her friend and UAE-based Saudi journalist Maysaa Al-Amoudi, drove to the border from Dubai to bring her supplies.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours spent on the border of Saudi,\"Al-Hathlool tweeted to her 233,000 followers on 2 December.\"They won't give me back my passport and they won't let me pass through and no word from the Ministry of Interior. Complete silence from all the officials\".\n\nSince then, her timeline has been silent.\n\nAn Arabic hashtag that translates to\"Lujain Al-Hathlool arrested\"has been tweeted nearly 500,000 times, although BBC Trending was not able to confirm the arrest with the Saudi authorities.\n\nBut a statement by Human Rights Watch says activists have told the organisation that both Al-Hathlool and Al-Amoudi have been detained and it is calling on the Saudi authorities to release the two women. Al-Hathlool's husband and family have not been able to reach her either, Saudi blogger Abdullah Al Dayhailan told BBC Trending.\n\nThe campaign calling for Saudi women's right to drive has gathered global support, but the topic remains a contentious issue inside the kingdom and the online debate is just as divided. \n\nMany of those who oppose female drivers saw that Al-Hathlool's action showed contempt for state authority and disrespect towards Saudi culture.\"Regardless of what we think of women driving, what Lujain is doing is like child's play, she did not respect her society or her customs\"one Saudi man tweeted.\n\n\"She knew darn well that by breaking the rules she would face some consequences,\"another man commented.\n\nBut some Saudi men have expressed support for Al-Hathlool and women's right to drive.\"Lujain is on the border not because she has drugs in her handbag or because she's carrying a bomb but, no it's more dangerous than that\u2026she's driving a car,\"tweeted one, with a sense of irony.\n\nOthers who have joined the debate suggested that Al-Hathlool is not actually breaking the law because she is driving with an Emarati licence that allows drivers to drive in any Gulf Cooperation Council country, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlthough there is no clear law in Saudi Arabia which bans women from driving, Al-Hathlool's legal standing is uncertain, says blogger Al Dayhailan.\n\n\"Although a religious fatwa is not legally-binding, it is still treated as such\"he said.\n\nReporting by Mai Noman\n\nYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending\n\nAll our stories are at bbc.com/trending\nTL;DR: The name of a woman who live-tweeted her attempt to drive across the Saudi Arabian border has become an international trend, as rumours of her arrest circulate online.\n\nArticle: By Jon Manel iPM, BBC Radio 4\n\nIt was shortly after lunch when Elsie Frost said goodbye to her father, Arthur.

She had been asked to help teach a group of younger children how to sail. \n\nIn fact, for Elsie Frost, everything must have seemed rather special at that time.  She had some good friends, had just become a member of the local youth club and had been chosen to be the next head girl at her school. Life was getting really good.\n\nElsie was wearing a yellow woollen sweater, a white blouse and printed cotton skirt. \n\nBefore leaving her family's semi-detatched home in Wakefield, she sat down to put on her brand new pair of shoes. \n\nMaybe she checked outside to see if it was cold because she also wrapped herself up in her favourite red, quilted anorak, which had been bought for her by an aunt. Her sailing clothes were in a duffle bag, which she carried over her shoulder.   \n\nPeople who knew her were later to say that she had seemed very happy.\n\nSeven hours later, Elsie Frost's body was lying in Wakefield Public Mortuary being examined by a pathologist. Her white blouse, yellow sweater and favourite red coat were soaked in blood. She had been stabbed several times. \n\nHer father had to identify her body. It was Saturday 9 October 1965.\n\nElsie's murder dominated the headlines. By the following morning, newspaper journalists had managed to track down her elder sister Anne. She was 18 and was living a few miles away with her husband and son. \n\nBy then, Anne's parents were in her house. They had been sedated and were lying down in her bedroom. Some of the reporters were on the\"verge of aggressiveness\", Anne recalls. Had a policewoman not been with her, she adds, she would not have been able to cope. \n\nElsie's younger brother, Colin, had first been taken to stay with some neighbours and then to an uncle's house. He was six years old. He remembers still being up on the Monday night when ITN News came on. The first image he saw was Elsie's face. His uncle leapt out of his chair, scooped him up and\"zoomed\"him up the stairs. Colin has no memory of the time after that point. \n\nThe police investigation was huge. Scotland Yard detectives were drafted in to help the local forces in Yorkshire. According to a senior police officer at the time, thousands of people were interviewed and more than 1,200 written statements were taken. \n\nFour hundred people, who lived within a quarter of a mile of the murder, were traced and their movements checked. A large number of knives were taken and examined but it was not thought that the murder weapon was among them.  \n\nThe police were unable to establish any\"apparent reason or motive for the attack\"and did not know whether\"she was the intended victim or merely passing at the time\".  No one was traced\"with the slightest animosity against the girl\". There was no evidence of a sexual assault and no sign of her having been robbed. \n\nNo-one was ever convicted of her murder.\n\nPrecisely 49 years and 14 days later, Elsie's sister Anne sat down at her computer and typed an email to the BBC. She wrote:\"Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the murder of my 14-year-old sister. The perpetrator has never been brought to justice and I feel sad about that.\" \n\nAnne's sadness had not lessened as the years passed. To some extent, she had to keep her thoughts bottled up because she could not discuss the murder in front of her father. Arthur found it too upsetting.\"He even found it difficult to talk about her and in fact we never did,\"Anne remembers. \n\nArthur could not even bring himself to look at photographs of Elsie. When Anne's parents died - Edith in 1988 and Arthur in 2003 - they both\"went to their graves\u2026 feeling hugely guilty\"because\"they didn't know what had happened to their daughter\", Anne says.  \n\nAnne is determined that she and her brother Colin will not have\"that same kind of guilt that mum and dad had\".\n\nAs a result of the email, Anne and Colin were interviewed on BBC Radio 4's iPM programme. They told their story and that of their murdered sister. The interview lasted around 19 minutes but can be summed up by 13 words spoken by Anne:\n\n\"Why? Why did it happen? On a Saturday afternoon at half past four?\"\n\nOn 11 January 1966, around three months after the murder, an inquest jury thought it knew who had killed Elsie. These days an inquest's role is only to establish certain facts and the cause of a death. In 1966, an inquest could actually accuse a man of murder. And that is what happened at the inquest into the death of Elsie.\n\nOn the morning of 12 January, the Guardian's headline was:\"Coroner sends man for trial on murder charge.\"The Mirror summed it up with the words:\"Elsie: Man accused of murder.\"\n\nThe man was Ian Spencer, who had appeared at the inquest as a witness. The unanimous verdict of the jury was that Elsie Frost had been murdered and\"that there is a prima facie case against Ian Bernard Spencer\"- effectively accusing him of the crime.\n\nDescribed in different reports as a former railway fireman and as a labourer, he was 33 and married with a son. \n\nHe had appeared as a witness at the inquest because he had been in the area of the murder on the same afternoon but he was insistent that he was at home quite some time before Elsie was killed. His wife, mother-in-law and a family friend said they were able to confirm that but they were not called by the coroner to speak at the inquest. \n\nSome of the witnesses who were called contradicted that story and claimed they thought they saw him close to the area where Elsie's body was found.\n\nIan Spencer was committed to face trial. He spent eight weeks and two days in prison. \n\nIn March 1966 he was cleared. A magistrates' court had already concluded there was no case to answer and a judge at the equivalent of the modern crown court instructed the jury to find him\"not guilty\".\n\nElsie's mother Edith told newspapers:\"I know what Mr Spencer and his wife must have suffered, I am glad for their sakes it is over. I am sure they will be as anxious as I am to have the killer found.\" \n\nOne of the people I spoke to over the past few months was Ian Spencer's son, Lee. His father is now in a care home and unable to communicate, after suffering a severe stroke, but Lee was keen to speak on his father's behalf. Lee has a series of his father's notebooks. Opening one at random, it listed places he had been, times and his mileage.\n\nEvery day, every week, every month, year after year, he wrote down everything - the moment he left, the moment he arrived and the moment he returned, wherever he went. \n\nHe did this throughout his working life and continued when he retired.\n\nFinding the log books in his father's house was tough for Lee.\"It's difficult to think that you've got to write this down, day after day,\"he says. \n\n\"He started logging things because of what people had said,\"says Ian Spencer's cousin, Brian Orange.\n\nAt various times during the following years, when there were other murders, the police would arrive at the family home to ask where Lee's father had been when those crimes had been committed. That still angers the family. They believe it was deeply unfair because he had been cleared by two courts. \n\nBrian thinks it is likely that the police visits were one of the reasons his cousin started logging his life.  \n\n\"With the police keeping coming back, he had it in his mind that he would need to be able to say, well, I left home, I went to work. He wanted a safeguard for himself.\"\n\nDespite his acquittal, what happened\"never left him over the last 50 years\", as Lee puts it. \n\nAt every turn in reporting this story, I have found people whose lives have been permanently affected by what happened.\n\nLet us return to Anne's questions. We were left with the knowledge that a teenager had been murdered and a man accused and acquitted of her killing. What though could we find out about the circumstances of Elsie's murder?\n\nI discovered all those details about what Elsie was wearing that day - the red coat, yellow jumper and brand new shoes - in the file from the inquest.\n\nOne of the most difficult days emotionally was when I took Colin to the coroner's office in Wakefield. Staff had kindly retrieved the relevant documents from the archives.  \n\nBefore getting there, Colin told me he would definitely like to know when his sister was killed. The family had thought she died at about 16:30. The file suggests it was earlier than that. \n\nThere is a letter on the coroner's headed paper, which seems to have been typed by or on behalf of the Coroner's Officer, Gerard Browne, at 13:00 on Sunday 10 October 1965. It confirms Elsie's name, address and age and where she was found. \n\nAt the bottom of the page, there are some\"special remarks\". They begin:\"Sir, the deceased girl was found [at] about 4.15pm, Saturday 9 October 1965.\"\n\nFor Colin, knowing this was important. And there was more in the file which was to be new to him. \n\nThe lake - or lagoon - where Elsie was sailing on the afternoon she died was known as the Horbury Sand Quarry. It is close to the River Calder, a canal and some railway lines. \n\nTo return home after sailing, Elsie would most likely have walked on a path which is not there anymore, fairly close to the railway. That area is now totally overgrown. There is another path, which is used now, closer to the canal. \n\nTo reach the other side of the railway, it is believed she headed for what is locally called the\"ABC tunnel\". There are then steps up a steep embankment. There are 26 of them, hence the\"ABC\". \n\nElsie's body was found by a man, Thomas Brown, who had been walking with his young children and their dog. \n\nHe told the inquest:\"When we got to within five or 10 yards of the bottom of the steps, I saw a girl lain there, whom I now know to be Elsie Frost. She was lying with her left arm on the second step and her head was lying on her left arm and her right arm was above her head on the next step. \n\n\"She was crouched up in an awkward position with her legs underneath her body in a kneeling type of position but more on her left hand side. I went up to her and asked her what was wrong and got my hands under her armpits and picked her up. \n\n\"When I spoke to her I did not get any reply. I did not realise she was as badly injured as she was. At this time, my son was at the top of the banking. I tried to persuade the children to go home but they wouldn't.\"\n\nThere are also details in the file about what Elsie was doing within the hour leading up to her death. The event that afternoon at the lagoon was organised by her school's sailing club. The teacher in charge, John Blackburn, told the inquest:\"I beckoned to Elsie and took her out in a boat to give her some instruction, as she had previously got into difficulties when navigating one of the boats. \n\n\"I was out with Elsie Frost in the boat until about five minutes to four.\"\n\nHe explained that Elsie had then helped him to pack the boats away before she left. Other children and another teacher then departed before Blackburn then left at about 16:20. If all the times in the inquest file are accurate, Elsie was killed between about 16:00 and 16:15. \n\nWhile the police never found out what happened during that time, there is a woman who thinks she knows. Her name is Janis Hirst. Back then, her surname was Dixon and she was a friend of Elsie's. \n\n\"When doing my nurse training, I was working at a hospital and got talking about Elsie on a shift we were on. And this nurse had said that she had worked in a hospital where a man had been brought in and he had confessed under drugs to being present at the murder of Elsie. \n\n\"He said that he was in the long grass with another man committing a homosexual act when Elsie had stumbled over them\u2026 and the other man had run off after Elsie and stabbed her. Elsie had caught them in the act and had run off screaming and he jumped Elsie and stabbed her.\"\n\nAccording to Janis, the other nurse said a doctor was also in the room to hear this\"confession\". They did not tell the police because\"whatever a patient tells you is strictly confidential and they couldn't break that confidentiality\"and also because the man was on medication at the time.\n\nThe nurse who Janis said told her all of this died some years ago. Janis says she was given names for the two men but we are not publishing those for obvious legal reasons. She says she is willing to speak to the police.\n\nJanis is confident that what she was told is true but, crucially, she was not there when the supposed confession happened. It is a third-hand story, so one which understandably does have to be treated with a high degree of caution. In legal terms, it would be considered as\"double hearsay\".\n\nI have heard another story along the same lines. According to the former MP for the area, David Hinchliffe, there was a rumour at the time that Elsie had been killed because she had stumbled upon what people described as\"homosexual activity\". It's worth bearing in mind that homosexual acts between men were illegal until 1967.\n\nOf course, when there is any unsolved murder, there will probably always be different stories going around about who might have been responsible. And most will probably not be true.\n\nOne of Anne's fears is that whoever was responsible might have gone on to attack others. A woman called Julie - she only wants us to use her first name - claims something happened to her in the same area nine years later. She was the same age as Elsie had been - 14. \n\n\"We'd bunked off school - me and my brother and his friend and had gone down the quarry,\"she says.\"We'd gone swimming. I was over at the jetty and I got jumped on by a man. He got me in the grass, got on top of me, his hand over my mouth, he slashed my shorts with his knife, he put the knife to my throat. My brother came along and his friend and chased him away.\"\n\nJulie says she did not go to the police\"because I should have been at school. I didn't even tell my mum\". Julie's brother says he remembers there being some kind of incident but does not remember the knife and is short on detail.\n\nIt will be the task of a new police investigation to assess the stories of people like Janis and Julie. It is happening as a result of what we have been doing and it is the first investigation into the murder since the 1960s.\n\n\"The reason why I've taken on this investigation is that I want justice for Elsie,\"says West Yorkshire Police's DCI Elizabeth Belton.\n\nShe is to launch an appeal for information and has not ruled out the possibility that the person responsible might actually come forward to\"clear their conscience and tell me that they've committed the murder and, more importantly, a reason why\".\n\nUnfortunately, DCI Belton will not be able re-examine all the evidence from the time. \n\nWe probably all have an image in our heads, fuelled by all those television dramas we have watched, of vast police storerooms, containing plastic bags full of potentially vital pieces of evidence going back decades. \n\nBut unsurprisingly the police officers in Wakefield in the mid-1960s did not anticipate the amazing scientific advances in DNA testing seen over the subsequent decades. In April 1966, just six months after the murder, some of Elsie's clothing was returned to her father and the rest was destroyed. None of it remains. There are no plastic bags of evidence awaiting the DNA expert. \n\nColin thinks of his sister every time he ties up his shoelaces. It was Elsie who taught him how to do it when he was a little boy. Fifty years after she was killed, she remains on people's minds and not only those of members of her family.\n\nA few weeks ago, when I met Elsie's friend, Janis Hirst, she showed me an old black and white school photograph. Janis is standing in the third row. Elsie is a few places along to her left. Both are grinning. \n\nLike Elsie, Janis was a member of their school's sailing club. In fact, she was meant to have been going sailing with her on the afternoon she died. They had arranged to meet at about 14:00 in order to walk to the lagoon together. But that did not happen. \n\nJanis did not turn up. Her mother was ill and she was sent to the shops instead. Her family did not have a telephone so she was unable to let Elsie know. If they had met up, they would almost certainly have left together too. That has haunted Janis ever since.\n\n\"I remember saying to two detectives who came to our house that if I'd had gone, it might not have happened because there'd have been two of us. And I remember them saying to me:'It could've been that we would have been investigating two deaths. It could've happened to both of you so don't ever think that it was because you weren't there that it happened.'\"\n\nBut that is exactly what has troubled Janis all of these years. As a result, she has written twice to Elsie\"to apologise for not being there that day to walk home with her\". She wrote the first letter when she was 16, the second when she was 40.\n\n\"I think it will always be that doubt in my mind,\"she says.\"There's always that little girl inside of me who thinks I should have been there and it wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nFor Anne and Colin, the last few months have, at times, been very difficult. Anne says there were moments when she\"wanted it all to stop\". She had sleepless nights, and sometimes felt she\"might be sinking underneath it\"but says she needed to do something and that it had been worthwhile. After all, she says,\"this has been on my mind for 50 years\".\n\nAnne's main question remains unanswered. Why did it happen? \n\nThe family does now have the new police investigation to give them the hope that the answers will eventually come but Anne admits there is a big risk that she might be left feeling disappointed.\n\nWhen Colin went with me to the coroner's office in Wakefield, he came away with some of the details he wanted to know and with an image in his head. He says that helped. \n\n\"I feel inside actually closer to Elsie than I was. I can see Elsie's body, how it was dressed, the anorak, the shoes, the skirt, what she was carrying. The only thing that's missing on the body that I am picturing is I don't have her face.\"\n\nBut he says he would not want to see her face in that mental image.\n\nOn 9 October this year, half a century after she was killed, Elsie's life will be remembered in a special service at what used to be the family's local church in Wakefield. \n\nAnne says that when she is sitting in the church, she will be thinking about her sister, all the people who\"should have known her and who haven't known her\"and all those\"who have been affected [like] Janis [and] Mr Spencer. They will all be on my mind\". \n\nOn the same day, a tree will be planted in Elsie's memory at the crematorium where her funeral took place. There will be a plaque with some words her family has written: \n\nElsie is remembered by her family, friends and the community of Wakefield.\n\nForever loved, forever remembered.\n\n7 February 1951 - 9 October 1965.\n\nYou can listen to or download all the reports so far.\n\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.\nTL;DR: Fifty years ago, 14-year-old Elsie Frost was stabbed to death. A BBC investigation has now led to the police resuming their hunt for her killer.\n\nArticle: By Laura DevlinBBC News, East\n\nAn unidentified man was burned to death in what became known as the\"blazing car murder\"in Northamptonshire. His killer Alfred Rouse was hanged.\n\nLast year, a DNA profile for the victim was extracted from archived material. \n\nIt did not prove a match to a suspected victim's descendants, but the work sparked responses from other families.\n\nMoney problems\n\nThe family of William Briggs had been troubled for more than 80 years by fears that the 23-year-old factory worker had been killed by Rouse.\n\nHe disappeared en route to a doctor's appointment in north-west London in 1930, and was never seen again.\n\n\"Philanderer\"Rouse, who may not have known the victim's identity, was having money problems and wanted to fake his own death.\n\nHe hit the man over the head, placed him in his Morris Minor and set it alight in the village of Hardingstone.\n\nHe fled to Cardiff but was later convicted of murder and hanged at Bedford Jail.\n\nMr Briggs' great-great niece recently took up the case with police, which led to the involvement of the University of Leicester.\n\nDr John Bond, senior lecturer in forensic science, and criminology lecturer Dr Lisa Smith searched the Rouse archive and found tissues from the victim's lung and prostate had been stored on slides.\n\nThey were extracted by scientists at Northumbria University, who were able to find a single, uncontaminated male DNA profile.\n\nWhile it did not provide a link to the Briggs family, the team described the scientific breakthrough as\"fantastic\"and are hopeful the victim could still be identified.\n\nHopeful of closure\n\nSeveral families whose\"blazing car\"suspicions have passed from generation to generation have got in touch with the university since its Briggs work featured on BBC's The One Show and the BBC News website\n\nDr Bond and Dr Smith are now sifting through details of missing men who could have been Rouse's victim, along with a mound of family trees and photographs. \n\nThey are yet to decide which claims warrant further investigation, including the possibility of taking cheek tissue samples for DNA profiling.\n\n\"I've had some very interesting conversations with families and it would be wonderful to be able to offer assistance to them through further DNA testing wherever possible,\"said Dr Smith.\n\n\"We are hopeful that we may one day be able to identify this individual and bring some closure to this case.\"\n\nDr Bond said:\"There is still the possibility of identifying the victim if other families with a relative who went missing around November 1930 can be traced.\n\n\"We are really pleased with the response.\"\nTL;DR: Scientists who found a DNA profile of an unknown murder victim from 1930 have heard from more than 10 people who claim he could have been a relative.\n\nArticle: By David ShukmanEnvironment & science correspondent, BBC News\n\nAn advance party has braved freezing temperatures to set up vital equipment and supplies at Lake Ellsworth.\n\nThe project by UK engineers to drill through the two-mile-thick ice-sheet is scheduled for the end of the year.\n\nThe aims are to search for signs of life in the waters and to extract sediments from the lake floor to better understand the past climate. \n\nIt is is one of the most challenging British scientific projects for years. \n\nThe task is so complex that preparations have had to be spread over two Antarctic summer seasons. \n\nIn the first phase a\"tractor train\"has just hauled nearly 70 tonnes of equipment from an ice runway at Union Glacier through the Ellsworth mountains to the lake site. \n\nThe journey of about 250km (155 miles) involved crossing a mix of deep snow and rock-hard ice and took three days. \n\nOnce there, a four-man team stored the equipment and\"winterised\"it to cope with the incredibly low temperatures to come. \n\nWind-blown snow is expected to partially cover the gear but GPS markers fixed to the corners of the site will help locate it again. \n\nThe area around Lake Ellsworth is notorious for its deep cold and constant winds. \n\nLake Ellsworth is one of more than 400 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica and was chosen for the drilling operation because of its relative accessibility. \n\nOne of the advance team, Andy Tait of the British Antarctic Survey, now back in the UK, told me about the sheer difficultly of conditions.\n\n\"The maximum summer temperature is minus 20 and with a wind of something like 30 knots you can imagine the cold.\n\n\"It is really harsh and working there with equipment means you have to use thin gloves - it is really cold.\"\n\nBut the delivery of equipment is just one part of the preparations for the drilling and sampling operation. \n\nKey components are still being manufactured and tested before they can be shipped south. \n\nMost challenging is the complex sampling probe which has been designed to cope with a combination of extremely high pressures and extremely low temperatures. \n\nIt must also be assembled and delivered in conditions of the highest possible sterility.\n\nFor the first time in Antarctic exploration, an investigation is being planned with cleanliness standards higher than those of most surgeries.\n\nBecause one of the key aims is to search for signs of biology in the lake waters - one of the most tantalising questions - all possibility of contamination has to be eliminated. \n\nI watched as one team worked in a clean room at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton.\n\nEach hi-tech component - including the titanium sampling bottles and specially-engineered filters - has to be sterilised.\n\nAnd the final assembly of the 5.5m probe will take place inside a unique\"tent\"accessed by gloved inlets along its sides.\n\nThis November, the second phase of shipments will take place and the operation will begin in earnest.\n\nThe drilling will be carried out by a system using hot water and is expected to take three days.\n\nOnce the bore-hole is open providing access to the lake beneath the ice, the team will then have 24 hours in which to lower the sampling devices.\n\nComputer modelling indicates that the hole will then start to re-freeze making it impossible to use.\n\nThe plan is to first lower the water sampling probe - a process that should take an hour - and then a corer to extract lake sediment. \n\nAccording to Andy Tait, all eyes will be on the weather. Although many stages of the operation can be handled under cover, ideally conditions will be calm when the drilling starts.\n\nThe engineering, the planning, the science are impressively thorough - but Antarctica is the most challenging place on earth in which to work, and outcomes can never be certain.\nTL;DR: An ambitious plan to explore a vast lake trapped beneath the Antarctic ice is a step closer to becoming reality.\n\nArticle: The Dove soap, Marmite and Lipton tea owner said it was exploring what the results could mean for Unilever\"on a broader scale in the future\". \n\nThe trial comes as the pandemic has shaken up work practices.\n\n\"The old ways of working are outdated,\"the firm's New Zealand boss said.\n\nNick Bangs, managing director of Unilever New Zealand, said the goal of the test was to\"measure performance on output not time\".\n\nCovid-19, which has led many of his 81 staff to work remotely, played a\"catalytic role\"in the decision to experiment, he added.\n\n\"Essentially, this is about a holistic understanding of how work and life fit together, and improving mental and physical wellbeing,\"he said. \n\n\"We look forward to sharing the lessons from this trial with other Kiwi businesses, in the hopes of influencing others to reflect on their own ways of working.\"\n\nImproved productivity?\n\nSince the pandemic struck this year, many firms have introduced remote working and more flexible hours, arrangements they say are likely to linger even after concerns about the virus abate. \n\nBut interest in a shorter working week pre-dates the virus.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft Japan reported a sales boost of 40% when it reduced the working week there.

She is worth $9.3bn after a staggering 83% leap in her fortune in just 12 months.  \n\nThe richest self-made woman from outside China is American Diane Hendricks, the co-founder of Wisconsin-based ABC Supply, one of the US's largest distributors of roofing and windows.\n\nChief executive of Vietnamese airline VietJet, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, is the highest new entrant on the list, with Hurun putting her wealth at $2.8bn.\n\nFortunes growing\n\nIndia, which has a similar sized population, has only one woman on the list - Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw who runs pharmaceutical giant Biocon\n\nAlso noticeable from the list is the huge growth in the fortunes of the billionaires in just the past year.\n\nMs Zhou, for example, is worth 45% more than she was in 2017, with another woman on the list, Hong Kong pharmaceuticals executive Zheng Xiangling more than doubling her wealth.\nTL;DR: China has once again dominated a list of global self-made woman billionaires.\n\nArticle: The work to dismantle Greyfriars station will begin in March after a new \u00a37m interchange opens at North Gate. \n\nNorthampton Borough Council said the demolition would open up an important town centre site for redevelopment.\n\nThe work is expected to take 18 months to complete and will also require knocking down a large car park and offices.\n\nDemolition would also enable the possible expansion of the nearby Grosvenor Shopping Centre, which the council is discussing with its owner Legal & General.\n\nThe council said refurbishing the Greyfriars, which costs \u00a3500,000 a year to run, would cost \u00a330m. \n\nFixtures and fittings have already been stripped from the former office complex and parts of the overgrown roof garden have been cut down.\n\nNorthampton Borough Council leader, David Mackintosh, said:\"Greyfriars is beyond repair. \n\n\"It has always been expensive to run and its demolition not only makes sense financially, it will also open up the site for further retail or associated development, breathing new life into this under-used area of the town.\"\nTL;DR: Demolishing Northampton's bus station as part of a plan to redevelop the town centre will cost \u00a34m, a council said.\n\nArticle: The Building Societies Association (BSA) said the eight largest mutuals received 22,441 unfounded claims in the six months to the end of April.\n\nThese were cases in which no payment protection insurance product was ever sold to that customer.\n\nThe BSA said claims management companies needed to be better policed.\n\nIt said that more than half of claims entered by claims management companies to the eight building societies were cases in which a PPI product was never sold in the first place.\n\nPayouts\n\nPPI was sold along with loans and credit cards, wrongly in many cases, to cover repayments if people became ill or lost their jobs.\n\nBanks are in the process of paying out \u00a39bn in compensation to borrowers who were mis-sold PPI.\n\nThe huge payout has spawned an industry devoted to getting hold of a slice of the money. \n\nThat has meant millions of people have been encouraged by claims companies to put in complaints about PPI cover.\n\nClaims companies text or phone people encouraging them to claim, whether or not they were mis-sold a policy or even had one. Then they charge consumers a fee of 25% of any payment, plus VAT.\n\n'Highwaymen'\n\nIn May, the Financial Ombudsman claimed that nearly 6,000 people put in bogus compensation claims to the service last year.\n\nAlthough unjustified complaints made up less than 4% of the total PPI figure, the number concerned the ombudsman.\n\nThe BSA, which argues that mutuals were responsible for a tiny proportion of PPI mis-selling, said that these companies should have to pay a fee to the ombudsman if claims proved to be bogus.\n\n\"If anything, some claims management firms have stepped up their irresponsible, speculative scattergun approach to non-sale claims,\"said Adrian Coles, director general of the FSA.\n\n\"Much stronger action is needed if these companies are to stop misleading consumers and putting a pointless and growing administrative burden on BSA members and the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\n\"Looked at from the perspective of our highly-regulated sector, some claims management companies look remarkably like the modern day equivalent of highwaymen.\"\n\nBanks have also complained about spurious claims. Earlier this year, Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, said one in four claims his bank had received had come from people who had never had a PPI policy with the bank.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice has that bogus claims were taking up\"valuable time, money and resources\"and warned any claims companies putting in numerous incorrect claims that they would be investigated.\n\nHowever, the trade body for claims management companies has always argued that people cannot remember whether they had PPI policies year ago, and so these companies provide a service.\nTL;DR: Building societies say they are being \"bombarded\" with bogus claims for PPI compensation - and the situation is getting worse.\n\nArticle: The Merseyrail Class 777, part of a new fleet, was covered in graffiti while waiting to be transported to Merseyside in a depot in Tonbridge, Kent.\n\nA spokesman for the operator said this\"type of irresponsible behaviour will not be tolerated\".\n\nHe said the graffiti had been reported to British Transport Police.\n\nA picture and video of the train was shared by rail enthusiast Railmen of Kent on Twitter on Monday.\n\nThe spokesman said it had stopped in Kent while en route from the test track in Wildenrath, Germany to Merseyside and the graffiti was now\"being removed at our Kirkdale depot at a cost of thousands of pounds\".\n\nHe said the train would\"then be ready for testing on the Merseyrail network\".\n\n\"We also want to strongly remind graffiti artists that train depots are'live sites' and can be extremely hazardous, so please don\u2019t put your lives at risk by trespassing,\"he added.\n\nThe train is part of a new fleet of Merseyrail trains due to start carrying passengers across Merseyside and parts of Lancashire and Cheshire in the autumn.\n\nThe 52 new trains, made by Swiss company Stadler, are part of a \u00a3500m investment in the network.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

In reality, they abducted Mr Bean on holiday,\"Mr Whelan told the court. \n\nA regular visitor to Russia, who made many friends over the years, Paul Whelan was detained at the Metropol hotel in December. He says he was getting ready for a wedding when an old friend turned up unexpectedly. Moments later, security officers burst in and arrested him for receiving state secrets. \n\nMr Whelan claims the flash drive they found was planted by the friend: an FSB officer he believes betrayed him.\n\nHis lawyers, who are now working their way through several thousand pages of the case files - including surveillance material - say they've still seen nothing to prove his guilt.\n\nHe has become increasingly defiant at his court appearances, a rare few hours out of his prison cell every three months. \n\nThis time he told the BBC the case against him was\"a joke\".\n\n\"This is just a hostage situation,\"he said in court. \n\nThe American, who also holds British, Irish and Canadian passports, suspects he's a victim of plummeting relations between Russia and the West. Some have speculated that Moscow wants to swap him for a Russian prisoner abroad, though the Foreign Ministry here denies that. \n\nIts spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, insists he was caught red-handed.\"We have the facts,\"she said last week.\n\nAt his latest hearing, the ex-Marine requested the prosecutor and judge be replaced for their failure to investigate his claims of ill treatment and a lack of objectivity.\n\nWhen the judge refused, as neither are official grounds for recusal, Mr Whelan displayed mock incredulity. \n\n\"So if the prosecutor were my sister that would be illegal, but human rights violations are fine?'\"he asked. \n\n\"What do you think, Alexei? Shall we go for it?\"he then joked to the chief investigator, wondering whether to request his removal too.\n\n\"It's your right,\"the FSB officer replied in English, with a smile.\n\nBut this high-profile case is a serious matter.\n\nMr Whelan claimed today he had been assaulted by prison staff. His lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said later that a guard had been disciplined following a dispute over the American\"jumping and singing\"during his daily exercise hour.\n\nMore serious still, the espionage charge he's facing carries a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nThe investigation is now complete and his legal team say there is\"lots in their favour\"in the files they've been handed: none of his other Russian friends have said he claimed to be a spy or tried to recruit them.\n\nBut the lawyers say Mr Whelan is going through the papers himself in such detail, his trial is now unlikely to start before Spring.\n\n'I said to him, maybe we should get it over and done with this year? Get you home sooner,' Mr Zherebenkov recalled.'But he wants to read everything, very carefully.'\n\nThe team have talked before of possible\"misunderstandings\"between Mr Whelan and his FSB\"friend\". They've hinted at jokes, maybe lost in translation. His family confirm that he's well known for his\"banter\", as displayed recently in court. \n\nThat may explain Mr Whelan likening himself to the hapless, but harmless, Mr Bean.

So as he was led out of court in handcuffs, he attempted to break the blackout by flinging a copy of the latest court ruling at me down the corridor. It was scooped up by a Western diplomat.

It's the third most Catholic country in Latin America after Paraguay and Mexico.\n\nBut like in many other parts of the region, people are leaving the Catholic Church for Pentecostalism - a Protestant movement. Another reason, says Prof Chesnut, why this visit is important for the Vatican.\n\n'Pope's first miracle'\n\nWhile President Juan Manuel Santos has been widely praised for brokering the Farc peace deal, the second largest guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN) has also been in talks. \n\nOn Monday, the ELN also agreed to a temporary ceasefire that would run from 1 October until the middle of January next year. President Santos called it the Pope's first miracle of his trip.\n\n\"I reckon this is a catalytic effect that the visit of Francis has already had on the Colombian peace process,\"says Jorge Restrepo from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota.\"That is a major achievement and he hasn't yet arrived.\"\n\nOn Tuesday that was followed by an announcement by the Gulf Clan, one of Colombia's most powerful drug gangs, which said it wished to submit itself to justice.\n\nIn a video addressed to Pope Francis, the Gulf Clan leader known as Otoniel said he was\"just another Colombian who longs for peace\"and asked for the pontiff's prayers for stability in the country.\n\nSplits remain\n\nBut Colombia is still divided. Last year, the peace deal was narrowly rejected at first in a referendum. The government and the Farc then agreed a deal several weeks later, which was submitted to Congress rather than the popular vote.\n\nMany hope that the Pope can help bring the country together again. \n\n\"I am sure he will influence people and bring benefits to the country,\"says retired teacher Ancelmo Cuellar, who drove 11 hours to Bogot\u00e1 to see the Pope.\"He'll unite people and help in reconciliation.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees. \n\n\"I don't think he can help heal the divide, I don't think he has that power,\"says Samantha Castellanos, a shop assistant in Bogot\u00e1.\"Politics here is awful and dirty. Promises made by the government in terms of reconciliation are not being fulfilled and never will be in my opinion.\"\n\nThe Pope supported the peace deal but some Colombian bishops were lukewarm about it. \n\n\"I think because of that, Pope Francis is going to try and sidestep an overt endorsement of that peace process itself and speak to the wider need for reconciliation,\"says Prof Chesnut. \n\nVenezuela'failure'\n\nBeyond internal conflict, there is a regional struggle on Colombia's doorstep - that of Venezuela. \n\n\"Obviously this is a visit of great regional implications,\"says Prof Chesnut.\"The great elephant in the room is neighbouring Venezuela where he has really spearheaded efforts to mediate a political settlement there and of course there's been no traction whatsoever,\"says Chesnut. \n\n\"So far Venezuela is his great failure in terms of being the peacemaker.\"\n\nHowever the Pope will meet Venezuelan bishops on Thursday after he lands, the Vatican said.\n\nThe Argentine Pope is on home turf in Latin America. He knows the region well. \n\n\"He will be much more willing to speak freely here because he will be speaking Spanish,\"says Prof Restrepo, who thinks the Pope may refer to Mr Trump and US policy during his trip. \n\n\"The Pope has a very wide view of justice,\"he says.\"It will be a message to humanity.\"\nTL;DR: The slogan of the Pope's visit to Colombia is: \"Let's take the first step.\"\n\nArticle: Northumbria's Police Dog Section kitted out their PDs with the dog boots to protect them on frontline duties.\n\nThey often risk injuring their feet on broken glass, needles or even chemicals, the force explained.\n\nThe dogs received special training to prepare them for wearing the shoes on duty in hazardous environments.\n\nPolice dogs Vinny, Oakley, Pike, Rab, puppy Q and Quinn tried out the shoes during public order training.\n\nRich Davies, a dog trainer at Northumbria Police, said:\"Their paws are quite tough but they do get cut and that can be very painful for the dog and keep them off work for a few days.\n\n\"We regularly train them in how to respond in hostile environments and so this was a great opportunity to get them used to the boots.\"\n\nMost of the dogs have tried them on before, but for newly-qualified PD Quinn it was a first.\n\nHis handler Hayley Raithby said it appeared to take a bit of getting used to:\"We have seen videos where dogs have had shoes on and walked a bit funny and Quinn was no different at the beginning.\n\n\"I don't think he really knew what was going on but he got used to them eventually and that is really important for his development.\n\n\"There will be times that he has to put them on in the future, so these types of training sessions are valuable to prepare him.\"\nTL;DR: Crime-fighting dogs have been fitted with a new piece of kit - specially-made shoes to protect their paws from injury.\n\nArticle: By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\nThe UK's biggest carmaker will be idle for an extra week because of fears of disruption at its car and engine plants at Liverpool, Birmingham and Wolverhampton.\n\nThe shutdown during 8 to 12 April will be in addition to a scheduled closure the following week.\n\nBritain is due to leave the European Union on 29 March.\n\n\"There will be an additional week of production stand-down... due to potential Brexit disruption,\"JLR said in a statement.\n\nThe company, which is cutting jobs because of a steep fall in sales, has previously warned about the impact of Brexit on its ability to source just-in-time components from mainland Europe.\n\nBMW is already planning to close its plant near Oxford for a month after Brexit, while Honda is planning a six-day closure.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan was defeated in Parliament last week, fears have grown among some businesses of a no-deal exit.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Airbus, which makes aircraft wings in the UK, warned it could shift manufacturing from the UK in the event of no deal.\n\nJLR said its move had been under consideration for some time, but it was waiting for clarity over the terms of Britain's EU withdrawal.

wedding plans and strategy over the past few months, dropped the ball so spectacularly in the last four days?\n\nThis was going to be a different wedding - no massed ranks of dignitaries, no traditional wedding cake, members of the public invited to view the happy just-married couple, sustainable, seasonably and renewably sourced victuals.\n\nOver the last couple of months announcements have come and gone, by and large slavishly followed by broadcasters, newspapers and websites well aware of the interest of the audience.\n\nAnd now this.  \n\nRumour and conjecture  \n\nThe usual tactic of the palace is to say nothing about stories that come up that run counter to the royal narrative, and wait for them to go away.  \n\nGiven that there are so few reliable sources for real royal news, and that broadcasters are unhappy running stories on rumour and conjecture alone, it was by and large a winning strategy.\n\nBut with the entertainment website TMZ apparently having a hotline to the father of the bride, the palace's near-monopoly on information has been broken.  \n\nTMZ has functioned as a rival press office, issuing apparently well-sourced bulletins on Thomas Markle's health and state of mind that left the palace blindsided.\n\nThe response to 24 hours that entirely contradicted the previously stated plan for the wedding? No comment.  \n\nWho will walk the bride down the aisle? No comment.  \n\nWhat on Earth is going on? No comment.\n\nAmongst the many who are now ever-so-wise after the event, there are questions.  \n\nHow could the palace have let Mr Markle fall into a paparazzi trap? Why wasn't someone sent out to mind him?\n\nBut was someone really going to sit in a town outside Tijuana for six months, fighting off photographers?  \n\nAnd maybe a man who is clearly not wild on company didn't really fancy that?\n\nThe BBC understands but has been unable to confirm that Kensington Palace did offer assistance to Thomas Markle in the months running up to Saturday's wedding.\n\nThe presumption must be that he declined it.\n\nDrown out the discord\n\nThe palace media operations are not that big, sometimes (like many press offices) not that good, and they operate by and large on precedent.\n\nWe do it like this because we've always done it like this; this is public and we will comment, this is private and we will not comment.\n\nThat means they don't appear to think strategy as much as they might, and they don't seem to have had a contingency plan for what might happen with Ms Markle's family.\n\nThe families of previous brides understood the rules, even if as so-called commoners they knew that a single narrative of the wedding would preserve the event. \n\nAnd they knew that if they stepped out of line they would be out in the cold.\n\nBut Ms Markle's extended family - most of them with little left to lose as they haven't seen the bride for many a moon and will spend the wedding in TV studios rather than in St George's Chapel - are different.\n\nThey have descended en masse on Britain, all with stories to tell and bank balances to improve.  \n\nAnd the previous reliance on the palace for titbits - that cake recipe, those flowers, that photographer - has vanished like dew on a spring morning.\n\nAt some point - presumably soon, as the current situation (\"no comment\") is untenable at this late date - there will be resolution.  \n\nAn announcement will come as to who will do what on the day. \n\nAnd the hope of the palace - probably well-founded - will be that the long-planned mechanics of the occasion will drown out the discord of the past four days. \n\nBut for the moment there is that thing that nature abhors, a vacuum. And every well-laid plan of the palace is consumed by the soap-opera drama playing out well beyond its control.\nTL;DR: Meghan Markle's family has found itself on the world stage ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday. As more  doubt is cast on whether her father will attend  the ceremony, the Royal Family's closely-controlled media operation has at times seemed to be unravelling.\n\nArticle: The Essex newcomer has been forced to postpone her biggest headline gig to date at London's Scala (7 December). \n\nWriting to her followers on Twitter, J thanked fans for their support saying:\"I am very weak and in hospital resting.\"\n\nHer record company has asked fans to hold on to their tickets. \n\nA scheduled show set to take place at Brighton's Coalition on 11 December currently remains unaffected. \n\nThis week the 22-year-old singer was included on the BBC's Sound Of 2011 long-list, tipping next year's most exciting new musical talent.\nTL;DR: Singer Jessie J, who recently scored a top 30 hit with her debut track Do It Like A Dude, has been admitted to hospital with a \"severe virus\".\n\nArticle: One man was found in the water and the other was\"unconscious on metal fishing equipment\"near Victoria Wharf in Plymouth at 23:50 BST on Monday.\n\nOne remains in intensive care in hospital, while the other is\"awake and talking\", police said.\n\nA man, from Dumfries, has been arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol while on a boat.\n\nThe 49-year-old is being held under the Railway & Transport Safety Act 2003 and remains in police custody.\n\nThe Marine Accident Investigation Branch has launched an investigation.\nTL;DR: Two men believed to be part of a fishing crew have fallen 20ft (6m) from a harbour wall.\n\nArticle: The Australian navy ship HMAS Maitland and four merchant vessels were involved in rescue operations 75km (45 miles) south-west of Indonesia's Java Island. \n\nThe search followed a distress call on Wednesday from a vessel which said it had 150 people on board.\n\nIndonesian teams had searched the waters, but could not locate the boat.  \n\nThe country's search and rescue agency, Basarnas, sent two boats and a helicopter to the area on Wednesday but found nothing and returned to base. \n\nBut on Thursday a merchant vessel said it had found six people in the water, and more survivors were rescued during the day. \n\n\"Three survivors have serious injuries, but are in a stable condition. They are on board HMAS Maitland,\"the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said in a statement.\n\nIt added that merchant vessels APL Bahrain, Gwenolen, AR Carelia and Da Ging Xia were involved in the search.\n\n'Grave fears'\n\nCaptain Manuel Nistorescu from the APL Bahrain ship told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that a group of Afghan men he picked up had been in the water for 24 hours. \n\nThere were also women and children on the missing boat, he added.\n\n\"They had an engine break and the water was coming, and the pump for pumping out the water was not working and the boat sinks. This is what I understand from them,\"he said.\n\nThe number of missing people could not be confirmed, Australia's Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare told reporters.\n\n\"We have grave fears for a lot more,\"he said.''Don't underestimate how difficult this task is; don't underestimate how big the sea that we're searching is.''\n\nAsylum seekers often target Christmas Island, off Australia's northwest coast, to get to the country. They make the journey from Indonesia in boats that are usually overloaded and poorly maintained.\n\nIn June, a boat with 200 asylum seekers sank near the island - 17 bodies were found and another 70 were feared dead after a three-day search. That was the second boat to sink in a week, reigniting the debate on asylum in parliament.\n\nEarlier this month, lawmakers approved the re-opening of offshore processing camps for asylum seekers in Nauru and PNG.\n\nThe moves are aimed at deterring asylum seekers from making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat, amid an increasing number of arrivals. \n\nAustralia says it will also increase its intake of refugees to 20,000 a year, from the current 13,750, in line with recommendations by an expert panel.\nTL;DR: Australian and commercial ships plucked 55 people from the sea as a search continued after a boat carrying asylum seekers was believed to have sunk.\n\nArticle: Each club will donate \u00a350,000 to the Trussell Trust, with the funds going to its 19 food banks in Greater Manchester.\n\nThe clubs said the donations would\"compensate for the temporary loss of food donations on match days\".\n\n\"We are pleased to come together with our fans to help vulnerable members of society in a City United.\"\n\nThe Manchester United Supporters Trust said they were also\"overwhelmed\"after fans' groups at Everton and Liverpool also pledged \u00a33,000 towards the fund.\n\nIt follows a new co-operation between the Fans' Foodbanks fundraising groups of the Manchester clubs.\n\nThe groups usually collect supplies outside Old Trafford and the Etihad stadiums before games but this has been interrupted by the suspension of football due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a joint statement, Manchester City and Manchester United said:\"We are proud of the role our supporters play in helping local food banks and recognise the increased strain likely to be placed on these charities by the impact of coronavirus.\"\n\nMCFC Fans Foodbank Support said the donation would be\"an enormous help\", adding\"hunger doesn't wear club colours\".\n\nRachel Macklin from the Trussell Trust said:\"We're working closely with our network to understand each food bank's situation, offer guidance, and work out how we can best support them.\n\n\"We know we won't be able to do this alone, so we are truly grateful for the support Manchester United and Manchester City are showing local food banks.\"\nTL;DR: Manchester City and Manchester United have joined up to donate \u00a3100,000 for food banks in response to coronavirus.\n\nArticle: Meeting Theresa May for talks in Paris, Francois Hollande said he recognised the UK needed time to prepare but stressed:\"The sooner the better.\"\n\nHe said the UK's choice was to stay in the single market and accept freedom of movement or to\"have another status\".\n\nMrs May said she would deliver on demands for\"controls\"on movement.\n\nGreatest danger\n\nDuring a joint press conference with the UK's prime minister following talks at the Elysee Palace, he said he respected the UK's decision to leave the EU and said, in terms of a timescale for negotiating a new relationship:\"For France, the sooner the better.\"\n\n\"There cannot be discussions or pre-negotiations before the negotiations, but we can of course prepare these negotiations and we can understand that your government, that's just been formed, needs this time.\"\n\nHe said uncertainty was the greatest danger and also repeated France's argument that the UK could only get access to the single market if it accepted the free movement of people.\n\n\"It will be a choice facing the UK - remain in the single market and then assume the free movement that goes with it or to have another status.

A war where Vietnamese troops, sent as saviours but soon seen as invaders, paid a steep price in lives and limbs during a gruelling decade-long guerilla conflict. \n\nOn the 25th anniversary of their withdrawal from Cambodia, Vietnamese veterans are still haunted by their memories of war with Pol Pot's army. \n\nSome wonder why Cambodians are not more grateful to the troops who freed them from the brutal Khmer Rouge regime.\n\n\"Anyone who came back from Cambodia intact was a lucky person,\"said Nguyen Thanh Nhan, 50, a veteran of the war and author of the autobiographical book\"Away from Home Season - The Story of a Vietnamese Volunteer Veteran in Cambodia\".\n\nSent to Cambodia at the age of 20, Mr Nhan served from 1984 to 1987 in a frontline combat unit near the Thai-Cambodian border where some of the bloodiest confrontations with Khmer Rouge fighters took place. \n\nThough the Vietnamese government has never officially confirmed casualty numbers, some 30,000 Vietnamese troops were believed to have been killed before the final withdrawal in September 1989. \n\nBanned in its original form by the Vietnamese government, Mr Nhan's book recounts the hardships of the Vietnamese soldiers and their camaraderie while trying to survive among a population who played host to them by day, and their enemy by night. \n\nMuch like the young Americans who fought in Vietnam, Mr Nhan's years in Cambodia have left indelible psychological marks. He still suffers from nightmares, and their daytime equivalent that drag him back into the terror of battle. \n\n\"When your companions die in battle, it is a very great loss,\"Mr Nhan said.\"During the war, the battle does not stop. We have no time to reflect. We must be strong to continue. Later, more than 30 years later, memories come back - over and over again.\"\n\n\"The injury in the body is not so heavy but our injury was mental. Many soldiers, one or two years later, when they came back, they went mad.\"\n\nHis experience parallels the disillusionment of American troops, a generation before who arrived in Vietnam believing they were coming to save a nation, only to find that many ordinary people considered them the enemy. \n\n\"American soldiers thought they helped Vietnam. Then their illusion was broken,\"Mr Nhan said.\"We were the same in Cambodia.\"\n\nVietnam launched an invasion of Cambodia in late December 1978 to remove Pol Pot. Two million Cambodians had died at the hands of his Khmer Rouge regime and Pol Pot's troops had conducted bloody cross-border raids into Vietnam, Cambodia's historic enemy, massacring civilians and torching villages.\n\nPol Pot fled ahead of the onslaught and Phnom Penh was placed under Vietnamese control in a little over a week. \n\nThose that survived the Khmer Rouge regime initially greeted the Vietnamese as liberators. Years later, however, Vietnamese troops were still in Cambodia and by then, many Cambodians considered them occupiers.\n\nCambodia was an unpopular war for Vietnam, said Carlyle Thayer, an expert on Vietnam and emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.\n\n\"The Vietnamese military had been trained and experienced in overthrowing an occupying power and all of a sudden, the shoe was on the other foot. They had to invade Cambodia and occupy it, and succeed in setting up a government and engineer a withdrawal.\"\n\nUnlike Vietnam's wars against the French and Americans, the intervention in Cambodia was\"downplayed\"to the Vietnamese public, Mr Thayer said. When soldiers returned from Cambodia without the fanfare of previous wars, veterans felt that they had been\"forgotten\". \n\nGratitude was also not forthcoming from Cambodia, where hostility towards the Vietnamese remains ubiquitous. It is an enmity born of conflicts between ancient emperors and kings, of lost territory and a much smaller Cambodia faring poorly through history to a far more populous Vietnam. \n\nToday, many in Cambodia would like to forget that it was Vietnam that saved their country from Pol Pot's vicious revolution.\n\nEvery few months, a group of veterans from the war in Cambodia meet in Ho Chi Minh City. On a recent Sunday morning, their get-together started early with short welcome speeches followed by swift toasts of strong rice wine. \n\nAsked about the war, their mood shifted perceptibly. What happened in Cambodia is not something they discuss often. \n\nOne relents, likely out of politeness, and he describes an enduring image from his first days in Cambodia in 1979. \n\nLe Thanh Hieu's unit pursued the retreating Khmer Rouge to the border with Thailand. He remembers seeing Cambodian villagers lying on the sides of roads dying of starvation and illness. \n\n\"They were dying everywhere. They were dying of hunger,\"said the 54-year-old.\"We didn't have rice to feed the starving. We only had army rations to feed ourselves in battle.\"\n\nYet, he said,\"faced with this situation the soldiers could not avoid saving lives\"and they used their rations to make a thin rice soup for the starving.\n\n\"I don't want to have this experience to tell you about,\"Mr Hieu said.\n\nVietnam does not want to entirely forget about the war in Cambodia, said Mr Nhan. It only wants to remember an official version: a victorious, lightning attack that toppled Pol Pot. \n\nBest forgotten, Mr Nhan said, are the 10 years of punishing hit-and-run fighting and the largely-forgotten veterans still scarred from their experiences.\n\n\"For me, the truth needs to be said,\"he said. \n\n\"Sometimes I think the dead are lucky. They rest in peace. We have to struggle every day. Our lives continue.\"\nTL;DR: On 30 April 1975, the last American helicopters beat an ignominious retreat from Saigon as the tanks of the North Vietnamese Army rumbled into the capital of defeated South Vietnam.\n\nArticle: The Chief Justice resuming his duties at the Supreme Court Complex on Thursday said that judiciary is the backbone of a civilised\n                  society, and that it has no place for autocratic and arbitrary behaviour.\n               \n\nFair judgements\n\n\nQuoting a verse from Dhammapada - Buddhist Scriptures, the Chief Justice said that jurisdiction and justice must be determined\n                  in a way that is acceptable to all the parties.\n               \n\n\"He is not just, who arbitrates hastily.

So when the economy is growing, so is demand for goods and services and thus their prices. \n\nIt's not just GDP, but employment is also expanding. The UK has a record high number of people in work, while US unemployment is falling and expected to recover to the pre-recession rate of 5%, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere was one other period that required a new term to describe an unusual time. \n\nIn the 1970s, stagflation referred to high inflation while output was falling - precisely the opposite of what is happening today, but similarly goes against normal economic relationships. \n\nThe reason then, as now, is oil price shocks.\n\nIn the 1970s, two wars in the Middle East caused oil prices to shoot up and raise prices, which remained elevated despite slowing economic activity. \n\nSince the shocks were external, and there was little capacity for economies like the US to respond domestically, the result was the unusual combination of sustained high inflation during a recession.\n\nIn the past few years, the UK also saw high inflation despite the worst recession in decades. You may recall that the Bank of England routinely described it as imported price pressure. The governor said that high energy and commodity prices were raising costs and there was zero domestically-generated inflation.\n\nBreathing space\n\nNow we have the opposite - there are price movements, but these stem from cheaper imported energy. Oil prices have plummeted since last summer. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says the UK's record low 0% CPI has been driven by energy prices (motor fuels) falling 16.6% in the past year to February. It's also down to food prices, another sizeable imported commodity, which fell by 3.4%. \n\nThis means, though, that when volatile elements like energy and food are stripped out of CPI, core inflation is still positive at 1.2%. So, prices are rising and the economy isn't truly deflationary. \n\nStill, factory gate prices, or the prices of goods sold by UK manufacturers, are seeing deflation, falling by 1.8% from a year earlier. That eventually feeds through to what we pay in stores. But, so many goods are imported, the more important price indicators are most likely to come from abroad. For instance, China is experiencing low price pressures that will be exported.\n\nA little breathing space in terms of the costs of energy, food, and consumer goods is welcome after years of high inflation and below-trend growth. \n\nThe big question is how worried we should be about deflation. The Bank of England says that any deflation will be temporary. In other words, it's unlikely to be 15 years of falling prices as in Japan.  \n\nIn any case, for now, falling prices while the economy is growing well may warrant a new term.

There are 41,000 Syrian refugees living in two neighbouring camps here. The situations they've fled from are often desperate but that doesn't stop people falling in love. And when that happens, they do what people everywhere do, they get married. \n\nRozhin's salon isn't the only one in the camp, but it may be the most stylish. Small details, such as a coral sink placed next to a coral chair and proper reclining seats, let you know that Rozhin is not new to the business. She herself is immaculate, with no make-up.\"I do make-up all day, it's like work for me,\"she says. Her five daughters aged from one to seven often wear matching outfits.\n\n\"I like to look glamorous, I'm always like this,\"she says.\n\nRozhin and her family fled Qamishli, a Kurdish town in Syria in 2012, as the civil war picked up pace.\n\n\"In Syria I had a normal life, a normal job as a beautician, and then when we came here it was too hard, too tough to adjust to the environment,\"she says.\n\nShe cried a lot, she says, because her daughter fell ill and she was homesick.\n\n\"I kept begging my husband to go back, even though it was dangerous, but he refused. In time, I adapted to the situation and my daughter got better.\"\n\nIt helped that she was able to open her business. The shop was initially a grocery run by her husband, but after it failed to make enough money, Rozhin saw her opportunity. She borrowed some money from her uncle and turned it into a salon.\n\nAfter spotting the demand for wedding gowns and party dresses, she started stocking those too. Now the shop has been going for five years. It's named Tulin, after her daughter.\n\nAside from regulars coming in wanting a haircut, an eyebrow shape or a catch-up, Rozhin does up to 30 weddings a year. Many of her customers are Kurdish, and it cannot be overstated how lavish these weddings are.\n\nThe two suitable halls in the camp host 300-400 guests, which is - everyone in the room jumps in to explain - extremely small by Kurdish standards. One thousand guests would be more typical, they say. At Kurdish weddings, even the guests are made up exquisitely with flicked eyeliner, I'm told, thickly applied pale foundation, bum-length hair extensions or hijabs patterned with designer logos. \n\nBecause of the heat and sheer quantity of make-up needed, usually Rozhin does the bride's hair first and the make-up is done last to reduce the risk of it melting on the bride's face. Weddings usually take place at 7pm or 8pm when the air has cooled, but in the summer the temperature will still be in the 30s - which you have to factor in when the wedding make-up is as thick as face paint. \n\nEach bride takes around two-and-a-half hours to get ready, but it's not just the brides. The whole wedding party may want their hair and makeup done, and sometimes Rozhin has two weddings to do in one day. \n\nFortunately she has friends on hand to help. The International Medical Corps runs a programme training survivors of gender-based violence to do hair and make-up, so she brings them in to lend a hand.\"There's a lot of work to do with the bridal party,\"says Rozhin.\"When I call them to come and help they're so happy - we are all sisters and we have confidence in each other. After the job is done we drink tea and coffee together.\"\n\nThe majority of Rozhin's brides are very young.\n\n\"Usually I don't ask how old they are, but from their faces they are 18 or 19 on average. \n\n\"I don't know why they get married in every case, but when you're 18 years old and you're living here with your family - what else is there to do?\"\n\nIt also means having a big party. This is important for people coming to terms with a difficult past, and everyday refugee camp life - which means 20 people to one latrine, makeshift housing and constant vigilance against disease.\n\n\"For every single woman this is one special day to have a big glamorous dress and make-up,\"says Rozhin.\"Just one day to feel special. No-one will be hurt by this.\"\n\nWhile some brides might relish the experience of being made to feel glamorous, a mural showing a bride holding a teddy bear is painted outside the shop. It's a sobering reminder of the problem of young girls being married off to much older men - something which is particularly rampant in refugee camps.\n\nBut the shop is a place for escapism, even if the women can't forget their problems altogether.\n\n\"In the salon we try out new techniques with make-up, but we are always thinking about our friends and relatives.\"\n\nThinking about them, and often worrying about them.\n\nRozhin is the main breadwinner of the family. Her husband, Ahmed, finds work some days, but the next day there be no work to be had, and he stays at home. \n\n\"I am the one who brings money to the family and my husband does not have any problem with this. Usually the men here don't like that, for a woman to be in charge. But he says,'If we're getting money that's OK.'\"\n\nBusiness has been up and down. Having her twin girls recently meant she had to close up for a few months, allowing her rivals in the camp to pick up some of her regular customers, but now things are getting better.\n\n\"There are another three that have a lot of customers,\"Rozhin says.\n\nMany of the families in the camp have been living here for at least as long as Rozhin has. Communities build up, neighbours get to know each other, people fall in love. Getting married means having a stake in the future, even when that future is uncertain. If you look carefully at the wedding dresses in Rozhin's shop, you can see the hems are lightly stained the same colour as the gravelly paths of the camp.\n\nHow many women have worn these dresses, and made the same journey to the same hall, careful not to mess up their hair and make-up, and wondering what comes next?\n\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.\nTL;DR: Even in refugee camps life must go on, and when a man and a woman decide to marry the rare chance for a big celebration may be seized with both hands. In one camp in northern Iraq, beautician Rozhin Ahmed-Hussein - herself a Syrian Kurdish refugee - finds that she is rarely short of work.\n\nArticle: The funds will go to the British Red Cross and Red International, which are working to deliver food and medicine to civilians in Syria.\n\nThousands of people have died during months of unrest since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nA government spokesman said:\"Almost 4,500 people will benefit from this.\"\n\nHe added:\"The money donated by the committee will help the charities provide an ambulance service and provision of life-saving first aid, clinics to provide healthcare for people with chronic conditions, distribution of hygiene kits, and of food, blankets, mattresses and cooking kits.\"\n\nThe committee has also allocated about \u00a340,000 to Oxfam to help 85,000 in a refugee camp in Sudan.\n\nThe charity has appealed for help to provide clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene equipment.\nTL;DR: The Isle of Man government's overseas aid committee has donated about \u00a325,000 to help international charities working in the Middle East.\n\nArticle: Welsh Office Minister David Jones admits cuts of 5.1% in 2011/12 and 6.7% in 2012/13 are\"challenging\"but believes frontline policing can be protected.\n\nSouth Wales Police Federation said officers were fearing for jobs.\n\nEx-Home Office minister Alun Michael said it was\"extremely worrying\".\n\nEvery force in England and Wales has had the same percentage reduction in funding, the Home Office said.\n\nMr Jones said it was\"clear that Welsh forces can make the necessary savings while protecting the front line and prioritising the visibility and availability of policing.\n\n\"By cutting out costs and scrapping bureaucracy we are saving hundreds of millions of pounds and hundreds of thousands of man hours across the UK, enabling our police officers to be out on the streets chasing criminals instead of spending their time in the office chasing targets.\"\n\nHe said all Welsh forces were embarking on a period of major change, but would continue to protect the public.\n\nMr Michael said the situation was\"extremely worrying\"and he thought the plan to take rural funding away from forces like Dyfed-Powys was a\"ridiculous\"idea.\n\nThe Cardiff South and Penarth MP told BBC Wales:\"The police are not going to disappear from our streets - they will do their best but it's going to be extremely challenging.\n\n\"We need police to be there to nip things in the bud when we get these low level offences and that's been done in the Welsh police forces quite well and that's why we have seen crime levels come down.\n\n\"If you get to a more reactive situation it will be turning the clock back and that's why I think that the government are wrong in front-ending. \n\n\"These cuts are going to go very deep, very early and it's going to be very challenging for the police.\"\n\nAssembly government funding for the four Welsh police authorities for 2011-12 will be \u00a3161m - a 3.46% cut in cash terms in the next financial year.\n\nSocial Justice Minister Carl Sargeant said the Welsh police authorities had a very good record of collaboration, and that would grow in importance in future years but warned of\"hard choices\".\n\nDelyth Humfryes, chair of Dyfed Powys Police Authority, said it faced cash reductions of \u00a37.012m, or 11.5%, over the next two years. \n\n\"Cuts of this magnitude will inevitably alter the way in which policing services are delivered in future,\"she said.\n\nShe added the cuts, which she said did not acknowledge the additional pressures involved in policing a large rural area, were likely to result in 250 to 350 job losses.\n\nShe said:\"The future will be very different to what it is now and we will really have to prioritise in future when life is at risk and not follow up every crime that has been committed.\n\n\"The small crimes that just get an insurance number in other forces - we've never done that but in future the chief constable will have to look at new ways of saving money.\"\n\nGary Bowen, chair of the South Wales Police Federation said officers were fearing for their jobs.\n\nHe said:\"Our concerns are that this figure of 20% over four years is being introduced by people who have no idea. \n\n\"I struggle to see how they will achieve these cuts by merely saying they are going to reduce bureaucracy and backroom staff.\n\n\"When you think 80% of the police budget is spent on people, if we got rid of everything the service is paying for staff, clearly we will cover the cut but quite clearly that isn't going to be the result and they are going to cut people as well.\"\n\nRussell Roberts, chair of South Wales Police Authority, said it was working hard to see how cuts could be planned to minimise their impact.  \n\n\"This is undoubtedly going to be a difficult process, and painful decisions are going to have to be made,\"said Mr Roberts.\n\n'Massive impact'\n\nHe added:\"The home secretary has previously said that she wants police officers to continue to cut crime and catch criminals, within drastically reduced budgets. This is a huge challenge, but also represents a fairly naive view of what modern day policing entails.  \n\n\"So much policing work is hidden from public view, and is simply not limited to the visible aspect of officers walking on the beat or driving police cars.  \n\n\"To stop the less obvious policing work could have a massive impact on south Wales, and this is something we will find hard to accept.\n\nPlaid Cymru's Elfyn Llwyd, a member of the House of Commons Justice Committee, described the cuts as\"irresponsible\".\n\n\"Just how exactly the UK government expects to see a fall in crime rates at the same time as slashing the policing budget is beyond me,\"said the Meirionnydd Nant Conwy MP. \n\nWrexham MP Ian Lucas said:\"North Wales Police Authority have already warned they expect job losses to follow and the chief constable told North Wales politicians at a recent briefing that he expected 200 police officers could be lost\".\nTL;DR: Dyfed-Powys Police warns it is likely to cut up to 350 jobs, as the four Welsh police forces have been given details of savings they need to make.\n\nArticle: No UK vessels will fish for scallops in the Bay of Seine during the period when the French are not allowed to catch.\n\nA joint statement from the two governments said talks in London on Wednesday had been\"constructive\".\n\nBut a finalised deal hinges on a\"reasonable compensation package\"for smaller British boats, which lose out. \n\nAround 40 French boats clashed with five UK crafts off the coast of northern France last week.\n\nTalks were held between representatives of the UK and French fishing industries and Defra officials on Wednesday in an attempt to resolve tensions. \n\nRegulations allow British boats to fish in the Bay of Seine, a scallop-rich area off the Normandy coast, all year round. \n\nBut French fishermen are banned from taking scallops from the area between May 15 and October 1 to conserve stocks.\n\nA previous industry agreement prevented UK vessels larger than 15 metres from fishing for scallops in the area during that period too, but smaller boats were free to do so.\n\nThe deal agreed in principle on Wednesday would prevent smaller boats from taking advantage of this window.\n\nThose vessels will be compensated for their losses, with the amount to be agreed at a meeting in Paris on Friday. \n\nBut a UK industry representative involved in the talks said the deal would only be finalised if British fishermen did not lose out.\n\nJim Portus, chief executive of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, said:\"I'm very pleased that we've negotiated a deal which satisfies the honour of fishermen on both sides.\n\n\"The French are in a hurry to make sure that it happens because what they don't want either is another conflict.\n\n\"Quite frankly, if it's not good enough on Friday, it will be rejected.\"\n\nHe added he was\"pleased\"the French had expressed\"regret\"during the talks for the recent clashes. \n\nAll British boats have been asked to voluntarily stop fishing for scallops in the conflict area until a deal is finalised. \n\nSpeaking after the talks, French industry representative Pascal Coquet said it was a\"good deal\".\n\nThe talks were held after French and British boats clashed off the coast of northern France last week, with UK crews reporting rocks, smoke bombs and other projectiles were hurled at them during the confrontation.\n\nWhat exactly happened?\n\nThe French boats gathered overnight on Monday last week in protest against so-called\"pillaging\"by five larger British vessels.\n\nThe British were chased away and two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows.\n\nThe British crews say they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them.

More than 75% of its exports head south of the border, while 18% of US exports are sent north. \n\nBut Mr Trudeau and his ministers have repeatedly hammered home other statistics over the past few weeks that underscore the importance of Canada to American commerce.\n\nNearly nine million US jobs depend on trade and investment from Canada, while Canada is the top customer for 35 US states. \n\nMr Trump also made it clear he views economic relations with Mexico in a very different light than those with Canada. Mexico is the third partner with Canada and the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n\n\"It's a much less severe situation than what's taking place on the southern border,\"the president said in reference to Canada-US trade during the joint news conference with Mr Trudeau at the White House. \n\nThis first face-to-face meeting also offered a clue at how far Mr Trudeau was willing to go preserve those vital trade ties. \n\nHe refused to bite when the press repeatedly baited him to criticise his host on thorny issues like immigration, though many of his own policies stand as a reproach to those of the new US president's. \n\nMr Trudeau is a self-described feminist who calls himself\"extremely free trade\"and has made Canada's openness to immigration, diversity, and refugees part of the country's - and his own - brand.  \n\nBut on Monday his message was that\"the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they chose to govern themselves\". \n\nIn fact, Mr Trudeau and Liberal MPs have been disciplined in their refusal to criticise Mr Trump over the past few months. \n\nThe most pointed they got was when the prime minister tweeted out a welcome to refugees just as the US was implementing the temporary ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n\nOpposition Conservative leader Rona Ambrose said that discipline is a smart move given how paramount relations with the US are to Canada. \n\n\"This is a delicate situation here. I don't think it would help anyone in this country if the prime minister went to the US and started a fight,\"she told reporters in Ottawa. \n\nAnother clue as to just how much significance Ottawa has placed on this first face-to-face meeting with the new American administration was the prime minister's entourage. \n\nMr Trudeau brought five ministers with him to Washington, a who's who of Canada's top Cabinet members, as well as his most trusted senior aides. \n\nThe two world leaders worked hard to play up the similarities in their first meeting and beyond that key trade assurance, the Canadian delegation will leave Washington having secured a few other commitments from the US.\n\nThose include commitments to collaborate on improving clean energy and enhancing efficiency at border crossings, to tackle opioid trafficking, and the creation of a Canada-US council geared towards promoting women-owned enterprises.\nTL;DR: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had a fine line to walk on Monday and came through with his best diplomatic balancing act.\n\nArticle: Those from poorer backgrounds are 67% more likely to score below average in vocabulary at five than their peers, the Ready to Read Wales report said. \n\nThe Read On.

Her most valuable pieces are among the most expensive to be found on eBay - a 1977 Silver Hi-Jumper Stunt Cycle, worth around \u00a31,000, and her 1973 first edition Stunt Cycle. \n\nThe Stunt Cycle underwent some cosmetic changes during its production, mainly to reduce manufacturing costs - the first edition having chrome features and painted highlights. \n\nNow it's intensely collectable. \n\n\"Used values on the collectors' market have risen annually, the advent of the sites like eBay being godsends for them,\"says Robins.\"Collecting is addictive, and once you start, you find yourself seeking out the obscure and also then having to have every derivative.\"\n\nRobins uses her Facebook page to alert fans to items appearing on eBay, emphasising\"factory sealed\"or especially rare credentials where appropriate. She gives price advice and instructions on repairing damaged products. \n\nIn the UK, the toys were made at Ideal's Wokingham factory from 1974-1981 and there were several factors that ensured a toy representation of an American motorcycle stuntman would become implanted in British popular culture. \n\nThe jump happened in a simpler era. The posters for the Wembley event proclaimed in large letters that it was on Whit Monday. The 80,000 in attendance - the largest for any Evel Knievel jump - got something more exciting than morris dancing and a Whitsun parade. \n\nThey got America itself. Knievel's star-spangled leathers and Harley Davidson were a thrilling manifestation of a country usually experienced only through films and television.  \n\nTransatlantic flight was still expensive, and Britain had - literally - been in the darkness of the Three-Day Week.\n\nBritons of all ages were dazzled by this daredevil's derring-do. In a time when children played out on bicycles - without parental observation - youngsters pulling wheelies recklessly with unalloyed joy saw themselves in their idol's image. The Raleigh Chopper was already popular and the Raleigh Grifter was launched 12 months after Wembley.  \n\nThe fact that the stuntman crashed on landing would only enhance the event's legacy. He rode and jumped on instinct - his motorcycles did not have speedometers - and fans discuss to this day whether the wrong sprocket prevented him gaining the necessary speed on take-off. \n\nIn the minutes before the jump he took several run-ups - all upping the drama - and changed the motorcycle he would use.\n\nClipping the safety board above the final bus, he came agonisingly close to remaining in control of his bike before sliding down the landing ramp and across the Wembley turf, exacerbating an existing pelvis injury and suffering a vertebral compression fracture, concussion and a broken hand. He got to his feet to tell his fans he would never jump again (he jumped several more times) before heading off to hospital.  \n\nEvel Knievel superfan Bryan Richards had a particularly powerful epiphany on his seventh birthday, in 1974, when he realised he shared his big day with Evel. \n\nLike Robins, he runs a Facebook page - his is devoted primarily to the 1975 Wembley jump.\"I believe the true fan number to be around a dozen or so who actively pursue their hobby with around a couple of hundred who are just'likers' with fond memories.\"\n\nTo date he has spent at least \u00a320,000 on Knievel memorabilia. His girlfriend has entered him for Mastermind with the star as his specialist subject. And he has arranged a coach party for 26 May to visit sites connected with Evel's time in London. \n\nThe highlight will undoubtedly be access to the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Richards is hoping to take the helmet Knievel wore for the jump along with some leathers and possibly a motorcycle. \n\nOther stops include hotels where Knievel stayed and staged a pre-jump press conference, a Clapham riverside photo location and the Royal London Hospital where Knievel was taken after crashing.\n\nKnievel died in 2007, and while Richards never met his idol, three years ago he stayed with his children Kelly and Alicia and met the wider Knievel clan in the hometown, Butte, Montana. \n\nRichard Hammond, another Knievel fan, was more fortunate, interviewing him for an hour-long documentary, filmed four months before Knievel's death.\n\nFans born decades after the Wembley jump can look like their hero in fancy dress outfits.\n\nAs well as producing his own products, such as iPhone and iPad covers, some marking the anniversary, Richards attempts to act as an ambassador to the next generation of young Knievel fans. \n\nOlder enthusiasts can look forward to more looking back via another documentary, Being Knievel, coming to London in October.

When Mr Aamer was arrested in 2001, he had three children and his wife was pregnant. \n\nUS authorities said he led a unit of Taliban fighters against Nato troops and had met Osama Bin Laden. But Mr Aamer has always said he was in Afghanistan with his family to undertake charity work.\n\nHis cause has some support among the British public, with more than 100,000 people signing a petition calling for his release.\n\nAt least 14 British nationals and residents were held at the Guantanamo Bay at one time, with Binyam Mohamed's release in 2009 leaving only Mr Aamer there. \n\nIn answers given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Victoria Derbyshire show last month Mr Aamer said he was\"falling apart like an old car\"having joined a hunger strike by other inmates\"for justice\", \n\nMr Aamer said it was difficult for him to say if the UK government has been doing enough on his behalf, but it was his lawyer's opinion that the foreign secretary\"was sincere in his efforts to secure my release\". \n\nHe added he believed he will be released\"very soon\".\nTL;DR: The case of the last UK resident held in Guantanamo Bay has been raised by Prime Minister David Cameron in talks with US President Barack Obama.\n\nArticle: Glasgow Sheriff Court was told that 58-year-old Harry Clarke passed out at the wheel of a bus on 7 April 2010.\n\nIt has now heard a DVLA assessment form from 2011 noted he had no history of blackouts within the past five years. \n\nOne of Mr Clarke's managers agreed that if he did pass out in 2010 then the DVLA statement was a lie.\n\nThe court previously heard that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the wheel as the Glasgow City Council bin lorry went out of control on Queen Street on 22 December 2014, killing six pedestrians and injuring 15 others.\n\nMedical assessment\n\nThe fatal accident inquiry (FAI) has also heard from First Bus inspector John Stewart who told the court that Mr Clarke, in his previous employment as a bus driver, had blacked out while unwell at a bus stop in 2010.\n\nOn Wednesday, the sixth day of the FAI, which is being overseen by Sheriff John Beckett QC, the court heard evidence from Douglas Gellan, an area manager with Glasgow City Council's land and environmental services department.\n\nHe was questioned by Dorothy Bain QC, who is acting for the bereaved Morton family.\n\nMr Gellan agreed that a medical assessment was important in the recruitment of a bin lorry driver as anyone unfit would be a risk to the public.\n\nThe witness confirmed that medical assessment was outsourced to private firms and he agreed with Ms Bain that an employee found to have lied in medical questionnaires would face\"serious disciplinary consequences\".\n\nThe inquiry was shown a Bupa medical questionnaire filled in by Mr Clarke in December 2010, in which he claimed to have been off work for seven days of sickness in the previous two years. \n\nThe hearing was then shown an attendance record from his employment with First Bus when he was a driver in 2010, that detailed a three-and-a-half week period of sickness in April that year. It also showed a one-week period of sickness in March of the same year. \n\nDuring the inquiry it was heard that before working as a bin lorry driver with Glasgow City Council, Mr Clarke was taken on as a driver taking special needs children to school and then a gritter. \n\nSickness declaration\n\nThe inquiry was also shown a HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) sick pay declaration from Mr Clarke where it says he had last worked on 7 April 2010 and the reason for his sickness was\"Vasovagal\", which Ms Bain explained meant\"faint\". \n\nMr Gellan said he would have wanted to know about this.\n\nHe also said that if forms had been misleadingly filled in, the council would investigate but it would rely on individuals to tell the truth in the first place.\n\nThe inquiry heard that Mr Clarke had to renew his HGV licence every five years after turning 45.\n\nHe had a DVLA (the government's Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency) assessment with a Doctor Willox on 6 December 2011.\n\nMs Bain produced the assessment form from that day which claimed Mr Clarke had no history of blackouts within the past five years.\n\nThe QC noted that as it stands, it is a\"hypothetical assertion\"that Mr Clarke had in fact\"blacked out\"in 2010. This was based on the report of bus inspector Mr Stewart.\n\nMs Bain asked Mr Gellan that if we accepted that Mr Clarke had blacked out in 2010, was his statement on the DVLA form a lie? \n\nMr Gellan agreed that it was a lie.\n\n'Unfit for duty'\n\nMs Bain said police had later asked Dr Willox what she would have said if she had been told about the alleged 2010 blackout. \n\nThe QC said Dr Willox told police she would have disclosed the alleged 2010 incident to the DVLA and the council, asked for Mr Clarke's medical records and declared him\"temporarily unfit for duty\".\n\nMs Bain then asked Mr Gellan if he knew if Mr Clarke had been investigated in 1994 for becoming dizzy behind the wheel of an HGV. The witness replied:\"No.\"\n\nShe then asked him if he knew anything about another incident concerning Mr Clarke in 2003. The witness said he did not.\n\nThe court was then shown a letter to a doctor at People Asset Management - a firm contracted by Glasgow City Council to carry out medical assessments. \n\nThe letter notes that Mr Clarke underwent\"extensive investigation\"at hospital, including brain scans, after the bin lorry crash.\n\nIt states that the most likely diagnosis for Mr Clarke was neurocardiogenic syncope (also known as vasovagal syncope) and notes there was\"no specific treatment\".  \n\nThe court heard that the letter noted Mr Clarke had\"accepted that he would not return to work as a lorry driver\".\n\n'Still here today'\n\nMs Bain asked Mr Gellan if this condition had been diagnosed in 2010, would the council have employed Mr Clarke as a driver? The witness replied:\"No.\"\n\nThe QC then asked the witness if the people killed in the bin lorry crash\"would still be here today\"if that had been the case? Mr Gellan replied:\"Yes.\"\n\nMs Bain concluded her cross-examination by stating:\"If he'd (Mr Clarke) told the truth, in forms in 2010 and 2011, we wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nThe inquiry is examining the lorry, its route and driver Harry Clarke's health.\n\nErin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the incident in the city's Queen Street and George Square.\n\nStephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.\n\nA further 15 people were injured.\n\nThe Crown Office has already concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution over the crash, with senior lawyers deeming it a\"tragic accident\".\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nScottish Courts\nTL;DR: The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash which killed six people has heard the driver \"lied\" on a DVLA form over a previous blackout.\n\nArticle: Participants say there is a growing sense of realism about the scale of what can be achieved in any new deal.\n\nBut there are concerns that the process could become bogged down in procedural wrangling after Russia asked for a review of voting procedures. \n\nThe meeting comes amid new warnings about global levels of warming gases. \n\nThis will be the 19th annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \n\nAt the meeting in South Africa in 2011, delegates adopted what's termed the Durban Platform which stated that a new international agreement should be negotiated by 2015 and come into force by 2020.\n\nPragmatic approach\n\nNow in Poland, negotiators are coming to terms with the emerging shape of that deal.\n\n\"There is a fair degree of convergence emerging about the character of a new agreement,\"said Elliot Diringer from the Centre for Energy and Climate Solutions, a long-time observer of the negotiations.  \n\n\"This reflects a greater sense of realism among the parties about what can accomplished in this process.\"\n\nThe delegates have been scarred by the experience in Copenhagen in 2009, when ambitions for a comprehensive deal foundered, despite the intense efforts of President Obama, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and others.\n\nWhat's emerging now is a looser agreement whereby countries set their own targets, but are subject to some form of review by other nations. \n\n\"The sort of model that's emerging for Paris, this acceptance of the notion that commitments will be self defined, it's a recognition that where the rubber really meets the road is at the domestic level, and the agreement needs to reflect that,\"said Elliot Diringer.\n\nThe meeting comes after a series of studies indicating the scale of the climate challenge. The fifth assessment report from the IPCC published in September suggested that without concerted political action the accepted 2C threshold to dangerous climate change would be passed sometime in the middle of this century.\n\nJust this week the World Meteorological Organization reported that concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were higher than ever. While the UN Environment Programme detailed the yawning gap between what nations have pledged to do and where the world needs to be in 2020 to avoid the worst impacts.\n\nAccording to the UNFCCC executive secretary Christiana Figueres, Warsaw is a pivotal moment to advance momentum towards a deal.\n\n\"We still have time and the means to limit warming to 2 degrees C. And the international process must push forward now to build the foundation for an ambitious universal climate agreement in 2015,\"she said.\n\nBut there are a number of difficulties on the road to Paris where the 2015 meeting will be held.\n\nRussia has emerged as a potential problem for the process as they have tabled an amendment on decision-making at the COP. \n\nThe process works on the basis of consensus but the Russians believe their objections were overruled at the meeting in Doha last year.\n\n\"Decision-making in the UNFCCC process has suffered evident setbacks over the past few years,\"the Russian delegation wrote in a statement.\n\nIt goes on to state that the voting system within the meeting needs to be addressed to rebuild confidence.\n\nClimate cliff hanger\n\nThe Russian concerns led to stalemate at a sub-meeting in June. There are worries that this might continue to hamper progress in Warsaw, where delegates will be keener than ever to avoid a breakdown. \n\n\"This has been haunting the process even before the Russians brought it up,\"said Norine Kennedy, who will be representing US business at the meeting. \n\n\"We've had a succession of COP cliff hangers and one or two countries always get rolled over in the effort to find consensus and last year that was Russia.\n\n\"The consensus question will have to be faced sooner or later and it's better they do this now than in Paris,\"she said.\n\nAnother key question is the shifting nature of development. Where once the UNFCCC was neatly divided into developing and developed nations, with the richer ones making all the cuts in emissions, there is now a greater push for every country to bear some of the load.\n\nBut not everyone is keen on this. \n\n\"I saw some comments from the Chinese side, saying they are going to insist on a common but differentiated responsibilities point, said Norine Kennedy.\n\n\"That will be a hard fought fight and it will lurk behind most of the interventions we will hear over the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Negotiators from around 190 countries are meeting in Warsaw to try to advance steps towards a global climate agreement.\n\nArticle: By Anthony ZurcherEditor, Echo Chambers\n\nWith a midterm congressional election looming in the fall and Republicans firmly in control of the House of Representatives and having the ability to block or delay legislation in the Senate, the outlook for any sweeping new proposals is gloomy. \n\n\"Gone is the audacity of hope,\"writes the BBC's Katy Kay.\"This State of the Union address didn't promise big changes on anything - there was no transformation on offer here. This was Mr Obama in realist mode with a workmanlike State of the Union address.\"\n\nWithout major new programmes on offer, discussion among commentators turned to the lack of major programmes.\n\n\"The address was an implicit acknowledgment that his once-grand legislative ambitions are over,\"writes Dana Milbank of the Washington Post.\"This approach is, by definition, limited in scope (it doesn't change laws) and temporary (the next president can undo Obama's executive orders with a stroke of the pen, just as Obama undid many of George W. Bush's orders).\"\n\nNational Journal's Ron Fournier asks:\"Is that all there is?\"\n\nHe continues:\"It was a good speech about a modest agenda delivered by a diminished leader, a man who famously promised to reject the politics of'small things' and aim big - to change the culture of Washington, to restore the public's faith in government, and to tackle enduring national problems with bold solutions.\"\n\nWashington Monthly's Ed Kilgore called the speech\"a minimalist version of one of those second-term Clinton [addresses] that covered a lot of ground and conveyed the sense that the president was snapping his fingers impatiently at the louts sitting down there on the other side of the aisle.\"\n\nKilgore's line reveals the quandary facing Mr Obama's supporters. What do you do when partisan opposition prevents any hope of legislative achievement? Blame conservatives in Congress, for one. \n\n\"For some time now, the Republican House has made it clear that they have no intention of governing,\"writes New York Times columnist Timothy Egan.\"They shut down the government for 16 days, in case you didn't get the point. And on Tuesday, they seemed more interested in having their pictures taken with the Duck Dynasty guy than finding middle ground with the American majority.\"\n\nAlthough pointing fingers at Congress may be comforting, Mr Obama and his supporters have been doing that ever since Republicans swept to power in the House in 2010. Talking Points Memo's Joshua Marshall writes approvingly that it seems Mr Obama has decided to stop trying to look toward Republicans for co-operation.\n\n\"Gone from the speech was what I'd heard in pretty much every other Obama State of the Union, pressing bipartisan cooperation, finding common ground, pushing points of agreement,\"he writes.\"There wasn't a contrary note. It was more just ignoring the whole thing, as though the President were saying,'Okay, guys, I get it. You won't do anything. Okay. Fine.'\"\n\nThat's not enough for Politico's Roger Simon, who writes:\"President Barack Obama couldn't give a bad speech if he tried, but he did his best Tuesday night.\"\n\nSimon contends that Mr Obama's speech was too soft, when harsh words and a\"fighting spirit\"were required.\n\n\"Obama needed to tell us how he was going to pick up Congress by the scruff of its neck and shake some action out of it,\"he writes.\"I had hoped for a tougher Obama. I had hoped for an Obama who was weary of his open hand being smacked away time and again by the closed fists of Republicans in the House.\"\n\nCommentators on the right also noted Mr Obama's milder tone, calling it evidence that Mr Obama's ability to exert influence in Washington is waning. \n\n\"The press had been prepped to believe the president would come out swinging tonight, defying Congress and vowing to seize the reins of government into his own hands,\"writes Commentary's Jonathan S Tobin.\"But what the country heard instead was confirmation of what many had already suspected after a disastrous 2013 for the president: he has passed over the historic bridge from celebrated re-election to the status of an irrelevant lame-duck.\"\n\nThe National Review's Jonah Goldberg agrees:\"My general impression was this was a remarkably boring speech, intellectually and rhetorically. Not every idea was terrible. But no idea was particularly exciting, or all that significant. Because it lacked ambition, it was a far less offensive speech that I thought it would be.\"\n\nDaily Caller's White House Correspondent Neil Munro writes that the heart of the problem is that at this point in his term, the problems the US is facing are of the president's own making.\n\n\"President Barack Obama is offering himself as the miracle cure for his own failed policies, even though his polls remain at dangerously low levels, the economy has stalled, and the public's 2008 hopes have changed into near-80 percent pessimism,\"he writes. \n\nThe emotional peak of Mr Obama's speech came near the end, when he recounted the story of Cory Remsburg, a US soldier who was gravely injured during his 10th tour of duty in Afghanistan. The veteran received one of the longest standing ovations in State of the Union history.\n\nBlogger Andrew Sullivan writes that Mr Obama used Mr Remsburg's story to maximum effect:\"The metaphor of the soldier slowly, relentlessly, grindingly putting his life back together was a powerful one for America - and Obama pulled off that analogy with what seemed to me like real passion.\"\n\nNot everyone was happy with the episode, however.\n\n\"There is no more serious decision that a government makes than to send its citizens a war,\"writes Nick Gillespie for Time magazine.\"And there is nothing more disturbing than a president using soldiers' sacrifices as a way of selling a grab-bag of domestic policy agenda items.\"\n\nAs with any major political event, it's worth noting that the intended audience wasn't the pundits in Washington, it was the American people. Countless polls will be taken over the coming days and weeks to see what effect Mr Obama's words had on public opinion and what it could portend for the elections in November.\n\nIf the results of a focus group of 44 Denver residents conducted by Democracy Corp is any indication, the president's message may have resonated. According to a memo by Stan Greenberg, James Carville, Erica Seifert and Scott Tiell accompanying the survey's results: \n\nThere is much here to commend the President's performance. He made major gains on having good plans for the economy, looking out for the middle class, and looking out for the interest of women. And in focus groups following the speech, voters gave him high marks on his push for paycheck fairness, minimum wage, education, student loans, and job training. Even Republicans in our audience responded positively to Obama's plan for paycheck fairness. \n\nThe Washington Examiner's Byron York contends that Republicans ignore findings like these at their own peril:\n\n\"The bottom line is that the group in Colorado - swing voters in a swing state - responded much more positively to the substance of Obama's speech than the horde of lawmakers, aides, tweeters and talkers in Washington,\"he writes.\"That is something Republicans in particular should note as they shape their agenda for 2014 and campaign in the months before this November's elections.\"\n\nWith his Tuesday night speech, Mr Obama didn't re-invent the State of the Union address, as some had hoped. He appears content to play the hand he's been dealt, as both sides manoeuvre to turn winter gloom into fall glory.\nTL;DR: On a snowy Tuesday night in Washington, President Barack Obama's fifth State of the Union address reflected the chilly reality of US politics in 2014.\n\nArticle: David ShukmanScience editor\n\nThis is the jet stream and its path is the cause of the repeated flooding being suffered during a British summer that has so far been one of the most miserable on record.\n\nIt was first identified by Japanese researchers in the 1920s, and then experienced firsthand by American aviators flying new high-altitude bombers in World War Two.\n\nThe jet stream, a massive but mysterious driver of our weather, usually passes along a steady path from West to East across the Atlantic - sometimes a bit to the North of us, sometimes a bit to the South. \n\nAs a relatively small island, on the borderline between the Atlantic Ocean and the European continent, the precise location of the stream matters hugely to us and right now we're on the wrong side of it. \n\nThis giant flow of air is the result of a constant play of forces across the planet as energy passes from the warmer tropics to the cooler polar regions - and its basic direction is governed by the spin of the Earth.\n\nWhat matters is where we are in relation to the stream as it surges overhead, particularly when its flow is not a neat curve but a series of massive meanders, like a river approaching the sea.  \n\nUnfortunate location\n\nOur misfortune now is to be on the northern side of those meanders where conditions are cooler and wetter which means we in Britain keep getting hit by rain.\n\nThe bigger the meanders, the greater the chance of giant pockets of cooler, wetter air being drawn south, starting to rotate and so initiating the process that leads to storms. \n\nHowever if you read this in the US, much of which lies to the south of the jet stream, your temperatures have been soaring because the air on that side of the line is far more settled. \n\nNormally, we would expect the pattern of the jet stream to keep shifting, for its shape to switch every few days and for our weather to change as a result.\n\nInstead for week after week - and possibly for weeks ahead too - the meanders of the stream are sticking to the same shape so repeated rainstorms have become the norm.\n\nBig unknown\n\nThe implications are depressing. Without some unexpected force altering the stream's pattern, it looks set to continue for a while yet.    \n\nThe big unknown is why this current pattern is so static. The high-altitude winds that make up the stream are themselves still racing along but their path remains stuck in place so our battering continues.\n\nThis is one of the major puzzles for weather specialists and the science behind this is fairly young. \n\nDr Mike Blackburn of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading admits that the reasons for a static pattern of the flow remain unclear.\n\n\"We haven't discovered why the meanders get locked into position as they are now,\"he told me.\n\nOne attempt at an explanation involves so-called Rossby Waves, named after the Swedish meteorologist Carl-Gustav Rossby whose research was published back in 1939.\n\nThis is no comfort as the forecasts continue to be grim, but it is a measure of the complexity of the physics involved - how air moves in waves, why certain patterns form - that more than 60 years later scientists are still wrestling with the question of how the jet stream operates and what shapes it.\n\nDr Blackburn and his colleagues studied the pattern of the jet stream during the floods in June and July 2007 and found it to be similar in appearance to now.\n\nSo it seems that if it gets locked into the wrong position, with a pattern of large waves, heavy rain is the result. \n\nClimate change\n\nOn top of this, there is the related question of climate change. Most researchers are extremely reluctant to attribute any single weather event to global warming.\n\nBut Dr Peter Stott, a leading climate scientist at the UK Met Office, says that since the 1970s the amount of moisture in the atmosphere over the oceans has risen by 4%, a potentially important factor.\n\nThat does not sound like much but it does mean that extreme rain storms may bring more rain than before - with more moisture in the air, what goes up must come down, and the odds are worse.\n\n\"That could make the difference between a place getting flooded or not getting flooded,\"he said. \n\nSo there are no exact answers, just some important strands in the science and a lot more research still needed to understand exactly why our weather is so bad. \n\nWhen I rang the BBC Weather Centre this morning and said I wanted to talk about the rain, a colleague answered with a single word, as if the constant storms were her fault:\"sorry.\"\nTL;DR: If you want something to blame for the appalling weather, look up as you raise your umbrella and imagine that high above the rain clouds a great river of wind is flowing through the upper atmosphere.\n\nArticle: Officers followed a BMW and a Mercedes driving erratically to the B7068 at Lockerbie.\n\nThe Mercedes and its two occupants were then traced near to Lockerbie High Street. \n\nThe BMW was discovered abandoned in a field near Haas Farm where police dogs helped track down the driver.\n\n'Good work'\n\nA 28-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with drugs and road traffic offences. \n\nHe is expected to appear in court on Monday.\n\nTwo other men, both aged 26, were arrested and released pending further inquiries.\n\nDumfries and Galloway road policing officers began tailing the cars during a routine patrol on the M74 Glasgow to Carlisle at about 13:30 on Saturday.\n\nDet Sgt Andrew McDowall said:\"This recovery, and the good work involved from road policing officers and our dog unit, shows that criminals may try to evade us, but we will use every tool and tactic at our disposal to remove illegal drugs from our communities.\"\nTL;DR: Police have recovered cannabis valued at \u00a3210,000 after two cars failed to stop during a routine patrol on the M74.\n\nArticle: By Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC News\n\nMoves are under way to try to detoxify the issue. But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody?\n\nAs Frank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the\"officers' group\"- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. \n\nThat meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism.\n\nIn July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. \n\nThe new code incorporated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016.\n\nBut crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11\"contemporary examples\"of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work.\n\nLabour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force.\n\nFor instance, the IHRA says that\"Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\"is an example of anti-Semitism. \n\nLabour's code says members should\"resist\"using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that\"such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party\".\n\nThere was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too.\n\nThe Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. \n\nWhile open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: \n\n\"Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.\"\n\nThey say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel.\n\nBut with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader.\n\nIt also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document.\n\nOpponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier.\n\nBut his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations.\n\nWill this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples.\n\nBack in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be\"IHRA plus\"- the\"plus\"being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate.\n\nHe suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016.\n\nIt recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum:\n\n\"It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.\"\n\nIt is possible the NEC will take this approach.\n\nBut there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the\"racist endeavour\"example of anti-Semitism.\n\nIt is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated.\n\nAnd the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members.\n\nSome Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome.\n\nEuan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first.\n\n\"For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,\"he said in a statement.\n\n\"If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise.\"\n\nConference pressure\n\nSo some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week.\n\nLabour sources say there is a\"three-month rule\"at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period.\n\nI'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. \n\nThat, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event.\n\nIt's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed.\n\nNonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. \n\nA demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue.\n\nIt doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. \n\nLast week the Camden group passed the following motion:\n\n\"The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'.\"\n\nAlso on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. \n\nRule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference.\n\nReselection battle\n\nBut what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs.\n\nBut some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference.\n\nThey are calling for\"open selections\"- in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change.\n\nMomentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged.\n\nBut if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise.\n\nI'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so.\n\nThe influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs.\n\nLabour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split.\n\nAnd very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest.\n\nAs politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism.\nTL;DR: A bitter internal row about anti-Semitism has dominated media coverage of the Labour Party throughout the summer - and the leadership is keen to ensure it doesn't drown out the party's message at its annual conference next month.\n\nArticle: Argentine director Lucrezia Martel, who is chairing the festival's jury, said she did not want to\"congratulate\"the director and that his participation in the festival made her\"uncomfortable\". \n\nPolanski, who is wanted in the US after admitting to sex with a minor in 1977, did not attend the screening.\n\nJ'Accuse (An Officer and a Spy) stars Oscar-winning actor Jean Dujardin.\n\nMartel later stressed she had no\"prejudice\"against Polanski's film, and would see it after the gala premiere.\n\nThe film is a historical thriller telling the true story of French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus, who was falsely accused of treason in the 19th Century.\n\nDujardin plays a French officer who uncovers evidence that Dreyfus was framed, and who risks his life to expose the truth.\n\nPolanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles in 1977, but then fled the US.

Some observations had suggested it was a very primitive body, little changed since its formation (a so-called C-type asteroid).  \n\nOther measurements, though, had spied what appeared to be metals in its surface, indicating the rock might have undergone a greater degree of evolution (M-type asteroid). \n\n\"Only when we've had a good look at the infrared data from Rosetta will we be able to say something about that,\"said Dr Rita Schulz, from the European Space Agency.  \n\n\"The spectral information stored in the infrared will give us the minerals.  When we clearly have these results then we can say,'this is Lutetia's type',\"Rosetta's project scientist told BBC News.\n\nWhat is in little doubt from July's spectacular pictures is the beating Lutetia has taken.  Impact after impact from other space rocks has ground up the surface to leave a deep regolith, or\"soil\".\n\nThis is immediately evident from the way the outline of some craters is softened, and almost completely obscured in some cases, by overlying debris.\n\n\"People have calculated that for an object of this size most of debris ejected from an impact would fall back on to the surface,\"explained Dr Schulz.  \n\n\"The escape velocity of a 50km-radius body - that's Lutetia - would be 60m/s.  And that would mean 90% of the material trying to get off the asteroid would fall back, and that could explain this blanket.\"   \n\nAt closest approach during the flyby, the resolution in Rosetta's pictures was about 60m per pixel, more than sufficient to pick out remarkable details on its surface.\n\nScience team-members are still in the process of counting craters, scarps, pits, ridges, and places where landslides have taken place.  Almost 240 boulders of minimum size 100m have been identified.\n\n\"Because the asteroid is so big, there is so much to find and we're still doing an inventory,\"said Dr Schulz.  \n\n\"For instance, we've now finished putting a grid on the asteroid to give coordinates for every feature.\"\n\nRosetta is currently heading further out into the Solar System and is set to rendezvous next with a comet in 2014.  \n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk\nTL;DR: Lutetia, the giant asteroid visited by Europe's Rosetta probe in July, is covered in a thick blanket of dusty debris at least 600m (2,000ft) deep.\n\nArticle: There has also been 13 fire damaged in mid and south Wales since 2006.\n\nThe findings are revealed by GoSafe, the road safety group which manages Wales' cameras.\n\nIn one incident a camera column in Hawarden, Flintshire, was wrenched from the roadside by rope tied to a vehicle.\n\nAnd another in nearby Mynydd Isa was sawn up with the bits left on the road.\n\nIt is thought disgruntled motorists are to blame for some of the damage as people caught speeding incur fixed penalty fines.\n\nThere have been 32 incidents of damage to speed cameras reported since 2004 in north Wales, according to a Freedom of Information (FoI) request by Clwyd South AM Ken Skates.\n\nGoSafe has since revealed there have been 28 other incidents in mid and south Wales since 2006.\n\nDeliberate damage\n\nIn north Wales, the figures show a minority of cases have involved accidental damage in road collisions.\n\nHowever, officials believe the camera on the A5104 at Pontybodkin, near Mold, was deliberately driven into in 2008, causing damage.\n\nJim Moore, GoSafe partnership manager, said:\"The irresponsible people involved should realise the cameras are put in place to protect road users and to save lives. \n\n\"Any cameras that are damaged or vandalised will incur an unnecessary financial cost to repair the camera and could result in a fatal or seriously injured road user, as cameras are only placed where somebody has been killed or seriously injured.\n\n\"There is a simple message - cameras are in place to save lives, not to make money.\"\n\nGoSafe manages Wales' speed cameras in a partnership involving the nation's 22 unitary authorities and its four police forces, among others.\n\nThe FoI request says that even though no fixed camera technicians have been attacked, they have received verbal abuse along with colleagues working as mobile camera technicians.\n\n\"Mobile camera operators have received verbal abuse, gesticulations and had members of the public banging on the vans,\"says the document.\n\n'Tougher action'\n\nThe camera worst affected in north Wales is located on the A525 at Coedpoeth, near Wrexham. \n\nIt has been struck six times with damage caused to the front of the lens box and paint thrown over it.\n\nIn the latest attack in 2008, there was an attempt to set it on fire - leading to two arrests.\n\nIn the south, there have been two incidents this year with one in Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Pontypool, Torfaen.\n\nIn all, there are 152 fixed camera sites in Wales with only 12 in north Wales;

Economic stimulus\n\nLavish spending often accompanies a wedding, and so a large increase in the number of marriages taking place each year would create a significant boost to certain parts of the economy. \n\nBeneficiaries might include ceremony venues, cake manufacturers, function band agencies, and hoteliers. \n\nThe government estimates the total economic stimulus could be as much as \u00a314.4m - but thinks it is more likely to be closer to \u00a30. \n\n\"As the demand for same-sex marriage is uncertain, and because these economic benefits are not guaranteed to be additional (for example, the spending on a civil partnership or marriage ceremony may not be additional if the couple and guests cut back on spending in other areas), we use zero benefit as our best estimate,\"it explains. \n\n2. Transgender spouses and the law\n\nAlso facing increased demand for its services is the Gender Recognition Panel, which furnishes transgender people with certificates documenting their gender transitions. \n\nAt present, it is impossible for a member of a married couple to change gender and remain legally married. \n\nSo the government is anticipating a\"noticeable increase\"in the panel's workload as\"those who may have changed gender some years ago but decided not to apply for legal recognition, since they wished to remain in their existing marriage\", adapt to the change in the law.\n\n3. Health benefits\n\nDuring its consultation on same-sex marriages, the government received evidence from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which said lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (LGB) people experience more mental health problems and a greater likelihood of drug addiction than heterosexuals. \n\nMinisters believe that discrimination against LGB people partially accounts for this phenomenon. \n\nThe removal of discrimination against same-sex couples in the current legal definition of marriage, the government argues, might therefore improve public health. \n\n4. IT upgrades\n\nA number of Whitehall departments will need to tweak their computer systems to enable them to administer services properly to same-sex married couples. \n\nThe biggest impact will be felt at the Home Office, which oversees the registration of marriages, civil partnerships, births and deaths. \n\nThe government estimates that necessary changes to its online registration system will cost \u00a32m. \n\nLower costs will fall on the Department for Work and Pensions, which will need to adapt its systems to cope with changes to pension entitlements, and the Ministry of Justice, which will need to alter the courts'\"FamilyMan\"IT system.\n\n5. Tourism boost\n\nIf the government's plans become law, the UK will join a select group of 12 countries where same-sex marriage is legal. \n\nThe Lesbian and Gay Lawyers Association told the government in its consultation to prepare for a\"modest boost\"in tourism as a consequence. \n\n\"We are aware that same-sex couples from the UK travel to places like Canada to get married because they prefer this to a civil partnership. We expect that if marriage is open to same-sex couples in England and Wales, couples especially from elsewhere in Europe will come here to get married here,\"it said. \n\n6. Re-training registrars\n\nThose who will be conducting same-sex marriages will need to get to grips with the new system. \n\nThe government assumes that they will need between two and seven hours' training each -\"time which could have been spent on other tasks\", it notes.  \n\n7. Who to tell and how\n\n\"Currently, if a person discloses that they are in a civil partnership rather than a marriage, they automatically disclose their sexual orientation,\"the government says. \n\nPeople in same-sex marriages will have greater discretion over how, when, or whether to divulge this information. \n\nRecent research suggests that one in five LGB people think they have been harassed at work because of their sexual orientation, the government says. \n\n8. Societal benefits\n\nSame-sex marriages might encourage greater acceptance of same-sex couples in society, the government believes. \n\nThis would be good for society as a whole, ministers have concluded, by helping to create\"a more inclusive society where there is more choice and acceptance\".\nTL;DR: MPs debate plans, opposed by many religious groups, for same-sex marriage next week. Ahead of that occasion, the government has published its  assessment  of the possible wider impacts. Here are eight ways it believes the bill might change things:\n\nArticle: By Helen  BriggsBBC News\n\nThe chick lived 127 million years ago and belonged to a group of primitive birds that shared the planet with the dinosaurs.\n\nFossils of birds from this time period are rare, with baby fossils seen as\"the rarest of the rare\".\n\nScientists say the discovery gives a peek into the lives of the ancient, long-extinct birds that lived between 250 and 66 million years ago.\n\nThe bird belonged to the enantiornithine family, most of which had teeth and clawed fingers on each wing, but otherwise looked much like modern birds. \n\n\"It's amazing to realise that many of the features we see among living birds had already been developed more than 100 million years ago,\"said Luis Chiappe, from the LA Museum of Natural History.\n\nMinute matter\n\nFrom nose to tail the hatchling was a bit shorter than the little finger of a human hand, and it weighed just 10 grams.\n\nThe bird died not long after leaving the egg, giving a window into a critical stage of development. \n\nResearchers from the UK, Spain, Sweden and the US used state-of-the-art technology to study its fossilised bones.\n\nAnalysis in a synchrotron - particle accelerators that use very intense light to study minute matter - revealed that the chick probably could not not fly at this stage.\n\nThe cartilage in its sternum (breast bone in the centre of the chest) had not yet fully turned to bone.\n\nLead researcher Fabien Knoll of ARAID-Dinopolis and the University of Manchester said analysis of bone development can be used to study a host of evolutionary characteristics.\n\n\"New technologies are offering palaeontologists unprecedented capacities to investigate fossils,\"he said. \n\nThe fossil was found many years ago in the famous Las Hoyas site in Spain. However, it has remained largely unstudied until now.\n\n\"Truth be told, the techniques we used to analyse it in the paper (such as synchrotron microtomography and elemental mapping) had not yet been developed when the specimen was discovered,\"said Dr Knoll. \n\nStudying the process of bone development can explain a lot about a young bird's life and development. These early bird chicks may have been much like modern chickens, which have feathers and can move around from birth. \n\nOr they might have been more similar to living love birds, which hatch with no feathers and their eyes shut, meaning they need parental care.\n\nThe research, published in the journal, Nature Communications, suggests the enantiornithines were very diverse in their behaviour and development.\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.\nTL;DR: Scientists have unveiled one of the smallest bird fossils ever discovered.\n\nArticle: Simonstone Hall in the Yorkshire Dales shared a picture of the plaque, donated by a hotel guest, on Facebook.\n\n\"Here lies the BBC career of Jeremy Clarkson who had a fracas on this spot, 4 March 2015,\"reads the plaque.\"The rest is legend.\"\n\nClarkson was suspended, then dropped, by the BBC following the incident.\n\nThe Top Gear team were staying at the hotel during filming when Irish producer Oisin Tymon was assaulted by Clarkson during a late-night argument over food. \n\nTymon suffered swelling and a split lip and visited a hospital for his injuries. \n\nFollowing an internal investigation, the BBC announced Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.\n\n\"We were presented with this plaque from one of our guests last night!\"wrote Simonstone Hall, sharing a picture on social media.\n\n\"We think it would be quite appropriate to put it on the patio where the fracas took place!\"\n\nEarlier this month it was revealed Tymon is suing Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination, centring on\"verbal abuse\"he said he received from the presenter during the fracas.\n\nClarkson will front a new show on Amazon Prime with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond in the New Year, while Chris Evans will host the new look Top Gear when it returns for a new series.\nTL;DR: The scene of Jeremy Clarkson's infamous fracas with a BBC Top Gear producer has been commemorated with a plaque at the hotel where the altercation took place.\n\nArticle: China says the support base will be used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and West Asia.\n\nIt will also be used for military co-operation, naval exercises and rescue missions, Xinhua said.\n\nChina has ramped up investment in Africa, as well as rapidly modernised its military in recent years.\n\nThe Xinhua report said the ships departed from the port city of Zhanjiang in China's southern Guangdong province on Tuesday.\n\nIt did not specify the number of troops or ships that departed for Djibouti, nor when the base would start operations.\n\nThe report said the Djibouti base came after\"friendly negotiations\"between the two countries. Previous reports said construction began last year.\n\nThe base is widely seen as a move by China to stake its military presence in the region.\n\nBut an editorial (in Chinese) on Wednesday in the state-run Global Times said that the\"essential purpose of China's development of its military might is to protect'China's safety', and is not about seeking to control the world\".\n\nThe newspaper pointed out that the US, Japan and France also have military bases in Djibouti.\n\nDjibouti, a tiny country at the Horn of Africa, is favoured for its location as it sits near a busy shipping route. It is also seen as a stable country in an otherwise volatile region.\n\nIn 2015, at a major summit with African nations, China pledged to invest $60bn (then \u00a340bn) in Africa's development. \n\nBesides becoming the continent's largest trading partner, it has also poured in funds and manpower for infrastructure projects.\n\nMany of them are railways linking up African countries, including one that connects Djibouti with the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, as well as railways in Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.\n\nIn return, Africa supplies China with natural resources, minerals and energy. \n\nChina also embarked on its first foreign peacekeeping mission in South Sudan in 2015.\nTL;DR: Ships carrying Chinese troops are heading to Djibouti to set up Beijing's first overseas military base, reports state media.\n\nArticle: By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter\n\nBetween December 2009 and December 2016, line rental prices had increased by as much as 49% for some customers, the regulator said.\n\nAnd of the people with standalone landlines in their homes, 71% were aged 65 or over.\n\nOfcom recently revealed plans to make BT - with nearly 80% of the UK market - cut line rental costs by \u00a35.\n\nA huge proportion (43%) of the 2.9 million households with a landline only are occupied by people aged 75 and over.\n\n\"Older consumers are particularly affected, as they are more likely to be dependent on fixed voice services if they do not have a mobile phone or an internet connection,\"the report said.\n\nOfcom also said it was\"concerned\"BT's low cost option for landline-only customers on certain qualifying benefits -

that's a struggle for everybody - but if you're new to using a computer or tablet, you can be thrown when things change,\"Ms West told the BBC.\n\nBut while vulnerable people still faced difficulties and rising costs associated with some of their services, those who used home broadband and mobile data plans were getting an increasingly better deal, a separate Ofcom report on pricing revealed.\n\nSome of the changes highlighted include:\nTL;DR: Recent increases in line rental charges have hit elderly people the hardest, according to  an Ofcom report .\n\nArticle: State news agency KCNA described the device, fired into the Sea of Japan, as a\"surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile\". \n\nSouth Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump.\n\nNorth Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned. \n\nThe US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. \n\nChina said it opposed North Korean missile tests and Russia said it was concerned, calling on all parties to prevent any escalation in tensions. \n\n'Great satisfaction'\n\nKCNA said the missile, named the Pukguksong-2, was a\"new type strategic weapon system\".\n\nIt said the missile used a solid-fuel engine, which gives ballistic missiles greater range and means they can be readied for launch faster than liquid-fuel missiles.  \n\nIt was a new version of a missile test-fired from a submarine in August 2016 and was fired in a high arc in consideration of neighbouring countries, the report said.\n\nKim Jong-un\"expressed great satisfaction\"over the test launch, which added\"to the tremendous might of the country\", the state news agency said.\n\nNorth Korea said that the missile could be tipped with a nuclear warhead.

They are either too lazy, they don't have the men, or they have a policy against it.\n\n\"Where it hasn't been done for years and the heather is up to waist height, it's really bad. If you drop a match, it just goes.\n\n\"I'd say people should actually be made to do it and prosecuted if they don't.\"\n\nThe suggestion is strongly disputed by the organisation which represents 2,500 landowners across Scotland.\n\nFarming decline\n\nLuke Borwick, chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, said:\"It is disappointing to hear how our landowning members are being unfairly blamed for this situation.\n\n\"Our members are well used to adhering strictly to the [Muirburn] code.\n\n\"Some of these fires have been as a result of careless activity by recreational access takers.\"\n\nHe said members were willing to create a chain of wildfire defence, and had been volunteering their resources to help fire crews.\n\nThe decline in hill farming in recent years could also be partly to blame.\n\nA study commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage in 2011, focused on the north Highlands, western Scottish Borders and the Isle of Skye, found that Scotland's sheep flock fell by nearly 2.9 million between 1998 and 2009.\n\nWhere livestock numbers had fallen and land was under-grazed, there was deterioration in vegetation and spread of bracken - all of which can exacerbate wildfires.\n\nStretched to the limit, the fire service called for a stop to further controlled burning this year, saying conditions were\"clearly unsuitable\".\n\nLandowners who fail to heed the advice could face prosecution.\n\nBut for some, not burning back the land could have serious consequences.\n\n\"I've been waiting for the right weather, but this may mean I'll have to wait for next year,\"said crofter Ms Wilkinson.\n\n\"If the hills don't get burned, there's less area for the cattle to graze.\"\n\nBloodsucking ticks\n\nHill farmer Pete Webster said long heather also created a breeding ground for ticks.\n\n\"They can literally drain animals of blood,\"he said.\n\n\"If you have a lamb that's six to eight-weeks-old covered in ticks, it can die of anaemia.\"\n\nTicks also carry diseases, including Lyme disease, a bacterial infection affecting humans. If left untreated, it affects the skin, joints, heart and nervous system.  \n\nMs Wilkinson believes it is essential that the public understands the importance of the annual Muirburn as a way of controlling the land.\n\n\"You just have to go on Facebook to see the comments and the anger because people don't understand controlled burning,\"she said. \n\n\"The headlines don't help.\n\n\"It can look dramatic, but done properly, controlled burning is so beneficial and actually stops the spread of wildfires in future years.\"\nTL;DR: The past week has seen dramatic images of wildfires lighting up the skies in the Highlands. \n\nBut who is to blame for the hill fires? And how will the fire service's ban on further \"muir burning\" this year affect farmers and estate owners?\n\nArticle: Vendors who delete negative online reviews or post fake positive reviews face a minimum $30,000 (\u00a323,000) fine. \n\nThe new law aims to clean up China's internet shopping websites just before Singles Day - the country's busiest online shopping day of the year. \n\nLast year's Singles Day saw sales worth almost $18bn (\u00a313.7bn) in 24 hours.\n\nChinese consumers placed 657 million orders. \n\nMost Singles Day vendors sell through the online platform Alibaba, which has been heavily criticised for failing to police the claims some sellers post about their products. \n\nChinese vendors'exploiting' African children removed from Taobao\n\nHow China's Alibaba wants to change shopping\n\nSingles Day: Alibaba breaks record sales total\n\nSocial media in China: how is it different to the West?\n\nThe authorities are also trying to stop the use of a technique known as brushing - when vendors stage fictitious sales in order to boost their standing in website search results.\n\nChina in August launched a digital\"cyber-court\"to help deal with a rise in the number of internet-related claims, including online shopping disputes.\n\nSingles Day is held every year on 11 November. The day is also referred to as Double Eleven because of its date.\n\nOriginally claimed as a celebration for China's young singletons, Alibaba turned it into a shopping bonanza in 2009.\n\nWhile Alibaba is undeniably the driving force behind the event, other retailers have also started to piggyback off the idea, including extending it to Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nIn August Alibaba reported strong earnings, posting a 56% rise in quarterly revenue.\n\nAnalysts say that Asia in general and China in particular are at the centre of the global shift towards e-commerce.\nTL;DR: China has created a new law to impose heavy fines on internet shopping websites which publish false advertisements about their products.\n\nArticle: Fire crews were called to the Grade II-listed former Fisons warehouse on Paper Mill Lane, in Bramford, near Ipswich, at about 05:00 BST.\n\nNo one is thought to have been hurt, but the building, dating back to 1858, was destroyed by the blaze.\n\nIan Bowell, from Suffolk Fire and Rescue, said there was\"no obvious natural cause\"for the fire.\n\n\"I have to say quite confidently that we are treating this as arson,\"he said.\n\nAbout 60 firefighters from both Suffolk and Essex fire services were called to the blaze, which is thought to have started in a smaller building before spreading to the wooden main factory building.\n\nEfforts to fully extinguish the fire are expected to go on for most of Monday and people living nearby have been told to close their windows and doors.\n\nSamantha Pemberton, who lives opposite the scene, said she and her family were\"met by a wall of fire\"when they looked outside.\n\n\"There were embers bigger than the size of your hand falling,\"she said.\n\n\"It was like walking onto the set of a disaster film.\"\n\nPaper Mill Lane was closed between Bramford and Claydon.\n\nFisons, a now defunct fertiliser company, operated at the site until 2003.\n\nIn 2014, a plan to turn the site into a \u00a320m housing and business park was approved by councillors, but work had not begun.\nTL;DR: A suspected arson attack at a derelict Victorian fertiliser factory was likened to \"a disaster film\" scene.\n\nArticle: By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York\n\nBut the US small business owner is now battling Apple for the right to use a pear in the logo on her recipe app.\n\nIn a legal filing, Apple said the image was too similar to its own logo and would hurt its brand.\n\nMs Monson says the tech giant is simply\"bullying\"and she feels a\"moral obligation\"to fight back.\n\nMore than 43,000 people have already signed the petition she and her husband Russ, owners of the Super Healthy Kids website, created last week to try to pressure the company to back down. \n\n\"This is a real world example of a small business being destroyed by a giant monopoly because they don't have accountability,\"Mr Monson told the BBC.\"That was so frustrating to us that we thought we had to do something. We can't just be the next victim on the list.\"\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment. \n\n'Similar commercial impression'\n\nIn its filing with the US patent and trademark office, the firm says the Monsons' pear logo\"consists of a minimalistic fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind Apple's famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison\". \n\nIt asks regulators to reject the Monsons' trademark application, which the couple first filed in 2017 on behalf of their recipe and meal planning app, Prepear.\n\nMs Monson said the comparison took them by surprise. The shape of the pear and leaf, which they worked on with a designer, was supposed to allude to the letter\"P\"in the app's name, she said. \n\n\"We had no intention or any awareness that it was copying any logo at all,\"she said.\"We thought it was very unique and designed it to be so.\"\n\n\"First we were very surprised and then I would say our second reaction was definitely scared,\"she added.\"Like,'ok where do we go from here? What does this mean?'\"\n\n'You wonder if it's a joke'\n\nWhen the Utah-based couple started planning Prepear five years ago, they envisioned the app as a platform where food bloggers could upload recipes, which subscribers could access to plan meals and create shopping lists.\n\nThey now have about 21,000 monthly active users, including 3,000 customers who pay the annual $59 fee, according to Mr Monson, an accountant by training. The app, along with the Super Health Kids site, supports five staff, including the couple.\n\nMr Monson said he initially thought it was a misunderstanding and the two sides would be able to resolve the dispute amicably. The logo has been approved in other countries, including the UK, without dispute and American patent officials hadn't found a problem, he noted.\n\nAs a final step before approval, the patent office published their application in late 2019 drawing Apple's objection.\n\n\"It just seems so ridiculous on its face,\"he said.\"You wonder if it's a joke.\"\n\nLast week, as it became clear that it was not, the couple spoke out on social media, drawing attention to other instances of Apple's trademark objections and noting that concerns about legal costs had prompted them to let go one of their employees.\n\nTheir story was picked up by iPhone in Canada and has since spread, drawing fresh attention to debates about whether tech giants are abusing their powers.\n\n\"We're honestly overwhelmed by how supportive people have been,\"Mr Monson said.\"It's incredible to see how many people share the same frustration that made us decide to take this public.\"\n\nSome of the people reaching out have offered legal and design help, so Mr Monson said he has no plans to back down in the fight anytime soon.\n\n\"We're going to take it all the way,\"he said.\nTL;DR: When Natalie Monson started her food blog 11 years ago, she didn't expect to end up embroiled in a fight with the world's most valuable company.\n\nArticle: Tarkan Agca, 24, of Crusader Way, Watford, entered his plea at Winchester Crown Court where he had been accused of murdering Andy Szaruta.\n\nMr Szaruta, of Bridgwater, Somerset, died in hospital after the crash near Solstice Park, Amesbury, in June. \n\nJudge Mrs Justice May adjourned the case until 10 January for sentencing. \n\nKerry Maylin, prosecuting, described how Mr Szaruta was travelling with his wife Susan and daughter Rachel along the A303 near Stonehenge in Wiltshire, heading to London for a Father's Day and birthday celebration with their son, Christian.\n\nShe said Mrs Szaruta described how Agca\"tailgated\"behind them, prompting her husband\"to tap his brake to indicate the BMW shouldn't be so close\".\n\nMrs Szaruta said the BMW then undertook them before\"squeezing\"in front of them and braking so hard that it was like an\"emergency stop\".\n\nMs Maylin said the two drivers then pulled over to a slipway by the A303 Solstice Park services and Mr Szaruta walked over towards the BMW, where he was hit by the car and thrown into the air.\n\nShe said Mr Szaruta's daughter witnessed the incident and told police:\"My dad had his hand on the bonnet, he went up on the bonnet and high up into the air.\n\n\"Dad was carried a car length on the bonnet.\"\n\nMs Maylin said another witness saw Agca driving away\"far in excess of the 70mph limit\"and\"skipping between cars\".\n\nThe court heard Agca had 13 previous convictions for 28 offences, with several relating to road rage incidents which involved tailgating and attacking vehicles.\n\nIn a statement, Mrs Szaruta said she suffers flashbacks and added:\"I have lost my husband, my best friend and have to cope with the trauma of what happened.\"\n\nDuring his military career Mr Szaruta had gained medals for serving in the Falklands War, two tours in Northern Ireland, and a NATO medal during the Bosnian war.\nTL;DR: A man has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of an ex-Royal Marines sergeant who he hit \"high into the air\" with his BMW in a road rage attack.\n\nArticle: Susanne Wilkinson was sued by Michael Black and John Morgan from Cambridgeshire after she refused to let them share a double bed.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed a challenge to the ruling, but gave Mrs Wilkinson, from Berkshire, permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is due to be heard on 9 October.\n\nThe case will be heard at the same time as that of Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who refused to let Martyn Hall and Steven Preddy share a bedroom at their seaside guesthouse in Cornwall.\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nMr Black, 64, and Mr Morgan, 59, from Brampton near Huntingdon, had booked and paid a deposit for a double room at the Swiss Bed and Breakfast in Cookham.\n\nWhen they arrived, Mrs Wilkinson made it clear she was not prepared to allow them to share a double bed, and that she would not accommodate them.\n\nMs Wilkinson, a Christian, said her religious beliefs dictated her decision.\n\nLawyers for Mrs Wilkinson argued that a person offering bed and breakfast in their own home was entitled to refuse to allow people who were not married or in a civil partnership to share a double bed.\n\nThe couple are not in a civil partnership. In these circumstances, there was no direct or indirect discrimination, Mrs Wilkinson's lawyers said.\n\nMr Black and Mr Morgan's case was taken up by lawyers from the human rights organisation Liberty.\n\nThey argued it was unlawful for a person concerned with the provision of services to the public to discriminate against a person on the grounds of their sexual orientation.\n\nMrs Wilkinson was ordered to pay more than \u00a33,500 in damages last year after a court in Reading decided the couple had suffered unlawful discrimination.\nTL;DR: A bed and breakfast owner has lost her appeal against a ruling that she unlawfully discriminated against a gay couple.\n\nArticle: By Rebecca MarstonBusiness reporter, BBC News\n\n\"I'm studying, so I can work when I want and for how long I want to. There aren't really any downsides for me at the moment,\"she says.\n\nHannah works for Deliveroo, one of the best-known companies in the business thanks to protests by drivers in the summer against proposed changes to the way they are paid.\n\nShe is part of a growing army of such workers. \n\nAccording to new research by global consultants McKinsey, the popular concept of work as a traditional nine-to-five job with a single employer bears little resemblance to the way in which a substantial share of the workforce makes a living. \n\nThe McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimates that the independent workforce is some 162 million people, up to 30% of the working-age population in the United States and most of Europe. Official UK figures bear this out, with almost five million people in the UK employed in this way.\n\n'Reluctant and strapped'\n\nThe report looked at the full spectrum of ways in which individuals earned income outside traditional employee roles. It says independent workers fit into four key segments: \n\n'Downside'\n\nHannah Jones picked up this casual way of working after losing interest in her job in corporate finance and deciding to study for a Master's degree in developmental psychology. \n\nShe reckons she fits into two of the categories. \n\nShe has savings from her previous well-paid finance job, but still needs to top that up. Essentially, she's a casual who is earning supplemental income. She is also a\"reluctant\"in the sense that her aim is for a traditional job in the mental health field. \n\nAppropriately, perhaps, she mentions the mental health upside to working outdoors delivering on her bike:\"I've been outdoors all summer, it's been great for producing endorphins.\"\n\nBut there are plenty who find there are downsides to working for companies like Deliveroo, Uber and any of the other companies that pull together workers with services.\n\nAlthough workers are classed as self-employed, some companies expect their workers to be freely and regularly available, to such an extent that there is no time to work for anyone else.\n\nMeanwhile, they get none of the benefits, such as sick pay and pensions, that workers for other companies do.\n\nSolutions\n\nFrank Field MP has called such practices\"bogus self-employment\". He is among those who want a parliamentary inquiry into this new world of casualisation. \n\nMcKinsey says its survey found the majority of independent workers in all countries participated by choice and were attracted by the flexibility and autonomy.\n\nBut it says solutions will need to be found to the problem of benefits, income security and training, whether that be through government or new technological innovation of the type that created these platforms in the first place.\nTL;DR: The \"gig economy\" suits Hannah Jones.\n\nArticle: Empire gives you points allowing you to move up life's ladder by doing things like rapping in a battle, making a mixtape, or getting a job to pay for new bling. \n\nOnce you've earned enough points, you can move out of the housing projects and into playground of the rich and famous.\n\nThe game is still in the development stages but the beta version of it was launched this week.\n\nThat is where the public can try out the game and give creators feedback before the general launch. \n\nThere is no date yet for the official release. \n\nIt's estimated Jay-Z is worth $460 (\u00a3284) million thanks to his recent Watch The Throne tour - which will come to the UK at the O2 Arena in London on 20 March.\nTL;DR:",

In such a moment\"fortunes are made,\"says Dr van Es, a fellow of St Catherine's College. \n\nInstead of acting out a caricature of a starving author, Shakespeare was now able to buy property and lend other people money.\n\nThis also changed the trajectory of his writing, says Dr van Es, whose research has been published in a book, Shakespeare in Company.\n\nHe had the financial security to develop his own literary voice and themes and no longer had the\"breadline existence\"of having to compromise to meet the whims of rich sponsors.\n\nThis close relationship with one theatre company allowed him to develop characters for particular favourite actors, giving him much more artistic control over how the plays might be performed.\n\n\"Shakespeare is known as the first playwright with deep, distinctive characterisation and I believe he developed this because of his relationships with the company's principal actors,\"says Dr van Es.\n\nHe also says that surviving play manuscripts from the Elizabethan era show how much scripts were likely to be changed.\n\nHe likens it to the way a Hollywood film might be very different from the original script - and that Shakespeare was unusual in getting control of the production process.\n\nHis financial stake in the theatre also meant that as well as impressing a fashionable aristocratic audience he also had to make sure that the plays had a popular appeal to keep the crowds coming back.\n\n\"He was writing for a mass audience, but also for the court,\"says Dr van Es. The outcome he says is the\"high-low hybrid\"that characterises his plays.\n\nThis new way of looking at the playwright's career - from treading the boards to the board room - also shows how different Shakespeare was from his contemporaries, says Dr van Es.\n\n\"There is no one else like Shakespeare in his income and control,\"he says.\nTL;DR: William Shakespeare was the first great \"writer entrepreneur\" and his financial success gave him artistic independence, an Oxford University researcher claims.\n\nArticle: By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland news website\n\nEdinburgh's tram\"network\"is now just part of one of the original lines, stretching from the airport to the city centre. It had been intended to reach the waterfront at Leith and Newhaven, and there were to be other lines too, but they fell away as the troubled project rumbled on.\n\nThe idea of bringing back trams to Edinburgh's congested streets goes back many years but the current saga can be said to have begun in September 2003.\n\nBack then the Labour-led Scottish Executive earmarked \u00a3375m, indexed for inflation, for the proposed tram routes linking the city centre with both Leith and Edinburgh Airport. It was hoped trams would be operational by 2009.\n\nNow, more than five years behind schedule, Edinburgh has trams on its streets for the first time since 1956 but just one route, not the network that was envisaged.\n\nThe 8.7mile (14km) route stretches from Edinburgh airport to York Place in the city centre, with 15 stops along the way.\n\nIt has cost of \u00a3776m, plus more than \u00a3200m in interest on a 30-year loan taken out by the council to cover the funding shortfall. \n\nIt is something of a miracle it ever got finished at all, given the disputes along the way.\n\nThe entire project was going to be scrapped by the SNP when the Nationalists formed their first minority government at Holyrood in 2007, only for the decision to be overturned by the will of the other parties in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nAnd four years ago a bitter dispute between the arms-length company responsible for bringing trams to Edinburgh and its main contractor brought the whole project to a halt for months.\n\nWhen David Mackay quit as chairman of Transport Edinburgh Limited he branded the project\"hell on wheels\". \n\nMr Mackay described the main contractor on the tram works, Bilfinger Berger, as a\"delinquent company that smelled a victim\".\n\nDuring the darkest days of the dispute, the German construction giant said nothing publicly due to contractual restrictions. \n\nBut there is little doubt that Bilfinger Berger's executives were similarly left frustrated and angry by TIE's handling of the project.\n\nAdd to all this the fact that vital roads in Edinburgh city centre and Leith were dug up for the best part of seven years, causing congestion, inconvenience and financial harm to businesses and it is little wonder that the dream of a tram system to rival any in Europe is now such a painful idea for the people of Scotland's capital.\n\nAs Edinburgh's elegant streets were transformed into a giant building site, initial scepticism was replaced by downright opposition.\n\nIt is often said by locals that Edinburgh has one of Britain's best bus services but the city council developed a new transport plan at the start of the millennium and trams were a priority.\n\nAt first the tram project was dependent on the revenues from a road-charging scheme that the City of Edinburgh Council wanted to implement, similar to that introduced in London in 2003.\n\nBut when the controversial road tolls were rejected after a public outcry, the tram scheme sailed on, backed by cash from the Scottish government of the time. \n\nBy September 2005, as the parliamentary bills for the line made their way through Holyrood the cost was put at \u00a3539m.\n\nThe new estimates of cost prove too much for the council which shelved the Granton-Newhaven and Edinburgh airport-Newbridge sections.\n\nIn March 2006 the legislation was passed in parliament, with completion now put back to 2011 and the first work to divert utility pipes and cables in Leith began in March 2007.\n\nBut work stopped as the Scottish Parliament elections arrived and in May 2007, the new SNP administration at Holyrood tried to press ahead with its pledge to scrap the trams project.\n\nHowever, opposition parties outvoted the minority government and it was forced to hand-over almost \u00a3500m for the project.\n\nThe Scottish government's finance secretary John Swinney said he would give the project the cash already agreed and\"not a penny more\". Any further cash would have to be found by the City of Edinburgh Council.\n\nConstruction could now begin and a whole new range of problems arrived.\n\nThe city centre was left gridlocked when work began on Princes Street at The Mound due to a\"catastrophic failure\"of traffic management and similar stories bubbled up wherever the tram works went.\n\nPrinces Street, the main route through the centre of Scotland's capital, remained closed to traffic for most of 2009, an annus horribilis for the project.\n\nA dispute between Tie, which was overseeing the project, and the construction consortium spiralled out of control and a legal dispute dragged on for many months, putting back the finish of the project and driving up costs.\n\nIn October 2010 council officials admitted the tram line would only run to St Andrew Square in the city centre, the plan to continue to Leith and Newhaven bit the dust.\n\nNext the chairman of the Edinburgh tram company resigned and work ground to a complete standstill. \n\n2011 saw some sort of resolution with the contractor but a fresh crisis emerged as the council realised it did not have the money to complete the project.\n\nEdinburgh's city council came up with a plan to stop the line at Haymarket, more than a mile west of the city centre, a decision which was labelled as\"bonkers\"by the city's Chambers of Commerce.\n\nThe Scottish government had to wade in again and refused to provide the final \u00a372m of its funding if the line did not go to the city centre, forcing the council into a u-turn.\n\nIn contrast to the troubled history of the project its final two years have been relatively smooth, although by this stage it was hard to imagine what else could go wrong.\n\nConstruction of the line was finished at the end of last year and testing of the trams has been going on for several months.\n\nNow Edinburgh is ready to get on-board its trams for the first time. \n\nBut the people of Edinburgh may take some time to love them.\nTL;DR: Trams will return to Edinburgh's streets for the first time in almost 50 years, when the service begins on Saturday. However, in the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as was first thought.\n\nArticle: The Milwaukee-based firm now expects to sell between 241,000 and 246,000 bikes this year, down from 262,221 last year.\n\nDemand has been dropping for years. A decade ago it was selling almost 350,000 annually.\n\nHarley is also facing competition from cheaper bikes made by rival US firm Polaris and Japan's Honda.\n\nIn a BBC interview earlier this year, the boss of the firm, Matthew Levatich, said his iconic motorcycle company was\"emblematic\"of what the Trump administration thought a home-grown US company should be.\n\nBut in its second quarter results, published on Tuesday, the company said sales would be down sufficiently for it to need to cut production, and workers' hours, at some of its US plants.\n\nHarley-Davidson demand has weakened among its aging baby-boomer customers and fewer millennials are taking to motorcycling.\n\nPart of the reason for the fall in demand is that its loyal customers are ageing, and, as they do, they sell their bikes, dampening the appetite for new vehicles.\n\nDespite this, the company said it was not looking to cut new bike prices in the face of these lower used-bike prices.\n\nHarley has tried to counter its image as a high-cost, older age group brand and has introduced a number of models at the lower price range aimed at younger riders.\n\nAcross the US, big bikes are falling from fashion. Figures released last week show registrations of large motorcycles fell by about 7% so far this year. \n\nHarley-Davidson's second quarter net income was down almost 8% at $258.9m (\u00a3198m).\n\nRevenue per motorcycle rose about $437 to $15,530 in the quarter.\nTL;DR: Shares in Harley-Davidson are down about 8% in New York after the motorcycle maker slashed its sales forecast for this year.\n\nArticle: Speaking from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts after her team's victory over Pakistan, Chamani Seneviratne said that Sri\n                  Lankan team lacks international exposure though some other countries get regular international encounters.\n               \n\n\"I hope that ICC would increase the number of international matches we play as we do not have facilities like in countries\n                  such as Australia and New Zealand,\"she told the BBC Sinhala service, Sandeshaya.\n               \n\n\n\"I think ICC could make a request for other countries to offer more matches to smaller countries and prepare a just schedule\n                  for women's internationals.\"\n               \n\nICC response\n\nSri Lankan women secured a thrilling one-run victory over regional rivals Pakistan in their first encounter at the  ICC women\u2019s\n                  Twenty20 World Cup, but lost to India and New Zealand at the same round.\n               \n\n\n\n\n\"India for example have played new Zealand before but the last time we met New Zealand was the Twenty20 World Cup in England\n                  last year,\"Chamani Senevirathne explained.\n               \n\nThe ICC earlier re-organised the Future Tours Programme for men's internationals after coming under pressure especially from\n                  the sub-continent. \n               \n\nThe ICC, however, says it is the responsibility of the relevant cricket board to arrange their own international fixtures\n                  for women.\n               \n\n\"They (countries) must play a certain number of matches to meet the minimum requirements in women's cricket,\"ICC Communications\n                  Officer James Fitzgerald told BBC Sinhala service. \n               \n\n\"The ICC actually offered teams ranked 5 - 10 (which includes Sri Lanka) invitations to compete at the Women's Cricket Challenge\n                  in Dubai in October 2010, but Sri Lanka was the only team to turn the offer down.

Treatments can lessen the symptoms, but scientists are looking for ways to prevent, halt or reverse the disease. \n\nAs the dementia progresses, more plaques (clumps of abnormal proteins and chemicals) form in the brain and healthy brain cells die off.\n\nScientists reason that preventing or removing the plaques might help, and many drug candidates are in development.\n\nSome drugs still being tested appear to stop the plaques from forming - but that is if it taken early enough, before the disease has advanced. \n\nHowever, the South Korean researchers believe they may have found a molecule, called EPPS, that could work even if plaques have already formed. \n\nThey gave EPPS to mice (bred to have the Alzheimer's plaques) by spiking their drinking water for two weeks, and then monitored them over the next three months to see what effect it might have. \n\nCompared with a control group of mice who received only normal water, the EPPS mice performed better on memory and learning problems (running through a maze). \n\nThe EPPS mice also had far fewer plaques in their brain at the end of the trial than they had had at the beginning. The same could not be said for the control group.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Society and Alzheimer's Research UK said it was important to remain cautious - animal study findings may never apply to humans.\n\nProf Tom Dening, an expert in dementia research at the University of Nottingham, said:\"From a clinician's point of view, this research is of interest, but we still don't know if removing amyloid plaques is useful in humans. \n\n\"It may well be that the appearance of plaques is too far down the chain of molecular processes to be beneficial.\n\n\"We don't know if this animal work will lead to any useful agent that can be used for clinical trials.\"\nTL;DR: A molecule can clear Alzheimer's plaques from the brains of mice and improve learning and memory, Korean scientists have found in early tests.\n\nArticle: By Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News\n\nThe robots are inspired by the ancient Japanese art of origami. \n\nThey are made from flat layers of material; some of these are rigid and hold their shape, while others are made of a heat-shrinking polymer. \n\nEmbedded elements within these layers provide heat, allowing the robot to self-construct. \n\nThe advance is reported in the journal Science. \n\nThe Harvard team say this origami-inspired engineering could allow people to make complex objects and devices much more cheaply and easily. \n\n\"I'm sure people have seen in examples of origami - you can use folding to create fantastically complex structures,\"said Harvard professor Robert Wood, who led the research. \n\n\"But once the complexity of these things exceeds a threshold, folding them by hand becomes painstaking.\"\n\nSo he and his team, including collaborators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wanted to demonstrate the power of folding by designing a complex machine that could fold itself.  \n\nThe team created a flat-layered design, including self-folding hinges that were controlled by embedded heating elements. \n\n\"We [incorporated] motors and batteries while it was flat,\"explained Prof Wood. These powered the final robot's walking motion.\n\nProf Wood, who is also part of Harvard's Wyss Institute for biologically inspired design said there were a huge number of applications for devices that self-fold. \n\n\"Imagine self-deploying structures - maybe shelters or structures for space exploration or for satellites,\"he told BBC News.  \n\n\"Things where the logistics are difficult, like humanitarian aid in war zones.\"\n\nHe said the team also wanted to inspire a\"maker mentality\"and give people more tools to build complex devices. \n\n\"It's a similar theme to 3-D printing,\"he said. \n\n\"We're trying to provide tools for people - whether they're engineers or not - to build complex structures for whatever they want.\"\n\nUK-based aerial robotic expert Dr Mirko Kovac from Imperial College said the work was an excellent example of robotics research that had the potential to improve our lives. \n\n\"The principle of folding self-assembly is a step changing approach to robot design,\"he told BBC News. \n\n\"It allows non-experts to build mobile robots quickly and at very low cost. \n\n\"In future, such robots could even be made of biodegradable materials and be deployed in swarms to monitor and protect vulnerable ecosystems.\"\n\nFollow Victoria on Twitter\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nMIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nHome Wyss Institute at Harvard\nTL;DR: Researchers in the US have developed self-folding robots that are able to take shape and crawl without human intervention.\n\nArticle: Reece Yates died at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in April last year after being delivered 10 weeks early.\n\nAn inquest at Ruthin concluded that the infant died of natural causes.\n\nHis parents Darren and Melissa Yates said they hoped other babies\"can live on\"through the lessons learned through their tragedy.\n\nThe inquest on Tuesday heard the unborn child's condition had started to deteriorate when his mother's waters broke at 20 weeks. Reece was born 10 weeks later.\n\nReece's parents Darren and Melissa Yates said they had been given the impression that if he had been born at Arrowe Park specialist neonatal unit in Wirral, there was every chance the baby would have survived.\n\nDr Nick Nelhans, clinical director of paediatric services at the Wrexham hospital, said:\"We can never know.\"\n\nBut the doctor said communications between paediatricians and obstetricians had improved since the death.\n\nPatricia Gaskell, solicitor for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, added:\"The health board's position is Reece's chances of survival would have been better if he had been born at an alternative unit.\n\n\"That is something the board does stand by.\"\n\nCoroner John Gittins said:\"Things could have been better in terms of the outcome and steps have been taken by the health board to address those issues.\"\n\nIn a statement after the inquest, the baby's parents said they were in\"no doubt\"that the care their child received in Wrexham was\"the very best that could have been given\"on that day.\n\nThe couple said they welcomed recommendations made by the health board following Reece's death.\n\n\"We thank the doctors who treated Reece with such skill for their professionalism and care,\"they added.\nTL;DR: A premature baby would have had a better chance of surviving at a specialist unit, health officials have accepted.\n\nArticle: The 2,000-seat Portsmouth Guildhall will be used by the University of Portsmouth to allow face-to-face teaching until the end of the year.\n\nThe city centre venue, close to the university campus, has been closed since the beginning of the lockdown with staff furloughed.\n\nThe university said it was an\"exciting and creative solution\".\n\nUnder the contract, the university will use the main auditorium as well as 10 smaller rooms which would normally host concerts and conferences.\n\nThe rooms will be\"repurposed\"for teaching with Covid-secure measures such as one-way systems put in place.\n\nThe Guildhall Trust, which manages the venue, said the plan would offset some of the\"significant losses\"it was forecasting for the financial year.\n\nChief executive Andy Grays said:\"We are delighted that an alternative use has been found in these unprecedented times.\"\n\nThe university's deputy vice-chancellor, Bernie Topham, said:\"This is an exciting and creative solution to challenging circumstances, giving us extra space to host safe and engaging face-to-face teaching which we know is valued by our students.\"\n\nThe council-owned building, opened in 1890 and rebuilt after suffering bomb damage during World War Two, still houses the council chamber and civic meeting rooms.\nTL;DR: A concert venue is to be used for teaching university students in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArticle: A counter at thepiratebay.se showed a countdown to 1 February, but it appears to have come back online a day early.\n\nThe website, which provides links to pirated content, was taken offline following a raid in Sweden in December.\n\nPolice officers seized servers in Stockholm after a complaint was filed by a group called the Rights Alliance, which targets internet crime.\n\nThe police operation took place in an area in Nacka, south-east of Stockholm, with the area's cold weather used as a natural cooling system for computer servers.\n\nThe site was taken down in 2006 after another raid by police but reappeared online three days later. \n\nThe Pirate Bay is one of the internet's most-visited websites, and the film, music and software industries blame it for losses running into billions of pounds.\n\nInternet service providers (ISPs) in the UK were ordered by the High Court to block access to the site in 2012. \n\nIn October Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Warg was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for hacking into computers and illegally downloading files.\n\nAnother co-founder, 35-year-old Peter Sunde, was arrested in Sweden last year after two years on the run and was sentenced to eight months in prison for violating copyright laws.\n\nMeanwhile a third co-founder, Hans Fredrik Lennart Neij (known to hackers as TiAMO), was arrested while trying to cross into Thailand from Laos in November.\n\nA message from\"Winston\"on the newly-relaunched site reads:\"So, first we ditched the trackers.

We have started the conversation and now we need action,\"she said.\n\n\"It is better for everyone in society when we go to work with a fair wage.\"\n\n'Wary'\n\nWhen the issue of gender pay was discussed in the Commons in 2018, the-then Minister for Women, Tory MP Victoria Atkins, said the government wanted\"a foundation of data before considering whether or how to change the current requirements\". \n\nShe told MPs:\"Let us have a couple of years of reporting at the higher level and with big companies, which have human resources departments that can deal with this, with the hope that it trickles down... to smaller employers as well.\"\n\nThe Institute of Directors said greater transparency about gender equality in the workplace was welcome but it had to be balanced against the\"burden\"increased pay reporting would place on smaller businesses. \n\n\"At this difficult time, many small firms will be wary of extra demands on their resources, which may already be stretched to the limit,\"said Dr Roger Barker, its director of policy and corporate governance.\n\n\"While we would encourage smaller companies to publish this data on a voluntary basis if feasible, we are concerned that imposing new obligatory reporting requirements on SMEs would be a step too far at the current juncture.\"\nTL;DR: Businesses with 100 employees or more should publish their gender pay gap data, according to a group of MPs.\n\nArticle: Pictures of the blaze at All Saints' Church in Mackworth, Derbyshire, show significant damage to the roof of the Grade I listed building.\n\nChurch warden Prof Bryan Jones said he felt\"absolutely numb... watching 1,000 years of history go up in flames\".\n\nDerbyshire Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the blaze was unclear but the possibility of an arson attack was being investigated.\n\nClive Stanbrook, from the service, said the roof had collapsed and there was\"extensive\"damage to the interior.\n\nSix crews were sent to Lower Road just after 16:30 GMT and remain at the scene, he said.\n\n\"We're doing all we can to try and save the external shell of the church,\"he said.\"It is tragic for the area.\"\n\nMr Stanbrook said it was too early to establish the cause, but a number of suspected arsons at schools and fires at churches over the past few months meant a thorough investigation had been launched. \n\n'Gutted'\n\nVicar Jacqueline Stober said:\"I'm absolutely devastated. It's a terrible thing that has happened.\n\n\"It's an absolutely beautiful church. This year we were planning on celebrating its 700th anniversary but we had to delay that because of Covid.\n\n\"I can guarantee that worship has happened here for a thousand years and there will be, in some form or other, worship here for the next one thousand years.\"\n\nLocal auctioneer Charles Hanson said he was\"gutted\"at learning of the blaze.\n\nHe tweeted:\"I married here, loved ones are buried here.

There were reports of violence by police.\n\nThe country's electoral commission said Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, won more than 80% of the vote, triggering weeks of protests in the former Soviet republic.\n\nSeveral hundred people attended Mr Lukashenko's swearing-in ceremony at the Palace of Independence on Wednesday, with many streets of Minsk sealed off.\n\nThe guests were mainly loyal officials and apparently no foreign dignitaries had been invited. One opposition member described it as a\"thieves' meeting\". \n\nAs well as the 27-member European Union, the US also rejected the results of the election. But Mr Lukashenko continues to be supported by neighbouring Russia, his most important ally. \n\nWhat is the EU saying?\n\n\"The European Union does not recognise their falsified results.

Failing schools will face closure.\n\nEducation Minister Leighton Andrews said teachers themselves could face annual literacy and numeracy assessments as part of their training.\n\nIt follows a series of highly critical reports into Wales' education system.\n\nAt a speech in Cardiff, Mr Andrews promised to raise standards and said young people\"deserve better\".\n\nThe system for grading all schools will be operated by local councils. Mr Andrews said people need information about how their schools were performing, but that it would not mean a return to league tables.\n\nFrom next year, no school will pass inspections unless it can show its governing body has discussed performance data and set in place actions to improve.\n\nMr Andrews said:\"Where a school is found to be failing, and I regard the situation to be irredeemable, I will close it.\"\n\nA national literacy plan, including reading tests, will be designed to make sure fewer pupils fall behind their reading age.\n\nThe plan will focus on seven-to-11-year-olds, will involve catch-up reading programmes and will stretch the most able pupils.\n\nSimilar plans for numeracy will be developed by the start of the 2012-13 academic year.\n\nThe minister has recently been critical of what he called a\"systemic\"failure in the education system after Wales was shown to be slipping down a worldwide league table.\n\nThe Pisa international assessments of 15-year-olds found Wales lagging well behind the rest of the UK - and the minister wants Wales to be in the top 20 of Pisa-ranked nations by 2015.\n\nMr Andrews has also asked officials to revise initial teacher training so it becomes a two-year masters course.\n\nThere will be a statutory requirement on all qualifying teachers to be trained in literacy and numeracy.\n\nOne teacher training day a year will focus on literacy and numeracy assessment for all teachers.\n\n\"I expect all teachers to be teachers of literacy,\"said Mr Andrews. \n\n\"Pisa has demonstrated that our classrooms are not delivering for our young people. Too few are able to apply the skills they are learning. We need to look again at initial teacher training and at continuous professional development.\"\n\nHe said Wales had introduced many of the changes that teachers wanted during a decade of devolution, including abolishing league tables and Sats.\n\n\"But if we believe in the comprehensive model in Wales then we have to make sure that it delivers for all our children,\"he said.\n\n\"The evidence of Pisa is that it is not. Performance has fallen back.\"\n\n'Dangerous principle'\n\nBut Plaid Cymru - Labour's coalition partners in the assembly government - said failing schools should not be\"abandoned\".\n\nThe party's education spokeswoman Nerys Evans said:\"The principle that any school should be beyond redemption or cannot be turned around is a very dangerous one.\n\n\"I am of the firm opinion that no matter how bad things get, with the right leadership and the right teachers, working together with the local community, any school can be turned round.\"\n\nShe said she\"broadly welcomed\"several of the minister's proposals, but added she was concerned his plans were not\"adequately ambitious\".\n\n'Admission of failure'\n\nLast month, the schools inspectorate Estyn warned standards were not good enough in nearly a third of schools.\n\nIt came a day before new figures revealed councils in Wales spend an average \u00a3604 less on each pupil compared to councils in England.\n\nConservative education spokesman Paul Davies said:\"People will be forgiven for being a little cynical of a relaunch of Labour's education policies weeks before an election when Labour politicians have been running the education system in Wales for 12 years.\"\n\nWelsh Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Jenny Randerson said:\"This statement today, which has had to be prised out the education minister, is a response to two damning reports and it is clearly an admission of failure by the Labour-led administration over the past decade.\"\nTL;DR: National reading tests are to be introduced as part of a shake-up to Wales' schools system announced by the education minister. \n\n\n\nArticle: A statement issued on their behalf said the decision was\"the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship\".\n\nIt confirmed they had separated and will share custody of their children Savannah, nine, and Isla, seven.\n\nBoth of their families were\"sad\"but\"fully supportive\"of the decision to\"co-parent\", the statement added.\n\nThe couple told the Queen and other Royal Family members about their decision last year.\n\nMr Phillips, 42, is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. \n\nHe is the eldest grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n\"The decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one,\"the statement read.\n\nIt added:\"Peter and Autumn have requested privacy and compassion for their children while the family continues to adapt to these changes.\"\n\nMr Phillips met Canadian management consultant Autumn Kelly, 41, at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003, while he was working for the Williams Formula 1 team.\n\nThey married in 2008 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle - where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding would take place ten years later - and brought up their children in Gloucestershire.\n\nBefore the wedding, Mrs Phillips gave up her Catholic faith - a move which, because of rules on royal successions that were later changed, allowed Mr Phillips to retain his right to the throne.\n\nWhile Mr Phillips is a member of the Royal Family, he is not a working royal and does not have a title.\n\nLast month the Daily Mail revealed that he featured in a Chinese television advert endorsing milk from Jersey cows.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Queen was photographed at King's Lynn station in Norfolk, where she was returning to London following her winter break at Sandringham.\nTL;DR: The Queen's grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn have announced they are to divorce.\n\nArticle: The 26-year-old, who became the first-ever UK rapper to top the Worthy Farm bill, said his in-ear monitors failed in the early part of his set.\n\nThis meant he couldn't hear himself for most of the performance.\n\nDespite producing a thrilling and thought-provoking set, he walked off stage thinking he'd\"blown it\".\n\n\"The thing about Glasto, and I've not told anybody this, but I had no sound,\"he told Q Magazine.\n\n\"My in-ears blew after about 20 minutes, so I had no sound for the whole thing. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done.\n\n\"When I walked off stage, I thought I'd [ruined] it. I thought it was the worst thing I'd ever done.\"\n\nHe added:\"I came off stage and thought I'd totally, absolutely, blown it. I was crying for, like, an hour. I was in hysterics.\n\n\"I thought I'd [messed] it up. Heartbroken, man. Heartbroken.\"\n\nAll right on the night\n\nThe performance tackled institutional and historic racism in the criminal justice system and in the arts.\n\nWearing a Banksy-designed Union Jack stab-proof vest, he ripped through tracks from his number one debut album, Gang Signs & Prayer, and a cover of the UK garage classic, Sweet Like Chocolate.\n\nAs well as bringing out Coldplay's Chris Martin, and fellow London rap stars Dave and Fredo to perform their number one single, Funky Friday.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until he spoke to festival organiser Emily Eavis afterwards that the artist - whose real name is Michael Omari - realised his big night had in fact gone\"all right\", he explained modestly.\n\n\"Then after calming down for an hour,\"he went on,\"Some of the people at the festival, Emily Eavis and that, gave us a memory stick to watch it back.\n\n\"And I got about halfway through and I was, like,'[Oh], I think it all went all right'.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Stormzy, announced his second album, Heavy Is The Head, will be released on 13 December.\n\nThe album's cover image, posted to his 2.6 million Instagram followers, sees the bare-chested star wearing a crown and looking down at the aforementioned Banksy-designed stab vest from his June show.\n\nThe record, which features the likes of Ed Sheeran, Burna Boy, Yebba, H.E.R. and Aitch, closes with his one of his latest number one singles, Vossi Bop.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It is the Mercury Prize ceremony in London in 2007. No-one is sure whether Amy will turn up, let alone perform.\n\nThen she creeps onto the stage and into the spotlight and the ballroom falls silent. Pin drop time.\n\nShe sings Love is a Losing Game, backed by one man with an acoustic guitar. It is a stunning performance. Sensational. Spine-tingling. The stuff legends really are made of.\n\nHer voice is charged with pain and her jazzy delivery serves to deepen the sense of soul and personality. It is an emotional sucker punch.\n\nThen she looks lost. She mumbles a couple of barely audible words into the microphone - probably\"thank you\"- and shrugs.\n\nOn climbing down from the stage, she moves to her table, embraces her father Mitch and sits between him and her then husband Blake Fielder-Civil. The couple spend the rest of the night with their arms draped around each other.\n\nThousands of people will be replaying similar memories of the power of seeing Amy perform.\n\nThere are other memories, like the time when she arrived at the nightclub, was ushered into the DJ booth, promptly started a fight with the DJ and was ushered straight out again.\n\nThen, there was the time when she appeared to punch a fan in the front row who reached out to grab her during a set at the Glastonbury festival.\n\nThat was the other side of Amy. \n\nBut unlike most of the people she rubbed shoulders with in the gossip columns, there was a real talent behind the infamy.\n\nOn her second album Back To Black, hers is the eternal voice of love and loss, the tortured soul in the tradition of Aretha Franklin or Billie Holiday.\n\nShe was an individual who had broken the record industry's mould for modern, anodyne pop stars.\n\nAnd hers was a forthright voice that reflected her fiery nature, refusing to go to rehab, sticking up for her man, warning:\"I told you I was trouble.\"She was no victim, except to her own success and addictions.\n\nHer story was told in great tunes that were given a timeless feel thanks to the homage to 1960s R&B girl groups. Songs like Rehab and Back To Black are genuine pop gems that will go down as classics.\n\nSongwriting partners and producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi helped ensure those songs appealed on many levels.\n\nSongwriting struggle\n\nThere are other memories. There was the time in the early hours of one February morning in 2008 that she performed in Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, west London, for a live video link with the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nUnable to travel to the US due to visa issues, she jumped up and hugged her mother Janis as she won five awards, with the crowd in LA chanting her name.\n\nShe was a global star, one of the rare singers whose burning artistry was allied with massive commercial and critical success.\n\nBack To Black was released in 2006. In October 2009, I spoke to the head of her record label Island, who said her follow-up would\"hopefully\"be released in 2010.\n\n\"I've heard a couple of song demos that absolutely floored me,\"Island co-president Darcus Beese said. He said the singer had been writing and recording\"in fits and starts\". \n\nAt that time, producer Remi said the pair had\"about four songs done\".  Lucian Grange, head of Island's parent company Universal Music Group, said her new material was sounding\"sensational\".\n\n'Most natural voice'\n\n2010 has come and gone and there has been no new album. She contributed a track to a Quincy Jones tribute album and even popped up as a backing singer for her goddaughter Dionne Bromfield.\n\nShe recorded a duet with the legendary singer Tony Bennett, for an album that is out in September.\n\n\"Of all the contemporary artists I know, she has the most natural jazz voice,\"he told The Guardian recently.\"But I'm worried about her and I'm praying for her.\"\n\nHer personal problems were legendary - especially her addictions to alcohol and drugs.\n\nThe infamy overtook the artistry and she seemed unable to get well enough to live up to the legend she had become.\n\nAround the BBC\n\nBBC - Music - Amy Winehouse\n\nRelated Internet Links\n\nAmy Winehouse\nTL;DR: Amy Winehouse, who has died at the age of 27, was much more than the tabloid caricature she became - she was one of the most talented and soulful artists of her age.\n\nArticle: Stephon Clark was shot a total of eight times in the confrontation on the night of 18 March in Sacramento, California, said a forensic pathologist. \n\nDr Bennet Omalu said seven of the bullets entered the 22-year-old father-of-two's back and side.\n\nHe was holding a mobile phone, which police said they mistook for a gun.\n\nHis death has sparked city-wide protests.\n\nDr Omalu said Clark was also hit in the neck and thigh, and one shot resulted in a punctured lung.\n\nAuthorities said that each officer fired 10 times. Any one of the eight bullets that struck Clark could have proved fatal, Dr Omalu said.\n\n\"His death wasn't instantaneous,\"Dr Omalu said at a news conference on Friday. \n\nIt took him three to 10 minutes to bleed to death.\n\nDr Omalu said the seventh gunshot wound was to the side of his body, towards the back.\n\nHe said:\"You can reasonably conclude he received seven gunshot wounds from his back.\"\n\nSacramento police said the officers were responding to reports of a thief who damaged three vehicles in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe suspect was seen from a helicopter breaking the glass door of a house before hopping over a fence next door.\n\nThe officers confronted Clark in his grandmother's backyard.\n\nBody camera footage shows it was dark as they ordered him to show his hands before opening fire after shouting:\"Gun, gun, gun!\"\n\nThe video shows the officers stayed at a distance weapons drawn and pointing at the victim until backup arrived.\n\nWhile discussing whether to perform CPR, one officer said:\"Hey, mute.\"The audio went silent for two minutes.\n\nClark's family and their lawyer are questioning why he did not receive more immediate medical care. They are expected to file a federal lawsuit. \n\n\"These findings from the independent autopsy contradict the police narrative that we've been told,\"said Benjamin Crump, the family's lawyer.\n\n\"This independent autopsy affirms that Stephon was not a threat to police and was slain in another senseless police killing under increasingly questionable circumstances.\"\n\nMr Crump said the post-mortem findings meant the officer's story about Clark moving towards them in a threatening manner could not be true.\n\nHundreds of mourners attended Clark's funeral on Thursday as demonstrators took to the streets.\n\nOn Tuesday, his brother, Stevonte Clark, stormed a city council meeting with protesters and said the authorities had\"failed all of you\".\nTL;DR: An unarmed US man killed by police this month was shot seven times in the back, according to an independent post-mortem examination.\n\nArticle: The two sides adjourned talks after two days of discussions on 24 and 25 April.\n\nThe row is over Southern's plans to give drivers responsibility for door operation and changing the role of guards to on-board supervisors.\n\nThe RMT has taken 31 days of strike action over the proposed changes. \n\nA spokesman for Southern said:\"I can confirm we will be meeting with the RMT next week but, at this stage, can't confirm the date.\"\n\nIn a separate dispute, members of drivers' union Aslef rejected initial proposals to resolve the row in February and this month voted against another proposed deal.\nTL;DR: Southern rail and the RMT union are to continue negotiations next week in a bid to resolve a year-long dispute over driver-only operated trains.\n\nArticle: Stephen Neasham, 37, shot his 26-year-old rival with a rifle before being driven away by Eric Smith, 65.\n\nNorthumbria Police said the man survived but it was\"millimetres from being murder\".\n\nNeasham was jailed for 20 years and Smith for 17 years at Newcastle Crown Court. Both were found guilty of attempted murder.\n\nThe jury heard Neasham, of Bewicke Main Caravan Park, Lamesley, Gateshead, had arranged to meet his victim in a back lane in Birtley on 21 March to sort out a dispute.\n\nHe turned up with a rifle and shot the man before being drive away in a white van by getaway driver Smith, who lived on the same caravan site as Neasham.\n\n'Mindless and cowardly'\n\nDet Insp Joanne Brooks said:\"This was a calculated, planned shooting and Stephen Neasham only had one thought in his mind.\n\n\"He wanted to end his victim's life at any costs and did not hesitate to pull the trigger when he turned up at that back lane that night.\n\n\"The bullet was millimetres from severing an artery and killing his victim and it is more by luck than judgement that he is not facing life behind bars.\"\n\nShe said Smith would\"spend his twilight years behind bars\"as he played a\"crucial role\"in the\"mindless and cowardly shooting\".\n\nDuring the trial, the victim told the court he had attended the meet\"alone and unarmed\"with the intention of sorting things out\"man to man\".\n\nBut jurors heard how Neasham leapt out of the van saying\"it ends tonight\"before shooting his victim in the pelvis area.\n\nNeasham must also serve five years on extended licence after his jail term.\n\nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

So it was at the Nato summit, and so it was during his visit to Britain. \n\nMr Trump used his interview in the Sun to throw a few plates at Theresa May, criticising her Brexit strategy, threatening to block a trade deal with the US, praising Boris Johnson. Cue outrage and much gnashing of teeth.\n\nThen came the news conference at Chequers where the president revealed he had apologised to the prime minister, praising Mrs May as an\"incredible woman... doing a fantastic job... a terrific woman\", insisting the UK-US relationship was\"the highest level of special\", all the while accepting that a trade deal might be possible just so long as there were no\"restrictions\"on US firms.\n\nAnd so it goes: the UK-US relationship settles back on to an even keel and life returns to normal. That, at least, is the hope of British officials. \n\nThey designed this trip to show Mr Trump the depth of the relationship between the UK and the US: the history of Blenheim and Churchill, the dinner with business leaders who create jobs in America, the special forces who co-operate in the fight against terrorism, the Queen who has met 11 of Mr Trump's predecessors. \n\nThe symbolism was clear: the ties that bind Britain to the US are long and deep.\n\nAnd government sources said the talks with Mr Trump at Chequers were good. They said the fallout from the Sun interview shaped the mood. \n\nAny discussion that began with Donald J Trump apologising put the other side in a stronger position. The conversation, I am told, was relaxed, detailed and covered all the issues from the Middle East to North Korea.\"It was good, solid, substantive stuff,\"said one source. \n\n\"We landed some messages.\"In other words, so they hope, the special relationship continues, Mr Trump's apology and recantation on trade enough to correct the damage of the interview in the Sun. \n\nBut is that really true? The president's words cannot be unspoken. He has described the UK as being in\"turmoil\", a\"hotspot with lots of resignations\".\n\nHe intervened directly in domestic UK politics, a gross breach of diplomatic etiquette. And even worse, he intervened in favour of the prime minister's opponents. \n\nThis was more than being undiplomatic to one's host: this was a hostile act that handed ammunition to those Brexiteers wishing to undermine the prime minister's Brexit strategy. \n\nAnd what is more, the president was plain rude: to Mrs May whom he criticised for ignoring his advice.\n\nAnd for good measure, Mr Trump said Britain was\"losing its culture\"because of immigration. \n\nUntil now, many British politicians tend to say things like\"focus on what Donald Trump does, not what he says\",\"ignore the tweets, stick to the substance.\"\n\nThey also say the special relationship is about more than how well the Oval Office gets on with Number 10: the core of the relationship, they insist, is the military, security and intelligence nexus. \n\nThey like to quote Winston Churchill's speech in Fulton, Missouri in 1946 when he popularised the phrase\"the special relationship\"which he described as\"not only the growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but kindred systems of society, but the continuance of the intimate relationship between our military advisers\".\n\nIn her prepared statement at Chequers, the first point Theresa May made was to highlight the importance of UK-US military co-operation around the world. \n\nMy question is this: how long can this security relationship continue when the political tensions are so great? \n\nHow long is it before the policy differences between the Trump White House and the May Downing Street begin to infect the institutional relationships - the diplomats, the soldiers, the spies - that normally stay immune from the poison of day-to-day politics? \n\nCan the two relationships really continue to exist in isolation? \n\nNote this: since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a travel ban on Muslims from some countries and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group. \n\nMr Trump has also questioned the multilateral, liberal rules-based order that Britain defends, while embracing the regimes of authoritarian\"strong men\". \n\nMr Trump wants to approach the world not through alliances but individual bilateral deals, a series of transactional relationships with other countries that balance short-term national interests. \n\nIn his mind, the UK may be just another country with which to deal. But at Chequers, Mrs May deliberately warned Mr Trump not only that it was their responsibility to ensure the transatlantic relationship endured, but also that it was based on the shared values of democracy and justice. \n\nSo there are two fundamentally opposed positions: Donald Trump's belief in an interest-based transactional relationship with the UK, where access to US markets is determined by how detached the UK is from EU markets, and Theresa May's view of a transatlantic relationship based on shared values. \n\nAnd the question remains: as the US and the UK drift further apart between these positions, how long can the institutional relationship between the soldiers and the spies survive the tensions of their political masters?\nTL;DR: This is how it works in Trump world. The US president arrives at a party, causes a fuss, breaks some crockery, and leaves everyone stunned.\n\nArticle: Wayne Ingold, 57, was not the intended victim of the attack, which happened outside his home in Witham, Essex, in August 2014.\n\nAarron Isaac, 19, of Elverson Road, Lewisham, and a 16-year-old boy from London - who cannot be named because of his age - had denied any involvement.\n\nBut a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court convicted them after a week-long trial.\n\nBoth defendants were told by Judge David Turner they would face a significant custodial sentence.\n\nDuring the trial, Mr Ingold gave evidence and said he had been checking the post box in the communal entrance of his block of flats when he saw figures moving.\n\nWhen he opened the door, the teenagers had a glass bottle full of liquid which they threw over him before running off.\n\n\"It [the acid] hit my hands, my face, my neck.

And the more people we got off, the lighter it was and the more unstable it became.\n\n\"We were absolutely fuel critical - the helicopter crew was signalling how many minutes we had left.\n\n\"When we got back we were literally on fumes.

He takes some ribbing about it from his school friends, but generally on the whole he is very proud of me. But it doesn't take away, if something goes wrong, I'm not there and that I do struggle with.\"\n\nThe former teacher said the election was so fast she had had little time to contemplate the impact on Jac, who has a different last name in a bid to keep his life as\"normal as possible\".\n\nShe said it was only now, when the Commons is in recess, that the reality of the situation has begun to set in.\n\n\"It was just a complete whirlwind from the start, everything has just been 100 miles an hour, it's been very fast. I've absolutely loved every second of it, but the reality is quite harsh.\n\n\"While this job is absolutely perfect for me, I feel my priority has always been my son, it's never been my career.\n\n\"I'm now in a position where I feel it is time for me to focus on my career, but I do feel very selfish as well.\n\n\"I feel guilty, if my son needs me or if he has issues, where am I?

I'm not complaining but it takes some organising.\"\n\nMr Williams said when he took the children to Westminster they received lots of attention and loved it because they\"get to eat sponge and custard in the cafe\".\n\nBut he said there had been pushback from some MPs about young children being brought to late-night votes and cabinet sessions and, while there was a nursery, it was not of any use to him as it was for long-term use.\n\n\"The fact that they have one is great, but it is more for people who live in London than for people such as myself.\"\n\nSarah Rees - 2016 assembly election candidate - mother of two\n\nWhen Sarah Rees stood as a candidate for the 2016 assembly elections, she took her then two-year-old daughter, Caitlin, out on the campaign trail. \n\nNow a mother-of-two, the deputy leader of the South Wales branch of the Women's Equality Party, said she would never have been able to stand without the party helping with her childcare costs.\n\nThe 36-year-old said:\"I concentrated on day times when she would be at nursery. I did evenings with other candidates and she would be in bed. \n\n\"In the recent election I did take both children out canvassing - Danny in a sling attached to me, at three months old, and Caitlin walking alongside.\n\n\"Your attention is constantly being taken from one to the other, so to try and hold a conversation with someone on the doorstep is again something on top and it did get quite difficult.\"\n\nMs Rees said she stopped taking the children out canvassing when one of the party's candidates in London received death threats, saying they were going to kill candidates.\n\nDarren Millar - AM for Clwyd West - father of two\n\nWhen he was first elected to the Senedd a decade ago, Conservative AM Darren Millar said he felt guilty for leaving his children for so long every week.\n\nMr Millar, whose children Mary, 17, and Toby, 14, were just infants at the time, said being away from his family home in north Wales had been\"pretty grim\".\n\n\"I suddenly became a parent who was around all the time to someone who was away four days a week.\n\n\"It makes you think'am I doing the right thing in getting involved, is it fair to Becky, who is effectively a single parent in the week?'\"\n\nHe said he could understand why so many politicians quit to spend more time with their families and he tried to get as much quality time with his children as possible.\n\n\"I simply couldn't do my job without Becky's support, I always try to get a Sunday off and carve that time out.\"\n\nRhianon Passmore - AM for Islwyn - mother of four  \n\nRhianon Passmore's children grew up surrounded by politics and her eldest daughter even followed in her footsteps to become a county councillor.\n\n\"I think I've been very lucky, because I've always been involved in politics in local government, so my children have grown up with the more chaotic timescales that are attached to life in politics.\"\n\nMs Passmore, who was elected to the assembly in 2016, said when she was a councillor she did not claim childcare expenses.\n\n\"Local government has structures in place so you can have a childcare support allowance, I never claimed that, and I think there has always been a stigma attached to whether or not you claim different allowances.\n\n\"I didn't claim it because I felt I needed to be the same as everyone else. In the past that has been the case for women in local government, but I would stress, I think that is definitely changing now.\"\n\nMs Passmore takes her youngest child, aged 10, to events at the weekends but said there were many which were not suitable for children.\n\n\"I think there is a very fine balance between how you interact with your children in public life and how you don't do that,\"she said.\n\n\"I think it is important that family life continues if you are in politics or in public life. \n\n\"Yes, it's a very great honour but I think it's very important that those who make policy are able to reflect on how these policies impact on families.\"\nTL;DR: Accessing childcare is expensive and one of the biggest issues facing parents in Wales.\n\nArticle: By Amanda BruckshawBBC News\n\nPete Townshend calls Quadrophenia a\"quintessentially English piece\". The music tells the story of Jimmy, a rebellious and conflicted teenager who searches for an identity, first in the characters of The Who, and then as a member of a gang of Mods. \n\nTownshend says:\"It's about a young man who sees himself in the four members of the band.\"But that ultimately\"this is a story of any young man who is struggling\". \n\nThe context for Jimmy's story, Townshend says, is\"the whole period in which we grew up, the whole post-war condition, all of the elements of life when the Mods and Rockers were meeting on the beaches down in Brighton\"-  a life which produced what he calls\"those kind of strange tensions in the young\". \n\nSinger Roger Daltrey says the tensions are still there. Asked about the summer riots in England two years ago, he says:\"That's the point about it; the adolescent dilemma is exactly the same as it ever was. In that sense it's timeless.\"\n\nThe other reason for Quadrophenia's longevity is of course the music itself. It's recognised as some of The Who's finest material, and is still feted by critics as one of the greatest rock albums of the era. \n\nThe album interweaves several musical themes, creating a mood which is by turns exuberant, defiant and wistful.  But while it's ambitious, it's far from inaccessible.\n\nTownshend says the band were at their peak as musicians when they recorded Quadrophenia, and the songs bear that out in their energy and immediacy. \n\nTownshend had written it\"shut away pretty much on my own\"- but in the recording studio, the other band members had a transforming influence. \n\n\"Roger's performances surprised me, because some of the songs that I'd intended to be quite bleak and poignant and painful and shy, like Love Reign O'er Me, Roger performed with immense passion, and yet still delivered the same kind of poignancy and vulnerability that I thought wouldn't be possible with such a bravura performance.\"\n\nBut over the years, The Who have struggled to bring the music to life on stage. Their first tour with Quadrophenia was hit by sound problems: the show depended heavily on backing tapes but Townshend says they didn't have enough technical support to make this work. \n\n In the 90s, the show used a narrator, which Daltrey believes put a distance between the audience and the music. \n\nThis time, The Who clearly believe they've managed to connect with their audience. At Daltrey's instigation, the narrator was dropped: he says:\"I made the audience Jimmy basically.\" The result has delighted both men. \n\nTownshend says:\"I've always said that what makes a great rock band is that it leaves space for the listeners to insert themselves into the story.  That's happening in this show,\n\n\"I'm very aware that when I'm performing to the audience, they're getting something from it that I'm not giving them.\"\n\nThe Who's show also pays a poignant tribute to the two band members who died: drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle.  \n\nEach briefly dominates the concert, appearing on screen in archive video clips which are integrated with the live performance. \n\nMoon is seen performing Bell Boy, the song in which the swaggering Mod idolised by Jimmy is brought down to size: shamefully revealed as a lowly hotel porter. \n\nDaltrey says:\"You really get something coming from Moon that I think most people overlook, because people tend to think he was this madman, this clown, all the time. But when you see him singing Bell Boy, there's this joy in his eyes but there's also the pathos of the song, and it's incredibly emotional to watch.\"\n\n Entwistle's playing is showcased during 5:15 in a virtuoso bass solo which Townshend describes as\"astonishing playing, and ridiculous playing as well. I've had a few bass players say to me'John Entwistle. What?' - they just don't understand what he did\". \n\nDaltrey and Townshend both talk with gratitude about their own lives now. \n\nTownshend says:\"I can't imagine being luckier than to get to this place in our lives when we're both pushing 70 and we've got this great music - and we also feel very lucky to be friends.\"\n\nDaltrey says simply: \"I've always said about music: you don't give it up, it gives you up, it leaves you.\"\n\nFor The Who, that moment still looks some distance away. \n\nThe Who on Quadrophenia, presented by David Willis, can be seen on the BBC News Channel this weekend, on Saturday 15 June at 00:30 and 15:30; Sunday 16 June at 10:30 and 20:30 and on Monday 17 June at 01:30. All times are BST.\nTL;DR: The Who are back on stage in the UK touring a full-length performance of their classic '70s album Quadrophenia. Its story belongs to a very brief moment in history: the Bank Holiday riots between rival gangs of Mods and Rockers in 1964.  Band members Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey tell the BBC News Channel why Quadrophenia has had such lasting appeal.\n\nArticle: The proportion for Wales (26%) is still worse than the worst region for child obesity in England (24%).\n\nA total of 32.4% of four and five-year-olds are overweight or obese on Anglesey. Merthyr (16.4%) is still top for obesity.\n\nMore than 30,000 children were weighed for the annual survey.\n\nThe study found the figure for Wales compared to 23% in England.\n\nThe gap between the most and least deprived areas is narrowing but Public Health Wales (PHW) admitted there was still\"much to do\".\n\nMerthyr Tydfil (32%) still had the second highest proportion of overweight or obese four and five year-olds, while Cardiff had one of the lowest, with 22.6%.\n\nThe report compared for the first time problems in rural and urban areas but found little difference.\n\nA pilot study of children in the Cwm Taf health board area found that more than a fifth of healthy four and five-year-olds went on to become overweight or obese by the time they were aged eight or nine.\n\nIt also found 82.5% of children classed as obese at that age were still the same as they got older.\n\nDr Julie Bishop, director of health improvement for PHW, said healthy lifestyles for pre-school children should be promoted across Wales.\n\n\"There are no specific figures, but certainly a trend we're concerned about is the relationship between the amount of screen time - on tablets, phones, game and computers - and obesity,\"she said.\n\n\"We need to see children out playing more and we know there are always parents concerns about safety but they need to be running around more. Projects run by the likes of Communities First and mother and toddler groups can be supportive in helping parents.\"\n\nChief medical officer for Wales, Dr Ruth Hussey, said it was good to see obesity levels had levelled off, but there was still much to do and young people were eating too much sugar.  \n\n\"The NHS alone cannot tackle childhood obesity,\"she said.\"There is much that parents can do to ensure their children have the best possible start in life.\n\n\"Research suggests that breastfeeding is linked to a reduced risk of obesity in children, and parents can access information and support on this from health visitors.\"\n\nThe latest figures for Scotland for 2013 found 26.5% of two to six-year-old children were at risk of being overweight or obese.\nTL;DR: Anglesey has overtaken Merthyr Tydfil as the area with the highest proportion of overweight or obese children, according to Public Health Wales.\n\nArticle: PC Jonny Wall, of Avon and Somerset Police, was instead handed a final written warning over his conduct while trying to help the\"heartbroken\"woman.\n\nChair of a misconduct panel Anna Vigars said:\"We're completely satisfied there was never any intention to seek to build a sexual relationship.\"\n\nShe said the warning was to restore public confidence in the force.\n\nDuring the hearing at police HQ in Portishead, Ms Vigars said the officer, who was based in Emersons Green,\"wrongly saw himself as someone who could solve her problems\".\n\n\"He is someone of huge empathy and compassion. He is able to defuse situations with warmth and humanity. \n\n\"We have no doubt that's what he intended to do.\"\n\n'Impart wisdom'\n\nPanel members heard the officer met Miss A and began lengthy conversations by text and Instagram, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\n\nInstead of helping her, he ended up as a go-between her and her former partner, Mr B who had accused her of harassment.\n\nMs Vigars said the officer should have known his messages were inappropriate and risked discrediting the police force. \n\nHis actions also embedded Miss A's sense of being a victim, the panel chair said.\n\nExplaining himself, PC Wall said:\"This chap [Mr B] had promised her the world. They'd had a fantastic 10 days and he just ended it without reason. I could relate to it. I felt sorry for her. \n\n\"I thought if I could impart some wisdom it could only be a good thing. \n\n\"I joined the police service to help people.\"\n\nDefending, Ramin Parkooh, said:\"There's no lack of integrity - just bad judgment with good intentions.\"\n\nClaims that PC Wall's failure to report concerns for her welfare for several days were a\"serious dereliction of duty\"were dismissed by the panel.\nTL;DR: A police officer has been cleared of seeking a sexual relationship with a vulnerable woman.\n\nArticle: By James WilliamsBBC Wales Brexit correspondent\n\nBut Julian Braithwaite, UK ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said his team could\"accommodate\"changes if the UK left without a trade deal.\n\nEconomy Secretary Ken Skates travelled to the body's Geneva headquarters to seek assurances on Welsh interests.\n\nMr Skates said the implications of a\"no deal\"scenario were not\"pretty\".\n\nHe highlighted steel, technology and energy as key priorities for Wales in trade negotiations. \n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK must prepare for\"every eventuality\", including not reaching a trade deal with Brussels. \n\nWhile the UK remains a member of the European Union, tariffs are not currently charged on goods and services exported from Wales and the UK to other EU nations.\n\nIf no deal was reached during the Brexit negotiations, then the UK and EU would operate a trading relationship under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\n\nUnder those rules, the EU would have to impose tariffs on goods and services from the UK at the same rate it charges to other countries - between 2-3% on many industrial products, 10% on cars, and between 20-40% on some agricultural products.\n\nMr Braithwaite, UK Ambassador to the WTO, said he thought there would be\"a lot of interest on both sides of the Channel\"to maintain tariff-free trade between the UK and the EU.\n\n\"What we're doing here at the moment assumes that that would be the outcome,\"he told BBC Wales. \n\n\"If we needed to accommodate EU27 trade into the UK without a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU we would be able to do that as well,\"he added.\n\nDespite being a founding member of the WTO in 1995, the UK's trading commitments to other members have, to date, been done as part of the EU.\n\nIn order to minimise disruption, the UK intends to replicate the EU's trading commitments with countries outside the Union, which includes the imposition of tariffs on goods and services as well as the imposition of quotas on how much of a product can be imported to the UK.\n\nSetting import quotas, according to Mr Braithwaite,\"is perhaps the most sensitive issue in this transition\".\n\nAfter meeting the ambassador, Mr Skates visited Alan Wolff, deputy director-general of the WTO. \n\nThe economy secretary aimed to use the visit to ensure Wales' interests were\"fairly represented\"at the WTO during the Brexit process.\n\nHe repeated the Welsh Government's opposition to a\"no deal\"Brexit.\n\n\"We've been working with academics, we've been working in particular with Cardiff Business School, looking at the implications of a'no deal' scenario and it's not very pretty,\"Mr Skates said.\n\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones has previously claimed that farming in Wales would\"fall off the edge of the cliff\"if the UK had to rely on WTO rules after Brexit.\n\nBut Brexit-supporting economists, including Prof Patrick Minford of Cardiff University, have argued that the UK should unilaterally scrap all tariffs on goods and services from the EU and other nations in a bid to bring down all barriers to trade.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK government will\"intensify\"its engagement with the Welsh and other devolved governments over Brexit in the coming months.\n\nThe cabinet was told the\"successful implementation of Brexit\"would require work on the part of both businesses and devolved administrations.\nTL;DR: A Welsh minister has been told UK trade officials are working on the assumption there will be no tariffs with the EU after Brexit.\n\nArticle: Dean Stansby, 41, died in hospital after he was stabbed in the abdomen in Ancaster Road, Ipswich, on 8 February. \n\nJason Ruby, 44, of Risby Close, Ipswich, and Tecwyn Parker, 47, of Downside Close, Ipswich, pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy to murder at Ipswich Crown Court.\n\nA third man, Yusuf Ahmed, 26, from east London, denied two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. \n\nThey are due to appear at the same court on 23 January.\n\nDaniel Kaganda, 23, of The Grange, East Finchley, London, pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy to murder at a hearing in November. \n\nAmiadul Islam, 25, of Caistor Park Road, Newham, London, denies conspiracy to murder.\nTL;DR: Two men have denied killing a man who was stabbed in a street.\n\nArticle: Tom Webb, 22, from Alvaston, died in hospital after being attacked in St Peter's Street on 19 January. \n\nThe 16-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was remanded in custody after pleading not guilty to the murder of Mr Webb.\n\nA total of 13 people have been arrested and bailed in connection with the murder, Derbyshire Police said.\n\nUpdates on this story and more from Derbyshire\n\nTwo men -

such as bariatric and vascular surgery - offering treatments locally in Surrey that previously would only have been provided in the larger London hospitals,\"he said.\n\nA list of possible options for St Helier and Sutton Hospitals is expected by the end of the summer.\n\nLast month a Scoring Panel of 60 local people, managers and GPs decided that St Helier should lose its A&E and maternity departments, but have a planned centre for elective surgery.\n\nUnder the plan, services would be transferred to Croydon and Kingston Hospitals.\n\nBut Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for Sutton and Cheam has said the plans\"lack reality\"and should not go ahead.\nTL;DR: Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust has been confirmed as the preferred partner for Epsom Hospital.\n\nArticle: Speaking in Parliament, Simon Danczuk also asked why the case was dropped, against advice, by prosecutors.\n\nAn inquiry must\"get to the bottom of what several former police officers are now referring to as a cover up\", he said.\n\nSir Cyril's brother Norman said the late MP had denied the allegations.\n\nSeveral former residents of a Rochdale boys' hostel, including current Rossendale councillor Alan Neal, have claimed they were indecently assaulted by the Liberal MP, who died in 2010.\n\nMr Danczuk said files from a Lancashire Police investigation in the 1960s, which the force had been unable to find, had now been uncovered by the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nHe asked:\"Can the home secretary now look at whether it's true the director of public prosecutions at the time received a second opinion recommending Smith be prosecuted, and why he concluded it was not in the public interest?\n\nHe also asked for an inquiry into\"what role, if any, security services played\".\n\nCrime Prevention Minister Jeremy Browne said members of the public should report claims to the police, and go to the Independent Police Complaints Commission with any concerns over the role of police.\n\nLib Dem Mr Browne added:\"Obviously we would expect those authorities to act on the information provided to them.\"\nTL;DR: Rochdale's MP has called for an inquiry into the role of MI5 in a potential \"cover-up\" of alleged abuse by former MP Cyril Smith in the 1960s.\n\nArticle: The company said that about 700 of its\"partners\"in the US had been affected by the mistake.\n\nExposed data included social security numbers, photos of driver licences, tax forms and other details, according to news site Motherboard, which first reported the issue.\n\nThe error was discovered by the drivers themselves.\n\n\"Whoah -

Human Rights Watch called for his resignation. \n\nUp to two million Cambodians are thought to have died - from starvation, overwork or execution - during the four years of Khmer Rouge rule.  \n\nThe genocide tribunal was established to bring the regime's leaders to justice. But so far only one case - against former Khmer Rouge prison chief Duch - has been successfully concluded. \n\nFour top leaders including Pol Pot's deputy, Nuon Chea, are due to go on trial in the coming months. \n\n'No hope'\n\nIt is the handling of the third and fourth cases - involving five people alleged to have been senior Khmer Rouge commanders - that has caused the current row.\n\nMr Blunk and his Cambodian counterpart You Bunleng sparked concern among rights groups in April after they closed their investigation into the third case. \n\nLast week, Human Rights Watch called for their resignation, saying they had\"failed to conduct genuine, impartial and effective investigations\".\n\nThe group said that the tribunal had been\"subject to frequent politically motivated interference\"from the ruling party, many of whom were former Khmer Rouge leaders. \n\nPrime Minister Hun Sen - at one point a mid-ranking Khmer Rouge commander - as well as his information minister and foreign minister have all separately made it clear in recent months that they do not want further prosecutions after the second trial has concluded.\n\nMr Blunk's resignation statement came through the court. \n\nIt said that while he was not influenced by political statements,\"his ability to withstand such pressure by government officials to perform his duties independently, could always be called in doubt, and this would also call in doubt the integrity of the whole proceedings\"of the two new cases.\n\nJudge Blunk has been a controversial figure since he took over from French judge Marcel Lemonde to investigate cases three and four, the BBC's Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh says.\n\nMany of his own international staff have been so dismayed by the way the crimes were being investigated that they quit in protest. One called Mr Blunk's office\"dysfunctional\", our correspondent says.\nTL;DR: The German judge at Cambodia's UN-backed genocide tribunal says he is resigning over government statements opposing any further prosecutions.\n\nArticle: By Anthony ReubenBBC Reality Check\n\nThe government is confusing GDP per household with household income.\n\nGDP per household is what you get when you add up everything produced in the economy in a year and divide it by the number of households. GDP per household does have an impact on household income, but not on a pound-for-pound basis - so you would expect it to fall by somewhat less than \u00a34,300.\n\nIf you think about it, this must be the case. GDP is currently about \u00a31.8tn a year - if you divide that by 27 million households you get \u00a366,666. But average household income is about \u00a344,000. They are clearly not the same thing.\n\nAnother thing to stress is that the Treasury is not saying that the economy would be this much per household worse off than they are now in 2030. It is saying that the economy would be 6% smaller in 2030 if the UK left the EU than it would be if it stayed in.\n\nBut the question is, how much do we believe in this sort of study at all. Reality Check has discussed in the past the problems with economic modelling.\n\nIf you don't want to be influenced by economic modelling then look away now, after all, it is very difficult to predict anything in 15 years.\n\nIf you are still reading, the thing to take away from this morning's events is this: ignore the headline figures - the Treasury thinks that leaving the EU would be bad for the UK economy, reducing its output by a considerable amount.\n\nIf what you care about is economic modelling, then this is a perfectly respectable piece of modelling, following broadly similar methodology to the one from the Centre for Economic Performance, although headlining the figure taking into account dynamic effects rather than static ones (dynamic models include changes that happen over time such as trade increasing competition or efficiency).\n\nThis is not hugely surprising - economic models tend to assume that free trade and economic cooperation are a good thing.\n\nLooking into the detail, it is a bit odd that throughout the analysis the Treasury has used ONS forecasts for what will happen to population by 2030, without considering what difference leaving the EU would make. Given that one of the key points of leaving the EU is supposed to be to tighten up the UK's borders, it seems a mistake not to take into account that effect. It would be expected to reduce the supply of workers, although the Treasury model predicts a rise in unemployment following an exit from the UK, so there would also be less demand. The effect is discussed in more detail here. \n\nThere has also been criticism of the decision to base part of the calculation on the number of households today rather than a forecast for the number of households in 2030, which is expected to be considerably higher.\n\nThe Treasury explained that the reason this was done was to provide an illustration of what 6% lower GDP would look like to households today. So they took 2015 GDP in 2015 prices and divided by the number of households in 2015. Had they decided to use forecasts for 2030, the number of households would have been higher, but so would the level of GDP.\n\nOne useful thing from this Treasury report is that it helps put into context the significance of the UK's contribution to the EU Budget. The Treasury says that the 6% of GDP in 2030 would cut tax receipts by \u00a336bn, dwarfing the contributions to the EU. Indeed, the Treasury has reached the \u00a336bn figure after subtracting the UK's \u00a37bn a year average net contribution.\n\nReality Check verdict: The precise figure is questionable and probably not particularly helpful. If you want to be influenced by economic modelling, the useful thing to take away is that the Treasury thinks leaving the EU would be bad for the economy, by an amount that would dwarf the savings from not having to contribute to the EU Budget.\n\nREAD MORE: The facts behind claims in the EU debate\nTL;DR: The poster at George Osborne's event this morning made a bold claim -

a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy and some other countries have backed the quota proposal, but a majority of EU governments would have to agree for it to become law.\n\nAs things stand, the UK could decide to opt in to the scheme, but could not be compelled to join, as it has the power to opt out of justice and home affairs policies set by the EU - and asylum decisions are included in that opt-out.\n\nThe Home Office has instead urged the EU to focus on combating people traffickers.\nTL;DR: A British warship has rescued hundreds of migrants from the Mediterranean, the Ministry of Defence has said.\n\nArticle: West Midlands Police said the man, suspected of stealing a Range Rover Sport, punched the officer to the ground as he tried to arrest him at 16:45 BST on Saturday in Birmingham.\n\nThe traffic officer was then run over, suffering serious head and pelvic injuries.\n\nA 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.\n\nThe officer was in Moorcroft Road, Moseley, tracing the Range Rover which had been stolen minutes earlier from a woman, police said.\n\n\"As he [the officer] moved in to arrest the man he was violently assaulted and punched to the ground -

The smell of so many decomposing bodies close up must be difficult to take.\n\nIn Vienna, Serbia and Macedonia have told the summit on migration that EU must come up with an action plan to respond to the influx of migrants into Europe.\n\nAustria has complained that the EU has failed to address the problem of people entering via the Western Balkans.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday's find\"reminds us to tackle the issue of migration with European spirit and find solutions\".\n\nA record number of 107,500 migrants crossed the EU's borders last month and on Wednesday police counted more than 3,000 crossing into Serbia.\n\nMany make their way north from Greece. The International Organization for Migration said on Thursday that an estimated 209,457 migrants had entered Greece between 1 January and 25 August this year, nearly five times the number that arrived in the whole of 2014.\n\nMeanwhile migrants are continuing to die as they try to reach Europe via the central Mediterranean route. The bodies of at least 51 people were found on Wednesday in the hold of a stricken ship off the coast of Libya.\n\nMigrants' perilous Western Balkan route to Germany\n\nWhy is EU struggling with

this month Mr Ford stepped aside as an elder at Second Donegore Presbyterian Church over his political support for gay marriage. \n\nHis position on the issue is to be examined by the church.  \n\nMr Ford said the language of the debate was important.\n\n\"I think it's not for majorities to tell minorities that feel discriminated against that they're not being discriminated against,\"he told the BBC's Sunday Sequence.\n\n\"I think you only have to look back at the history of this region in the 1950s and 60s to see the dangers of majorities telling minorities that discrimination isn't real.\"\n\nLast September, the Alliance Party voted in support of legislation to allow gay civil marriage in Northern Ireland. \n\nMr Ford voluntarily stepped aside as an elder in Second Donegore Presbyterian Church after some members of the congregation expressed concerns about his support for marriage equality laws.\n\n\"It appeared my political position was a focus for some limited dissent within the congregation,\"he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure how many members of the congregation did go to the minister. \n\n\"I know there were a small number who had a conversation with the minister and I've had conversations both, in the presbytery and in the session, before I voluntarily stepped aside, just to be very clear, currently from the active duties of the office, not from the office. \n\n\"I think that is very much an issue which is in the hands of the session of Second Donegore as to whether or when they might wish me to resume those duties.\"\n\nMr Ford told the programme it had been a\"difficult time for me and my family given the way the controversy has raged and given to some extent the way it's been handled in the media\".\n\nThe Alliance Party supports same sex marriage in Northern Ireland, while the Presbyterian church strongly opposes the move. \n\nMr Ford said his personal position on same sex marriage was the same as the party's position. \n\n\"I believe the state has a duty to provide services for citizens on an equal basis, and at the same time, the state has a duty to protect the rights of churches to define and practice their own beliefs,\"he said.\nTL;DR: The Alliance Party leader David Ford has compared the current debate over equal marriage legislation to the civil rights campaign 50 years ago in Northern Ireland.\n\nArticle: The Supreme Court was told\"huge numbers\"of cases were prosecuted based on information from such organisations.\n\nThe judges are being asked to consider whether prosecutions based on these operations breach human rights.\n\nThe case has been brought by Mark Sutherland who was caught by a group called Groom Resisters Scotland. \n\nIn 2018, Sutherland, 37, matched up on Grindr with someone who, when he communicated with them, claimed to be a 13-year-old boy.\n\nHe sent sexual messages and images to the person and they later arranged to meet at Partick Bus Station in Glasgow.\n\nIn reality, the person Sutherland was communicating with was not a child, but a\"decoy\"- a member of Groom Resisters Scotland. \n\nThe group confronted Sutherland at the arranged meeting, broadcasted the encounter on social media and handed the evidence to the police.\n\nHe was convicted in August 2018 of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child, and related offences, and jailed for two years. \n\nHe had previously been jailed for sending explicit pictures to a 12-year-old boy.\n\nSutherland argues that his right to a private life, enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, had been breached.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, his lawyer Gordon Jackson QC, said:\"The police are aware that there a number of hunter organisations operating in Scotland and the UK and evidence submitted from these organisations has led to a number of criminal investigations and convictions.\"\n\nThere is\"disquiet\"about the work of such groups, he said.\n\nMr Jackson argued that\"a huge number\"of cases were prosecuted on the basis of information from these organisations.\n\n\"What we have is tacit encouragement of these groups,\"he said.\n\n'No right'\n\nAlison di Rollo QC, Solicitor General for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland's prosecution service, which is opposing the appeal, argued that the criminal prosecution of sexual conduct between an adult and a child\"does not engage\"someone's rights to privacy.\n\n\"There is no right to respect for such behaviour in a democratic society,\"she said.\n\nMs di Rollo said it was clear the\"overriding duty\"of the police was\"to respond to any report of any identified person who may pose a sexual risk to children\".\n\nShe said there was guidance which set out\"the risks, the activities, the undesirability of the activities of these groups\"but regardless of the source of evidence, the usual high standards of investigation were required. \n\nShe also said members of paedophile hunter groups were themselves liable to criminal prosecution if they broke the law.  \n\nThe Supreme Court judges are expected to deliver their ruling at a later date.\n\nThe case before the Supreme Court justices is very important as the law surrounding the activities of\"paedophile hunters\"is currently unclear. \n\nYet according to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) almost half of online grooming cases result from the activities of vigilante groups.\n\nThe inspectorate said these groups are unregulated and untrained, and in its report in February 2020 said:\"A more robust proactive capability on the part of Police Scotland would reduce the opportunities for these groups to operate.\"\n\nAlthough Mark Sutherland was convicted by a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court, a later case in Dundee was thrown out because evidence gained by a vigilante group was ruled\"inadmissible.\"\n\nIn that case the sheriff said the means used to induce the accused, known only as PHP, into engaging in an exchange of messages amounted to\"fraud\".\n\nPHP's lawyers said the vigilantes' activities interfered with his rights under ECHR Article 8 and using their evidence in any trial would mean the court was acting\"incompatibly\"with those rights.\n\nThey also argued the use of information gathered covertly was unlawful under legislation designed to ensure the surveillance of a person was properly regulated.\n\nThose arguments were rejected by the sheriff, but he said by pretending falsely to be young children, the vigilantes had acted unlawfully.\n\nThe case at the Supreme Court is being watched carefully by England's Director of Public Prosecutions who has been granted\"intervener\"status. \n\nThe judgement, which will be issued later, will provide a definitive answer to the question of whether undercover vigilante activity is legal, and compatible with human rights, even of those who seek to abuse children.\nTL;DR: Police and prosecutors give \"tacit encouragement\" to so-called \"paedophile hunter\" groups, the UK's highest court has heard.\n\nArticle: Alun Cairns said compromise had been necessary to ensure an\"awfully good package\".\n\nThe MP told BBC Wales he did not like the so-called backstop option - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no hard border in Ireland if there is no EU trade deal.\n\nMr Cairns now expects MPs to back the deal when a Commons vote takes place.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May told listeners on BBC Radio 5 Live that the UK would not get a\"better deal\"if MPs rejected the draft withdrawal agreement.\n\n\"I don't like every element of this document because we've compromised, we have to, that's the nature of the discussions that have taken place over the past two years,\"Mr Cairns said in an interview with BBC Wales.\n\n\"But I look at the context... this is an awfully good package that will benefit the Welsh economy and the UK economy.\n\n\"I would prefer it if the backstop wasn't there... but we wouldn't have had the trade package if the backstop wasn't there.\n\n\"So I'm prepared to accept a trade package with the EU and accept the cost of the backstop.\"\n\nDespite widespread criticism of the Brexit deal from all parties, Mr Cairns said he expected a majority of MPs to vote in favour of the withdrawal agreement in the Commons.\n\nHe believes Parliament will agree that the deal is better than the alternative options of leaving the EU without a deal, or remaining in the EU. \n\n\"When they see what this deal does then I think people will take this,\"he said.\n\nAsked if he was simply making an argument for the least worst option, Mr Cairns replied:\"No, this is a deal that would command the majority of support from the public.\"\n\nMr Cairns praised the prime minister's\"resilience and determination to get a deal that works for every part of the country as well as bringing the country together\".\n\n\"The reality is if the prime minister had delivered an outcome that served the hardline brexiteers or that served those remainers that want to ignore the outcome of the referendum, the country wouldn't have come together,\"he added.\n\n\"I think everyone has got to admire the deal that's come forward, what it delivers, that there's a significant amount in this for everyone and this is why I think the country will get behind the prime minister.\"\nTL;DR: The Secretary of State for Wales has admitted he had reservations with the UK government's Brexit deal.\n\nArticle: \"The world has lost a gifted author\". The words of Helen Bailey's brother John were repeated by the judge at St Albans Crown Court when he sentenced Ian Stewart to 34 years in prison.\n\nHer skills as a writer had shone through when she started blogging following the death of her husband John Sinfield in 2011, getting to know people from across the country as she chronicled her life as a widow.\n\nHere, some of those people share their memories of her:\n\n'Her words resonated'\n\nLaraine Mason met Ms Bailey online following the death of John Sinfield and Ms Mason's own husband.\n\n\"We were all part of this community of bereaved people, and she was welcomed into it, but it soon became apparent she brought something else to the table - her ability as a writer,\"Ms Mason recalled.\"She put into words what most of us thought but couldn't articulate. It resonated. It was written in a language people could understand.\n\n\"But when I talked to Helen, there was more to our conversations than the commonality of bereavement. At her memorial service, people from the widowed community turned up. This was somebody who touched people on another level.\"\n\n'Lucky to have met her'\n\nBBC Radio 4 presenter Jane Garvey met Ms Bailey in October 2015 while the author was promoting her book.\n\n\"Some people I've interviewed stick in my mind; some don't,\"she said.\"Helen Bailey didn't just stick in my mind, she struck a chord with the audience and generated a huge response when she appeared on Woman's Hour. I'd read her book, When Bad Things Happen In Good Bikinis, and when I met Helen she was exactly the sort of person I'd hoped she would be.\n\n\"I was asked to read an excerpt from one of her books at her memorial service in November, and after talking to her friends and family I realised what a strong partnership she'd had with her husband John Sinfield. \n\n\"Her description in her book of the day he died is a brilliant piece of writing. She deserves to be remembered as more than a murder victim - she was a great writer and an astute businesswoman, as well as being so funny and honest about herself. I feel lucky to have met her.\"\n\nLaura Richards, a domestic violence campaigner and founder of the charity Paladin, a stalking advocacy service, echoed the presenter's view:\n\nMs Bailey was a member of WAY (Widowed and Young), a charity for men and women under the age of 50 whose partners have died.\n\nThe charity posted this message on Facebook following Ian Stewart's conviction for murder:\n\n'Boris saw her through some dark times'\n\nAnother friend of Ms Bailey, Emily Thomas, said she would remember the writer as\"effervescent - full of life, incredibly talented, warm, funny, vivacious. I'll remember her as somebody who took every opportunity to love life despite the tragedy she went though when her husband John died in 2011. She was an incredibly life-affirming person.\n\n\"I think with bereavement, it's not a linear thing, and I think she certainly came out of a period of great darkness into another period of her life with more positivity. But it takes a long time to get over that kind of loss. I think she grasped any opportunity to feel good about life.\n\n\"Boris the Dachshund saw her through some really dark times. She adored him. He was her trusted little companion for a long time, and a dog she had with her husband. He meant a huge amount to her. He was the love of her life.\"\n\nBook sales soar\n\nOnline sales of Helen Bailey's books have jumped considerably in light of the end of the trial, with her first book for adults -\"When Bad Things Happen in Good Bikinis\"- seeing a 17,000% increase in sales on Amazon in the last 24 hours.\n\nBefore its publication in 2015, Ms Bailey had written more than 20 other books for children and young adults, including the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport series.\n\nIn the weeks before her death, Ms Bailey and Stewart - who had experience as a web designer - were working on a new blog site called\"And Beyond: One Life Live It\".\n\nUnder the headings Fashion, Dogs, Flowers, Food and Life, test posts still appear, with one reading:\"This is just a test post to see how things work on this blog that my super duper man has organised for me.\"\n\nThere are also pictures of her beloved Boris, who is seen next to a copy of her book - the same book which is now climbing the sales charts, introducing new readers to her writing and ensuring her legacy will not be forgotten.\nTL;DR: Helen Bailey - author, widow, fianc\u00e9e, dog owner, football fan - was found dead in July 2016. The man she loved, Ian Stewart, drugged and suffocated her before throwing her body into a cesspit. But those who knew and loved her do not want her to be remembered for how she died.\n\nArticle: Peter Shields, of Tynwald Street in Douglas, admitted unlawfully leaving his home address to visit the Sea Terminal and Graih drop-in centre.\n\nUnder Manx Covid-19 regulations, everybody returning to the island must self-isolate for a mandatory period.\n\nShields, 64, was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for four weeks.\n\nThe court heard Shields had travelled from Douglas to Liverpool on the Manannan ferry on Friday afternoon.\n\nHe returned to the island from Heysham, Lancashire on the overnight Ben-My-Chree crossing.\n\nOn arrival at Douglas port, Shields had not completed the documentation needed to enter the island.\n\nHe said he\"understood\"an explanation of the self-isolation rules given to him by port staff.\n\n'Vulnerable people'\n\nAt about 18:15 BST he returned to the Sea Terminal to book another ferry ticket to Liverpool and told staff he had arrived back on the island that morning.\n\nShields, who is unemployed, was then reported to police.\n\nOfficers visited his home to find him not there and, when they contacted him by telephone, he said he was at Graih, on Broadway in Douglas,\"having dinner\".\n\nHe was arrested at the drop-in centre and, when questioned, he admitted he\"broke the rules\".\n\nHigh Bailiff Jayne Hughes said it was a\"blatant\"breach of the Covid-19 rules, which could have put\"vulnerable people\"at risk.\n\nHe was sentenced to a further two weeks, to run consecutively, after admitting three charges of stealing food and soft drinks from a petrol station in Peel in July.\n\nMrs Hughes also ordered that a six-month probation order, put in place in June, should continue.\n\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

But talks on the outline of a future trade relationship have barely begun. \n\nAnd if the Withdrawal Agreement is not finalised soon, time to pass the necessary legislation to ratify and implement it will be in short supply.\n\nImplementation\n\nWhen it comes to\"no-deal\"plans, ministers insist they are\"far advanced\"and the IFG agrees that progress has been made. But businesses also need to be ready for dramatic change and the IFG says government guidance to business and consumers on how to prepare has come too late. The report says other European governments, such as the Irish and Dutch, published their\"no-deal\"guidance\"much earlier\".\n\nThe report uses a traffic light system to assess overall progress. \n\nIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal in March 2019, only one policy area - EU programmes and funds - is coloured green, suggesting that the government will be ready.\n\nNine other broad policy areas - including borders, citizens and migration, agriculture, fisheries and food, health, transport, tax and data and services - are given a red light, suggesting the government won't be able to avoid\"major negative impacts\"of no deal next year.\n\nEven if a deal is reached, which is what the government wants, implementing Brexit in the 21-month transition period - which would, among other things, mean agreeing and ratifying a future trade deal - looks\"completely unfeasible\", according to the report.\n\nFor example, the IFG says that more than 140,000 businesses would need to be ready for changes at UK borders, and new customs systems would not be ready in time. \n\nIt notes that the government is hiring 9,000 extra staff and spending \u00a32bn on Brexit preparations by March 2019, with more money allocated for 2019-20; but it warns that\"Brexit is the biggest implementation challenge government has faced in generations\".\n\nTo give a sense of scale, it has compared the Brexit transition with other major UK government projects over the last few years.\n\nThe automatic pension enrolment programme, and preparations for the London Olympics, both took more than a decade to prepare and implement; digitising tax took five years.  \n\nImplementing Brexit in 21 months will, by comparison, be extremely tight.\n\nThe IFG report also compares the length of the transition period (21 months) with the time taken to negotiate and fully implement recent free trade agreements. The EU-Canada free trade deal that we hear so much about has taken more than seven years so far. The EU-South Korea deal took nine years. \n\nIn other words, even if\"no deal\"on a withdrawal agreement is avoided in March 2019, the government will still be facing the prospect of\"no deal\"on a comprehensive trade agreement in December 2020, at the end of the transition period.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe clock is ticking in Parliament too.\n\nIf a deal on a Withdrawal Agreement is reached this autumn, possibly in mid-November, there would only be about 70 sitting days in Parliament before Brexit is due to happen. \n\nIn the past, says the IFG, significant treaty change has taken about 40 days to get through Parliament. \n\nPart of a potential 70-day period would have to be devoted to other issues such as debating the Budget and passing a finance bill. \n\nThe government will also need to win a\"meaningful vote\"on its deal with the EU in the House of Commons, before trying to pass legislation giving the Withdrawal Agreement effect in UK law.\n\nAnd while a number of votes may be tight, so too will be the number of days. The House of Commons could choose to sit more often on a Friday to add extra days, but there will not be much room for manoeuvre. \n\nIn the past 18 months, the IFG says there have been some big achievements and the government has passed six of the 13 Brexit bills currently announced. But there are now only six months to go.  \n\nThe government also needs to pass about 800 pieces of secondary legislation (known as statutory instruments) to ensure that UK law actually works properly on the day the UK leaves the EU. \n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union says its planning demonstrates that it can be done, but\"there is a lot of work to do in order to manage it\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser\n\nYour guide to Brexit jargon\n\nAn additional challenge, the IFG points out, is that\"until a full Withdrawal Agreement is locked down in legal text\", government preparations for no deal have to continue. \n\nIn the event of no deal, of course, Parliament will have to scramble to pass all sorts of legislation for sudden change in a whole host of policy areas. \n\n\"There is a real risk,\"the IFG argues,\"that this will not be in place, and the UK will face a legal hiatus.\"\n\nThe risks are reflected in the traffic lights: if there is a deal they are green for most legislation, except for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which would still need to be passed and is flashing amber.\n\nWith no deal, again there is some green, indicating that plans are already in place. But there are plenty of pieces of legislation coloured amber, suggesting uncertainty, and on the future rights of citizens in the event of no deal, the lights remain red.  \n\nNegotiation\n\nAn awful lot depends on the next few weeks - as negotiations with the EU on a Withdrawal Agreement, the terms on which the UK will leave, reach their final phase.\n\nThe two sides also need to agree a political declaration on the future relationship - and persuade the UK and European parliaments to accept it all.\n\nThe IFG's negotiation traffic lights have a lot in green, including a financial settlement, citizens, and agreement in principle on the transition period. Officials say the deal is at least 80% done. \n\n\"We make progress every week and a deal is within our sights,\"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told the House of Commons this month. \n\nBut the IFG also designates some amber issues - including governance (the role of the European Court of Justice), and the status of Gibraltar; while the toughest part of all - avoiding a hard border in Ireland - is still flashing red.\n\nThe other red light in this section refers to the fraught process of ratification in the UK Parliament, while the government also needs to renegotiate hundreds of agreements with other countries - on trade and other issues - to replace those it has been part of as an EU member. \n\nBrexit, the IFG concludes, is likely to lead to\"unprecedented levels of change across huge swathes of policy simultaneously\".\n\nThat is one of the reasons why many people are campaigning for a People's Vote or second referendum, once the details of any deal to leave are revealed.  \n\nThat, of course, is not government policy. \n\nBut with six months to go, the whole process remains highly uncertain. \n\nWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Mustafa Alani of the Dubai-based Gulf Research Centre said he was\"more a preacher than a commander\".\n\n'Major attacks'\n\nUS officials were hopeful that social media reports that Fadhli was among those killed in the recent missile strikes were true, but cautioned that the group would remain a threat.\n\n\"His loss would be significant, but as we've seen before, any decapitation is only a short-term gain. The hydra will grow another head,\"Congressman Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told the New York Times. \n\nClassified US intelligence assessments said the Khorasan Group was collaborating with the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to test ways to get explosives past airport security, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAQAP's Saudi bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, is believed to have built the device that Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab concealed in his underwear and tried to detonate in an aircraft over Detroit in 2009.\n\nUS officials say the intelligence that Asiri might be helping the Khorasan Group was the reason the Transportation Security Administration decided in July to ban uncharged mobile phones and laptops from flights to the US originating in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBy September, intelligence reports indicated that the Khorasan Group was\"in the final stages of plans to execute major attacks\", Pentagon spokesman Lt-Gen William Mayville said. \n\nAlthough it was not clear when, where or how the militants intended to strike, one US report said they were planning to build a bomb that would be difficult to detect by lacing non-metallic objects like toothpaste tubes and clothes with explosives.\n\nThe US Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, told a recent intelligence gathering that\"in terms of threat to the homeland, Khorasan may pose as much of a danger as the Islamic State\".\n\nMr Holder said strikes on the Khorasan Group would\"probably continue until we are at a stage where we think we have degraded their ability to get at our allies or to the homeland\".\nTL;DR: Shortly before the United States and its Arab allies launched air strikes on Islamic State (IS) positions across Syria on Tuesday, cruise missiles launched from US warships in the Gulf and Red Sea struck two areas west of the city of Aleppo.\n\nArticle: Ashton Gate, home of Bristol City FC and the Bristol Bears rugby team, will become the regional vaccination centre for the city and surrounding area.\n\nIt is predicted as many 110,000 people per week could be be vaccinated there, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\n\nRegulators have yet to approve a vaccine.\n\nIf one is approved the Ashton Gate programme would prioritise people over 50, and frontline health workers.\n\nThe plan was in a report presented to University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Trust (UHBW) board on Friday.\n\nRobert Woolley, chief executive of UHBW, which runs the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol Children's Hospital and Weston General, told board members preparations were\"moving very fast.\"\n\n\"It [vaccine approval] is subject to Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority approval but if that is fast tracked as we expect then we are gearing up to be able to start vaccinating staff and any other priorities that are advised to us nationally in December.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Ashton Gate would be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week and the programme would be overseen by North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT).\n\nPatients from Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire would be vaccinated at the stadium.\n\nJenny Bowker, head of primary care development for the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG, said that everyone over 50 and other high-risk groups would be seen first, with over-80s and care home residents and staff at the front of the queue.\n\nAddressing South Gloucestershire Council's Health Scrutiny Committee on 25 November, she said GPs should be ready\"within weeks\"to take part in vaccinations, although it was not certain which vaccine would be available first.\nTL;DR: Bristol's biggest sports stadium has been earmarked as a site for mass coronavirus vaccinations.\n\nArticle: Industrial action on Thursday and Friday has been called off for negotiations to resume.\n\nRMT members began a five-day walk out on Monday but Southern said it was encouraged its offer of talks had been accepted.\n\nUnion chief Mick Cash said he had contacted Southern with a way forward.\n\nA spokesman for Southern said:\"For our passengers' sake, we truly hope these talks will be productive and bring this long-running dispute to an end.\"\n\n'Progress made'\n\nThe RMT is fighting plans by Southern owner Govia Thameslink (GTR) to turn conductors into\"on-board supervisors\"from 21 August, with drivers taking over responsibility for opening and closing carriage doors.\n\nProfile of Mick Cash\n\nThe rail operator said the strike timetable - which is running 60% of normal services - would run on Thursday.\n\n\"Regrettably, this means tomorrow's service will be based upon the present strike timetable but we will do our very best to add services in and extend the hours of operation wherever possible,\"a spokesman said.\n\nThe company said it planned to revert to the revised timetable that had been operating before the strike on Friday.\n\nThe revised timetable was brought in last month to cope with ongoing disruption. It saw 341 trains axed per day from the 2,242 weekday services Southern had provided.\n\nMr Cash said in a message to members he had heard from Acas that Southern would enter into negotiations\"without any preconditions\".\n\nHe said:\"The National Executive Committee (NEC) has had time to consider this matter and have acknowledged that some progress is being made.\n\n\"As the company have now agreed to meet with our union officials without the caveat of any preconditions, the NEC has therefore instructed me to inform you and your colleagues that the strike action has now been suspended with immediate effect until further notice.\"\n\nMr Cash told members they were instructed to return to work for all shifts starting from 22:00 BST on Wednesday.\n\nTransport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was\"good news for passengers\".\n\nHe said:\"It's important now to leave the union and the train operator to undertake these necessary talks.  I hope they reach a positive conclusion as quickly as possible.\"\n\nPassengers have joined a protest march from London's Victoria station to the Department for Transport (DfT) in central London.\n\nSummer Dean, from Brighton, spokeswoman for the Association of British Commuters said:\"We are directing our attentions towards the DfT.\n\n\"Obviously we know they are playing a large role in the relationship and situation that is going on here.\n\n\"We've now recognised that the DfT needs to play a bigger role. So we're here to ask for fare freezes, we're here to ask for them to meet with us and other passengers and the companies, and for meaningful compensation.\"\n\nThe Campaign for Better Transport and the Association of British Commuters were presenting a 6ft-high letter to rail minister Paul Maynard calling on him to attend a\"passenger assembly\"to answer questions and arrange better compensation for customers affected by the dispute.\nTL;DR: A strike on the Southern rail network has been suspended to allow fresh talks in the row over the role of conductors, Acas said.\n\nArticle: The Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port, which employs about 1,500, shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March.\n\nThe safety measures include temperature checks and changes in shift patterns.\n\nVice-president Yann Vincent said the\"strengthened health procedures\"would give staff\"a high level of protection\".\n\nHe added that since the beginning of the pandemic, the firm's priority had been to\"protect its employees and preserve the company's long-term future\".\n\nLockdown measures saw the group shut its European manufacturing plants in March.\n\nIts Luton plant restarted production in May with some staff temporarily transferring from the Merseyside site.\n\nThe Ellesmere Port plant, which will reopen on 17 August, produced around 62,000 Astra cars in 2019.\n\nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Eurotunnel definitely need to up their communications on social media and on the ground.\"\n\nHe added:\"Cars with roof racks have an extra delay as they can't get on double-decker carriages, so go with the high vehicles.\"\n\nThe Port of Dover reported\"lots of traffic\"heading towards the port, with delays of 45 minutes for passengers going through passport control at ferry terminals. \n\nP&O asked passengers to allow an extra 90 minutes to clear all security checks at Dover and is advising passengers to book in advance. \n\nDFDS also warned passengers of delays of up to two hours to reach the port. \n\nBoth ferry companies say delayed passengers will be accommodated on the first available ship. \n\n\"The prolonged and unprecedented temperatures in the south east of England are affecting the air conditioning on board our shuttles,\"Eurotunnel said on its website.\n\n\"Due to the high level of traffic booked, we are currently unable to check in any customers arriving more than two hours before their booked crossing time. \n\n\"We strongly recommend that you stock up with water and take a comfort break prior to arriving at our Folkestone Terminal.\"\nTL;DR: Eurotunnel passengers faced a third day of disruption after the heat caused air conditioning problems on cross-Channel trains.\n\nArticle: By Winnie  AgbonlahorBBC News, London\n\nThey said the Department for Education did not take punitive steps against the head at St Olave's school in south-east London because it was partly to blame.\n\nThe DfE's increasingly stringent league table criteria forces schools into\"dubious\"policies, campaigners said.\n\nThe DfE said it wrote to schools to say such expulsions were illegal last year.\n\nThe practice, found to be illegal in an independent inquiry commissioned by Bromley Council, was introduced and overseen at the school in Orpington over a seven year-period by former headmaster Aydin \u00d6na\u00e7.\n\nIt was reversed in September when a group of parents threatened a judicial review and Mr \u00d6na\u00e7 resigned at the end of 2017.\n\nThe BBC understands Mr \u00d6na\u00e7 has been referred to regulatory body the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), but Andrew Gebbett, who has two sons at St Olave's, said he believed the DfE should have\"taken the lead\".\n\nThe DfE said it wrote to secondary schools reminding them the policy was unlawful.\n\nEducation law specialist Anita Chopra said it was usual for such referrals to be made by an employer or a parent.\n\nShe said if the TRA decided Mr \u00d6na\u00e7's case was worth investigating, he could be banned from teaching.\n\nOfficial guidance states employers, in this case St Olave's school, have a\"statutory duty to consider referral of cases involving serious professional misconduct to the TRA\", even when a teacher has resigned before they could have been dismissed.\n\nThe school said a referral was\"considered, but due to a lack of evidence was not felt appropriate\".\n\n'Weeding out'\n\nMichael Pyke, spokesman for the Campaign for State Education, said it was\"hardly surprising\"Mr \u00d6na\u00e7 was not facing any repercussions because\"he wasn't the only person who knew about this practice\". \n\n\"The DfE, the local council, the diocese - they're all complicit,\"he said.\n\nNuala Burgess, spokeswoman for campaign group Comprehensive Future, said she believed the DfE was complicit by\"indirectly forcing schools to do these things\".\n\nDfE policies placing increasing importance on league tables drove schools into\"all sorts of dubious practices, including the'weeding out' of year 12s,\"said Ms Burgess, who recently completed a doctorate into sixth form selective practices.\n\nA spokesperson for Bromley Council said it wrote to the school a day after receiving the first complaint about the exclusion policy in July 2017.\n\nThe Diocese of Rochester, which is involved in the running of the school, said it accepted the report, which it said made clear the relationship between the diocese education board, council and school needed to be better. \n\n\"This is something that is much more positive now,\"it said. \n\nThe report does not make any mention of the TRA or a possible referral.\n\n'Young lives ruined'\n\nRhonda Galpeer, whose daughter previously went to St Olave's, said:\"I can't believe [Mr \u00d6na\u00e7] has got away so easily with everything. No sanctions have been put on him.\"\n\nDebbie Hills, another parent of an ex-pupil, added:\"None of these people has been held to account, yet young lives have been ruined because all those professionals put in place to protect them all chose to do nothing.\"\n\nBefore his time at St Olave's, Mr \u00d6na\u00e7 was at Fortismere School in Haringey where he was criticised by parents for reducing provision for children with special educational needs.\n\nA group of parents were in the process of going to judicial review on behalf of their children at Fortismere, the council-commissioned report said, but he left before they could take that further, to take up his role at St Olave's.\n\n\"He resigned there too before they could take him to court,\"Ms Galpeer said.\"He has a history. He should be banned.\"\n\nThousands'off-rolled'\n\nMr Pyke and Ms Burgess agreed St Olave's was\"only the tip of the iceberg\"and the practice of\"off-rolling\"under-achieving students was widespread.\n\nIn 2017, more than 22,000 children were\"off-rolled\"from state schools before sitting their GCSE exams, according to think tank Education Datalab.\n\nThe majority of them were recorded as having transferred to\"alternative provision\"- something Mr Pyke described as a\"dubious form of education in which most children achieve nothing at all\".  \n\nMost off-rolling, Mr Pyke said, happened at schools teaching\"pupils from deprived homes, who don't have anyone to speak up for them\".\n\nHe said St Olave's\"got caught because its students' parents came from well-to-do homes\". He added it was a\"regrettable one-off, but it won't deter other schools\". \n\nMr \u00d6na\u00e7 has been approached for comment but has not responded.\nTL;DR: The government has been \"complicit\" in an illegal policy that saw a school force out pupils unlikely to achieve high grades, campaigners have claimed.\n\nArticle: By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News\n\nThe Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, where the dramatist's plays open, is offering rare backstage access leading up to the first night of Arrivals and Departures on 1 August.\n\nDevotees will watch the playwright and director in action over five days.\n\nThe theatre has had its public funding cut by 18% since 2010.\"Frankly we can do with the money,\"Sir Alan said.\n\nThe 74-year-old who will also direct Arrivals and Departures, is widely regarded as one of the UK's greatest living playwrights. \n\nSir Alan was the theatre's artistic director for 37 years before ill health forced him to stand down in 2008.\n\nHe said:\"For those who are really interested in the complex and fascinating process of creating of a production, the gradual drawing together of the multiple and varied skills and crafts involved in this, here's an opportunity to see the process in action.\n\n\"No two productions are ever quite the same so this is essentially a unique occurrence.\n\n\"Enthusiasts get the chance not only to observe but on some occasions an opportunity to inter-react with this which, for them, is surely very special and for us, well, frankly we can do with the money to be able to continue doing it in the first place.\"\n\nFor between \u00a3750 - \u00a31,500, an Ayckbourn aficionado will get access to technical and dress rehearsals as well as discussions with Sir Alan and other members of the cast and crew.\n\nLike many other arts organisations, the Scarborough theatre is attempting to find new sources of funding as public subsidies are cut.\n\nIt is also an expensive production.

This is our emergency fund.\"\n\nThe researchers found some couples planned to change their working arrangements to escape losing the benefit.\n\n\"My husband will be going to a four-day week so that his salary falls below the cut-off, and I will go out to work that day instead,\"one mother told them.\n\n\"Not ideal by any means, but \u00a33,000 is a lot of money.\"\n\n'Fatally flawed'\n\nAlison Garnham, chief executive of CPAG, said:\"The policy was fatally flawed from the outset.\n\n\"Tinkering with the policy won't solve all the problems and will make child benefit too complex and costly to administer, so the plans should be dropped altogether.\n\n\"If the government wishes to target higher-rate taxpayers it would be simpler and fairer to do it through progressive taxation so that households without children share the burden.\"\n\nBut a spokesman for the Treasury said:\"The government has been clear that it is fair to ask those who are better off in our society to make a contribution to paying down the debts that we have built up over the last decade in Britain.\n\n\"It is not fair to ask someone earning \u00a320,000 to pay for the child benefit that goes to someone earning more than twice that much.\"\n\nThe change to child benefit entitlement is expected to save the Treasury about \u00a31bn.\n\nDetails of how the change will be introduced are expected to be revealed in Chancellor George Osborne's Budget on 21 March.\n\nOn Tuesday the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said the government would\"look at\"the way the change was administered.\n\nThe Treasury dismissed as\"pure speculation\"reports that the chancellor is considering softening the impact of the child benefit reforms on middle-income families by raising the earnings threshold at which it will be withdrawn to \u00a350,000 or even \u00a380,000.\nTL;DR: Changes to child benefit payments will leave many parents cutting back on vital necessities, a campaign warns.\n\nArticle: By Sinead GarvanNewsbeat music reporter\n\nSOAK played this festival in Brighton two years ago, when no one had really heard of her. \n\nNow, the 19-year-old is back at the seaside town as one of the acts everyone is itching to see. \n\n\"It's really weird,\"she told Newsbeat,\"but it's nice to come back and move up the ranks.\"\n\nThere are more than 300 acts will perform in bars and venues across the city over the three day festival including the likes of Slaves, The Cribs, Alabama Shakes as well as newer artists like Lion Babe, Shamir and Jack Garrett. \n\nFor many, it's their first experience of a British festival, although there's no mud.\n\n\"I played in the basement of where Rizzle Kicks were playing,\"SOAK told us about her first performance at The Great Escape. \n\n\"I have really good memories from that show and I met a lot of really nice people.\"\n\nShe explained how this festival can be a big help to emerging artists.\n\n\"I met a lot of the crew that I have now through playing this festival,\"she said. \n\n\"It was really good for me, it got me out to a much bigger audience, I was really thankful for it.\"\n\nSOAK, whose real name is Bridie Monds-Watson, has another big date coming up. \n\nHer debut album, Before We Forgot How To Dream, will be released on 1 June. \n\n\"I've had a lot of time to think about it so at this stage I just really want it out,\"she said. \n\n\"I'm excited to hear people's reaction to it. \n\n\"I am really proud of it and it's weird because it unconsciously took me four years to make, just because I was naturally writing songs.\n\n\"I like that now it is this thing that I can hold.\"\n\nMany artists say they find it hard to see an end point when they write a record, but for Bridie, she knew immediately. \n\n\"We were recording the last tracks O Brother,\"she explained. \n\n\"That's my favourite track on the record.

So I posted it on Twitter - and then it kind of built a life of itself.\"\n\nMarvyn does understand some of the disengagement from politics, saying:\"To be completely honest, I'm starting to fall a little bit out of love with all the back and forth.\"\n\nBut his solution is to use this as an opportunity to have your say.\n\n\"When things go bad you double down on the principles rather than abandon them,\"he says.\n\nThe latest figures show that Friday saw a massive spike in voter registration.\n\nOf the approximately 308,000 registrations on Friday, around 206,000 came from under-35s. That group was split equally between people aged 25-34 and people under 25.\n\nThe previous high in the last year was approximately 177,000 registrations, which was on 30 November - the day after the election was announced.\n\nMarvyn is clear that this is unlikely to have anything to do with his vial tweet:\"there's lots of grassroots organizations getting people to vote,\"he says. \n\nAlthough he was pleased to see several people replying to his tweet with screengrabs of the confirmation screen once they'd registered.\n\nThe deadline to register to vote is 26 November.\n\nMarvyn hopes that more black and Asian people sign up to vote in this election.\n\nData from the electoral commission suggests that black and Asian people are less likely to be registered to vote.\n\nAccording to their research, 25% of black people, 24% of Asian people and 31% of mixed people eligible to vote are not registered.\n\nThat's compared to the national average of 17%.\n\n\"Black and Asian minorities are definitely underrepresented.

But thank you.\"\n\nArticle: By Will RossBBC News, Enugu\n\n\"Biafra will live forever. Nothing will stop us,\"was the gist of their anthem in the Igbo language.\n\nThey were not exactly belting it out and instead of hoisting the flag up a pole, it was tied to a metal gate. But there is good reason for discretion - in the eyes of the authorities the gathering is illegal.\n\nOn 5 November, 100 men and women were arrested as they marched peacefully through the city's streets after raising the Biafran flag.  \n\nThey were all imprisoned and accused of treason but then released when the charges were dropped. It appears the government is determined to ensure any agitation for secession is not allowed to gather momentum.\n\nForty-two years after the end of the devastating civil war in which government troops fought and defeated Biafran secessionists, the dream of independence has not completely died.\n\n\"No amount of threats or arrests will stop us from pursuing our freedom - self-determination for Biafrans,\"said Edeson Samuel, national chairman of the Biafran Zionist Movement (BZM).\n\n\"We were forced into this unholy marriage but we don't have the same culture as the northerners. Our religion and culture are quite different from the northerners,\"he told the BBC.  \n\nThe group broke away from the better-known Movement For The Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (Massob).\n\nThe 1967-70 civil war threatened to tear apart the young Nigerian nation. Ethnic tensions were high in the mid 1960s.  The military had seized power and economic hardship was biting.\n\nWith the perception that they were pushing to dominate all sectors of society - from business to the civil service - and while they were prominent in the military, the Igbo people were attacked.\n\nThousands were killed, especially during the clashes between northerners, who are mostly Muslim, and Igbos. To save their lives, Igbos fled en masse back\"home\"to the east.\n\n\"People used to meet fuel tanker drivers who allowed them to hide inside the tankers - some survived that way,\"remembers Igwe Anthony Ojukwu, the traditional ruler of Ogui Nike in Enugu State.\n\n\"As we were licking our wounds\u2026 it dawned on us that we could not just stay at home as they would come and fight us and that would mean... extinction,\"he said, adding that this prompted the move to declare Biafra independent.\n\nToday on the streets of Enugu you can hear songs about the war.  Booming out from a stall selling CDs and DVDs I heard a song praising the late Chief Emeka Ojukwu - the man who raised the Biafran flag in 1967 and was the leader of the breakaway nation that existed for 31 troubled months.\n\n\"It was very terrifying. In the market place you hear a bang and you find limbs flying, people lying dead and others running helter-skelter,\"said war veteran Chief Nduka Eya, recalling the aerial bombardment by the Nigerian forces.\n\nAt his home he showed me the small card he was given after the Biafrans surrendered.  It reads:\"Clearance certificate for members of armed forces of defunct Biafra.\"\n\n\"Naturally when you lose a war it can be very depressing but what can you do? We took it. But history shows Biafra is defunct out of surrender,\"said Chief Nduka Eya who is now the secretary general of Ohaneze Ndigbo, an umbrella group representing Igbos around the world.\n\nIn the bottom right-hand corner of the card is Olusegun Obasanjo's signature. The man who later became the president of Nigeria played a major role in the civil war, fighting on the federal government side.\n\nAlthough no-one knows the true number, more than one million people died in the war - some from the fighting but many more from the resulting famine in the east.\n\nIn an effort to repair the bruised nation, the Nigerian head of state General Yakubu Gowan spoke of\"No Victor, No Vanquished\"and also promoted a policy of Reconciliation, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.\n\n'Willing to fight'\n\nBut to this day, many Igbos complain that they were punished economically after the war and still speak of being marginalised. The fact that no Nigerian president has come from the east is a source of much rancour.\n\nThe prospect of an independent Igboland now seems impossible, especially as secessionists would want the area's lucrative oil fields.  \n\nWhile those publicly clamouring for independence are a very small minority, it is not hard to find young people who feel they would be better off as a separate nation. This ought to be of great concern to the government of Nigeria.\n\n\"If this present government does not have the solution for us upcoming youth here, I'd rather the nation breaks,\"said one young man playing football in Enugu near a statue referred to as\"The Unknown Soldier\"holding a gun aloft.\n\n\"We are willing to fight for our rights. Without sacrifice there will be nothing like freedom.  We have to pay the price if we want independence and we are ready to do that again,\"he added.\n\n\"Islams (sic) don't want the east to rule the country and our opportunities and rights are denied so we are better off as an independent Biafra sovereign nation.  Nothing is impossible,\"another man in his 20s added.\n\nThe renowned Nigerian author Chinua Achebe recently released his memoirs of the war entitled\"There Was a Country.\" The book includes an insight into what life was like for his family fleeing the city of Lagos and heading east.\n\nHis account has angered some - especially non-Igbos - and has caused a stir in the Nigerian media as well as on the internet where there are plenty of reminders that ethnic divisions still run deep.\n\nTowards the end of his book Achebe asks:\"Why has the war not been discussed, or taught to the young, over 40 years after its end?\n\n\"Are we perpetually doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past because we are too stubborn to learn from them?\"\n\nToday Nigeria faces massive security challenges - top of the list being the Islamist insurgency in the north that many Nigerians believe is being fuelled by politicians.\n\nMany would argue that some of the root causes of the civil war were also triggers of the rebellion in the north as well as the militancy in the Niger Delta.\n\n\"Three words - injustice, inequality and unfair play,\"says Chief Nduka Eya who, like Achebe, believes it is essential for young Nigerians to learn about the war.\n\n\"If you think education is expensive try ignorance,\"he says.\n\n\"Ignorance is a very damaging disease. Our boys and girls need to know what actually happened.'Why did my father go to war?'  Someone in the north will ask:'Why did we go to fight them?'\"\n\nSitting on his throne and holding his ox tail staff of office, Igwe Anthony Ojukwu calls for the war to be studied in schools.\n\n\"The experience of Biafra should be shared so that people outside Biafra will know when they are cheated and when they should start to fight for their own destiny,\"says the traditional ruler. \n\n\"The risk of not studying Biafra is that we will continue to subdue the subdueables no matter how justified they are in their demands.  We will continue to live a life where the stronger animal kills the other,\"he says, although he stresses that he is against further efforts to secede.  \n\n\"I think it is important that Nigeria stays together.  Those who are singing for disintegration are doing so for selfish ends.\"\n\nForty-two years after the war, a beer has just been launched in eastern Nigeria.  The choice of name,\"Hero\", and the logo on the bottle of a rising sun similar to the one on the Biafran flag were no accident. \n\nThese days\"Bring me a Hero\"is a popular call in the bars of Enugu where people have not entirely given up on the dream of raising a glass to\"independence\".\nTL;DR: In a quiet, dusty and fairly secluded corner of Enugu city, south-eastern Nigeria, a group of men unfurled a homemade flag and then sang.\n\nArticle: By Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC News\n\nThe party's current policy is to oppose Theresa May's deal, then call for an election - and only if that doesn't happen should other options be considered.\n\nThese would include (but are not limited to) what the party calls a\"public vote\"on Brexit.\n\nBut some members are becoming more vocal in demanding the leadership speed up calls for a new referendum.\n\nLabour's international policy commission - which consists of shadow cabinet members, trade unionists and rank and file activists - discussed Brexit for two hours on Wednesday afternoon. \n\nThe commission doesn't have the power to change policy but it heard party activists' concerns.\n\nI understand more than 5,000 Labour members posted submissions to it.\n\nI have sifted through some of these - and here is a flavour.\n\nLabour members' voices\n\nA party member called Margo Sheridan declares:\"It's now crunch time - a large majority of Labour members now want a new referendum.\"\n\nIf that doesn't happen, she says:\"It would break my heart to leave the Labour party after 42 years, but I would have no other choice.\"\n\nA councillor, Andrew Prenter, says he is\"in despair over the leadership's strategy on Brexit\".\n\nAnd an activist called John Newham says:'Given the likelihood of parliament being unable to agree on the PM's deal, Labour should seize the initiative and propose a second referendum.\"\n\nMany more contributions are in a similar vein.\n\nLabour sources point out that only around 1% of Labour's mass membership have made these views known to the policy commission.\n\nAnd we certainly should not assume that all of the despairing comments are spontaneous.\n\nThe People's Vote campaign has been encouraging its Labour members to press the party leadership to support a new referendum. \n\nThese campaigners are often dismissed by those close to Jeremy Corbyn as\"centrists\"or\"Blairites\".\n\nBut some on the Left - who otherwise strongly support Mr Corbyn's leadership - say fellow activists are feeling disheartened by the reluctance of the leadership to call for a new referendum.\n\nMichael Chessum, from left-wing campaign group Another Europe Is Possible. told me:\"Labour's leadership has to understand that I as a left-wing activist, and other left-wing activists in Momentum, are very worried about the threat to the Corbyn project if Corbyn spins so far away from his members. \n\n\"I think there is pain for Labour whatever direction we go now,  but we have to go back to the people and if Corbyn does that, it will save the entire situation.\"\n\nBattles in the branches\n\nMichael Chessum expects about 200 of Labour's local constituency parties to debate Brexit policy this month.\n\nHis group wants to see both a fresh referendum and a defence of the free movement of people. \n\nPolling suggests strong support for a referendum amongst rank and file Labour members, but other opinions are available. \n\nThe left-wing Campaign for Labour Party Democracy is circulating a counter-motion for discussion amongst Labour's local parties.\n\nThis is supportive of the leadership position, which prioritises an election over a public vote. \n\nAnd sources say at Wednesday's policy commission meeting, consideration was given to the views of those members who had expressed concerns about moving quickly to support a new referendum and those who wanted to make clear that the result of the 2016 vote was being respected.\n\nThere was also vocal support for the\"sequencing\"of any response to the government on Brexit - in other words pressing for an election before any other options were considered. \n\nAnd there was praise for the leadership's decision not to table a confidence vote before Christmas, instead waiting until the prime minister puts her deal to a Commons vote. \n\nTensions at the top\n\nNonetheless, there have been tensions at the top of the party over when exactly to press a vote of no confidence in the government.\n\nSupporters of a new referendum had been pushing for this to be done swiftly as they expect it, and calls for a general election, to fail.\n\nThey could then push for the party to campaign for a public vote.\n\nFor obvious reasons, opponents of a new referendum - and some shadow cabinet members want to avoid this at all costs - haven't been keen to move so swiftly.\n\nAs things stand, I am told it's likely that the two positions will be reconciled. \n\nAs parliament today has, in effect, asked for the prime minister to come back with a Plan B within just three working days of her deal going down to defeat, then this seems to be emerging as the favoured time for a confidence vote.\n\nNo dramatic change\n\nLabour MP Kate Hoey - who campaigned to leave the EU - has known Jeremy Corbyn for years. \n\nShe believes that even if Labour's confidence vote fails to bring about an election, her party leader won't rush to embrace a new referendum.\n\nShe told me:\"I think Jeremy will resist the call for a second referendum unless there is absolutely no other option. \n\n\"And those of us on the Leave side will always say there are lots of options.\"\n\nParty insiders tell me not to expect a dramatic change in policy from the Labour leader in Thursday's speech.\nTL;DR: Twenty four hours before Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn makes a speech on Brexit, some of his own activists have been pressing for a more robust stance.\n\nArticle: By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News\n\nCurrently, UK legislation is subject to rulings made by the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice. \n\nLord Neuberger said Parliament must be\"very clear\"in telling the judges what to do about decisions of the ECJ after the UK leaves the EU.\n\nHe said judges should not be blamed for misinterpretations if it is unclear.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has insisted the ECJ should have no jurisdiction over the UK after Britain leaves the EU.\n\nUK courts will continue to interpret ECJ case law - even after Brexit.\n\nLord Neuberger, who will step down as Supreme Court president next month, told the BBC that judges need more guidance on how they should do just that.\n\n\"If [the government] doesn't express clearly what the judges should do about decisions of the ECJ after Brexit, or indeed any other topic after Brexit, then the judges will simply have to do their best.\" \n\n\"But to blame the judges for making the law when parliament has failed to do so would be unfair,\"he added.  \n\nHe said all judges\"would hope and expect Parliament to spell out how the judges would approach that sort of issue after Brexit, and to spell it out in a statute\".\n\nThe ECJ is in effect the EU's Supreme Court, overseeing the application and interpretation of EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states.  \n\nWhen the UK leaves the EU, the ECJ will continue to develop law on everything from consumer rights to discrimination - from things like compensation for airline passengers to transgender rights. \n\nThe government's Repeal Bill states that UK courts do not have to pay any heed to decisions of the ECJ after the UK has left the EU - but any court\"may do so if it considers it appropriate\".  \n\nBrexiteers, such as ex-Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, want the authority of the ECJ expunged as soon as possible after Brexit. He has called the court\"an illegitimate challenge to our sovereignty\".  \n\nOpponents point out the apparent contradiction of that position, saying any British company or organisation doing business in the EU is subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ.  \n\nHistoric rulings\n\nThe EU's position document that deals with governance issues around the withdrawal agreement says all Court of Justice rulings would be enforceable in the UK.\n\nThe government has said its repeal Bill - also known as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill - will ensure that historic judgements of the ECJ will be given the same binding or precedent status in our courts as decisions of our own Supreme Court.  \n\nThese judgments extend some rights in areas including the calculation of holiday pay for UK workers.  \n\nThe Supreme Court rarely departs from one of its own decisions and so historic rulings of the ECJ will be binding upon it in almost all situations.  \n\nBut Lord Neuberger said he was more concerned about post-Brexit rulings of the ECJ, adding:\"If the UK parliament says we should take into account decisions of the ECJ then we will do so. \n\n\"If it says we shouldn't then we won't. Basically we will do what the statute says.\"\n\nLord Neuberger, who will be replaced in his position by Baroness Hale, also expressed his concerns about cuts to legal aid, which was largely removed for most family cases in 2013. \n\nHe said:\"I appreciate there are demands on government finance and money is short, but if people have a right to go to court to defend their position or enforce their rights then if they cannot do so the rule of law is undermined and we are all in a very unhappy situation.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Owen Paterson, who campaigned to leave the EU, suggested a new UK body with specialist British lawyers to adjudicate on the interpretation of EU law.\n\n\"You cannot leave the judges flapping around without clear guidance and I would suggest we set up our own body which would parallel and mirror and be in symmetry with the ECJ,\"he said.\n\nA government spokesman said:\"We have been clear that as we leave the EU, the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must come to an end.\n\n\"However, we want to provide maximum certainty so the Repeal Bill will ensure that for future cases, UK courts continue to interpret EU-derived law using the ECJ's case law, as it exists on the day we leave the EU.\"\nTL;DR: Britain's most senior judge has told the government it must provide more clarity about how UK law will be developed after Brexit.\n\nArticle: Millions of tonnes of granite were excavated at the quarry, which closed in 1971 and is credited with earning Aberdeen its Granite City name.\n\nCarterra's plans were rejected in June by Aberdeen's planning committee.\n\nHowever, a Scottish government reporter has now ruled that permission will be granted if conditions are agreed between the parties involved.\n\nThe plans are for 245 rented flats, as well as a public bistro and public promenade with viewpoints to the quarry.\n\nA spokesman for Carterra said:\"We're obviously relieved to have received the positive news, which corroborates the recommendations of ACC Planning, while imposing an extensive list of conditions on approval - all of which we

Reporter\n\nBank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. \n\nHowever, they said rates would need to rise\"earlier\"and by a\"somewhat greater extent\"than they thought at their last review in November.\n\nEconomists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May.\n\nThe value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments.\n\nHigher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy.\n\nAround 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate.\n\nInterest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England.\n\nBut for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. \n\nIn November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%.\n\nIts forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years.\n\nBut it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected.\n\n\"The Committee judges that\u2026 monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,\"minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said.\n\nThe Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth.\n\nIt also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost.\n\nAs a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November.\n\nBut it says its forecasts are based on a\"smooth\"adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\nAnalysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor\n\nToday the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return.\n\nThe cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve.\n\nThe economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today.\n\nBut not everything in the garden is rosy.\n\nIt points out that the UK economic engine still\"remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty\"which is\"the most significant influence on the economic outlook\".\n\nWe are driving along with the hand brake half on.\n\nGrowth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest.\n\nRead Kamal's blog in full\n\nRate rise timing\n\nEconomists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain.\n\n\"All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,\"said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nPaul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said:\"Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%.\"\n\nOfficial figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting.\n\nUnemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%.\n\nThe Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November.\n\nIn the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was\"almost entirely\"due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union.\n\nThe chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.\nTL;DR: The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track.\n\nArticle: Starting on Friday, the exhibition will run until 10

a car near RAF Croughton.\n\nMrs Charles was speaking after plans for a new entrance to the base were discussed in Parliament on Thursday.\n\nShe said:\"You can't describe the terror and the fear that it is going to happen again.\"\n\nAnne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official at the Northamptonshire base, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash, last August, and was able to return to her home country.\n\nSince then, she has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, but an extradition request was refused by the US.\n\nSpeaking during an adjournment debate at the House of Commons on Thursday, South Northamptonshire MP Andrea Leadsom said any plans for the base should be refused until Ms Sacoolas, 42, returns to face justice.\n\nShe called for a block on\"utterly intolerable\"planning applications at the military base, including plans for a new entrance on the same road where Mr Dunn was killed.\n\nMrs Charles said Mrs Leadsom's intervention made her\"more confident any future expansion will have to be approved by the government\".\n\nShe said the road where he son was killed was\"a B road, the wrong road to have such an exit from such a large base\".\n\nSince Mr Dunn was killed there have been a number of close calls outside the base.\n\n\"It's terrifying, it makes me feel sick,\"Mrs Charles said.\n\n\"Nobody wants to wants to believe there is going to be another American serviceman or woman allowed to come out of the base committing a crime and just getting away with it.\"\nTL;DR: The mother of a teenager killed on the road outside an American air base said it is \"terrifying\" when she hears of others almost suffering the same fate.\n\nArticle: University of Aberdeen nutritionists have devised their own turkey burger, which includes extracts of the vegetable.\n\nThey believe that beetroot - which contains antioxidants - stops the body from absorbing the'bad' fat found in burgers.\n\nMen between the ages of 21 and 60 are now being sought for a study.\n\nProf Garry Duthie, from the university's Rowett Research Institute of Nutrition and Health who is leading the research, said:\"Processed food forms a major and increasing part of our diet. Consumption of high fat convenience foods in Scotland increases year by year.\n\n\"We are looking to identify if adding a vegetable extract to processed food can actually protect the body from absorbing the'bad' fats which exist in these types of products.\n\n\"When we eat a fatty food, a process called oxidation occurs in our stomachs, where fats are transformed into potentially toxic compounds and absorbed into the body. These compounds are linked to cancer and heart disease.\n\n\"We believe that adding a vegetable extract such as beetroot, which contains antioxidant compounds, will stop this oxidation of fat in the gut, and prohibit the body from absorbing the bad fat.\"\n\nHe explained:\"We trialled a number of different vegetable extracts and found that the combination of turkey and beetroot in the burger tastes good and has the advantage of looking the same as a normal burger.\n\n\"Beetroot may also have the added health benefit of lowering blood pressure.\n\n\"Volunteers will be asked to eat both turkey burgers with and without beetroot, and we will monitor to see which compounds their body absorbs when they eat the different burgers.\n\n\"If we can identify that using a vegetable extract such as beetroot in processed food stops bad fat from being ingested, this could not only have significant health benefits for the public but also benefits for the processed food industry.\"\n\nShelf life\n\nProf Duthie added:\"When fats oxidise in the stomach and become toxic they essentially go rancid. It is this same process which causes foods to go off in a shop or supermarket over time.\n\n\"So introducing an antioxidant such as beetroot would slow down this oxidation process, and have the added benefit for the food industry of lengthening the shelf life of products.\"\n\nVolunteers interested in taking part can get in touch via 01224 438621 or B.Buchan@abdn.ac.uk\n\nThe study will take place over four separate days at the Rowett Institute in Bucksburn.\nTL;DR: Burgers could be made healthier by adding beetroot to the ingredients, Aberdeen scientists believe.\n\nArticle: The SNP became the biggest party in Aberdeen on Friday.\n\nThe SNP group is hopeful of forming an administration.

Moscow denies the allegation.\n\nWhat's in the new legislation?\n\nMembers of the US Congress wanted to turn existing sanctions, and some new ones, into law.  Both houses have Republican majorities, the same party as the president.\n\nThe bill tightens existing sanctions around the ongoing situation in Ukraine and imposes new measures including some in response to alleged hacking during the 2016 election and others that target key Russian industries such as the railways, shipping, metals and mining. It would also bring in restrictions on companies doing business with the Russian oil industry. \n\nWhy does it matter that the sanctions became law?\n\nIt means getting rid of sanctions becomes much harder, and the power to reverse the sanctions effectively moves from the hands of the president to Congress. Previously, the sanctions were introduced as executive orders, which any president has the power to remove instantly.\n\nUnder the new law, Congress must approve any request from the president to ease the financial penalties detailed in the bill.  In order to waive individual sanctions, a president would need to submit a report to Congress outlining why it is in the national interest to take that action.\n\nHow has Russia responded?\n\nThe Russian government retaliated to the sanctions by telling Washington to reduce the number of its staff at the US embassy in Russia and seizing properties used by diplomatic officials. The US government will have to cut 755 staff to meet the capped figure of 455. \n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the White House would support tough sanctions on Russia until the situation in Ukraine was\"fully resolved\". Without a clear end in sight, that could mean a long time. \n\nIn a Facebook post, the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said the law ended any hopes of improving relations between Moscow and Washington. \n\nWhy are some European countries unhappy with the planned changes?\n\nThe law signals a departure from a joint EU-US approach to Russian sanctions. And some European countries have economic concerns because the new law could penalise European companies that invest in big Russian infrastructure projects such as the new Nord Stream II pipeline to transport gas between Russia and Germany. \n\nThe German Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said this part of the new sanctions programme would add a new negative dimension to US-European relations and Europe's energy supplies were\"a matter for Europe, not for the United States\".\n\nBut Germany is said to be pushing for EU sanctions against Russia to be stepped up, according to diplomatic sources quoted in Brussels.\n\nThe government in Berlin is said to want four Russian nationals and businesses added to the European bloc's sanctions list after it was revealed gas turbines made by German technology company Siemens had been illegally shipped to Crimea.  \n\nSiemens said it had\"credible information\"that its equipment had been diverted from its original destination.  \n\nAny change in sanctions would have to be agreed by all 28 EU member states.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nFollow us on Twitter\nTL;DR: US President Donald Trump has signed a significant piece of legislation to punish Moscow for alleged interference in last year's election.\n\nArticle: Over the next two weeks, the relatives of the 22 people killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing will provide a personal insight into the lives of their loved ones and how their lives were changed forever. \n\nA slideshow of photographs documenting Megan's life were shown on screen as the family's lawyer read out a statement from her loved ones. \n\nHer parents Michael and Joanne and brother Bradley were present as their\"pen portraits\"were read aloud. \n\nMegan was born prematurely on 21 March 2002, weighing 4Ib 3oz.\n\nShe was the second child to her parents Michael and Joanne Hurley, who recalled how they were\"filled with joy\"on her arrival.\n\nAs a young child,\"people were forever commenting on her striking features and adorable smile,\"her parents said. \n\nMegan, from Liverpool, settled into Halewood CE Primary School with ease and made friends that she would remain in touch with for the rest of her life.\n\n\"Her school reports were flawless each year,\"her parents remembered, adding how one teacher told them\"if we had a school full of Megans, what a school we would have\".\n\nAfter gaining\"brilliant results\"in her SATs, Megan started at Halewood Academy, making many more friends along the way. \n\nHer parents remember how Megan was growing into a\"beautiful young lady, living her life to the fullest,\"adding she had a\"lust for life and loved to have fun\".\n\nDuring her\"pen portrait\", they talked of the milestones she will miss: her school prom, her wedding, a career and being a mother.\n\n\"Since the horrendous day in May 2017 our lives have been ruined for forever,\"her family added.\n\n\"Our hearts have been shattered into a million pieces.

In June this year a woman in the Perm region was given a six-year jail term for trafficking 23 women to Bahrain for prostitution.\n\nAt the trial it emerged that Olga Goryachikh, from the Urals town of Chaykovsky, had received 1m roubles (about \u00a313,000; $17,195) for each woman trafficked, Russia's Kommersant daily reported. She had paid six other gang members from that income.\n\nGoryachikh gave details of the gang's operations, in a confession to police. \n\nThe investigation enabled Russian police to locate other gang members in Bahrain.\n\nRussian police were tipped off about the criminal network after two women managed to flee after 18 months of sex slavery in Bahrain and returned to Russia, Kommersant reported.\nTL;DR: Two Russian women accused of enslaving women for sex work in Bahrain have been deported to Russia from the Gulf state.\n\nArticle: The letter states the lack of progress over the planned bypass is a major concern and frustration.\n\nThose who have supported the letter to Stewart Stevenson include the chamber of commerce and harbour board. \n\nA Transport Scotland spokeswoman said they were fully committed to investing in the north east infrastructure.\n\nHowever she said a number of factors - including a legal challenge to the bypass - have meant significant delays to the timetable.\n\nThe bypass is aimed at creating a fast link to the north, west and south of Aberdeen.\nTL;DR: North east business leaders have signed an open letter to Scotland's transport minister over fears about delays to projects including the Aberdeen bypass. \n\n\n\nArticle: More than 129,000 people live with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Scotland, according to Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland. \n\nBut it claims waiting times for rehabilitation vary from three to four weeks in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to up to 29 weeks in Ayrshire and Arran. \n\nThe Scottish government said it knew the importance of the treatment.\n\nIt said pulmonary rehabilitation was a key recommendation of its national clinical guidelines, which it expected NHS boards to follow. \n\nPeople with COPD experience breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety but rehabilitation is said to improve their health, although it remains an incurable disease.\n\nChest Heart & Stroke Scotland wants a\"right to rehab\"to be introduced, including investment and leadership in tackling the availability of pulmonary rehabilitation to make sure people receive the best possible treatment.\n\nIt pointed to average waiting times for the rehabilitation in 2017/18. \n\nWaiting times for NHS Lothian stand at 10 weeks, while it is 14 to 23 weeks in Grampian, 8.5 in Tayside, 12 to 24 weeks in Fife and eight to 16 weeks in the Highlands.\n\nThe charity also found that the numbers of people being referred to pulmonary rehabilitation range across health boards from 2% to 21% of people who would benefit.\n\nAnxiety and isolation\n\nJane-Claire Judson, the charity's chief executive, said: \"These new figures show that there isn't universal and equal access to pulmonary rehabilitation across Scotland.\n\n\"This needs to change. That's why we are urging the Scottish government to take action.\n\n\"Behind these figures are missed opportunities to help people live a fuller life.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that so many people are missing out on pulmonary rehabilitation. We know chest disease can impact on every aspect of people's lives.\n\n\"Breathlessness and fatigue can lead to anxiety and mental health problems which in turn can cause isolation. It is essential that people get the support they need.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said:\"We recognise pulmonary rehabilitation is an important element of respiratory disease care, with its well-established evidence base helping support self-management and reduce exacerbation and hospital admissions.\n\n\"Pulmonary rehabilitation is a key recommendation in national clinical guidelines, which we expect NHS boards to follow, and access to it will form an important part of our Respiratory Care Action Plan for Scotland which will be published next year.\"\nTL;DR: Treatment for people with chronic chest disease has been described as a \"postcode lottery\" by campaigners.\n\nArticle: His departure brings to a close his 32 years on the flagship show, during which time he built a reputation as a tenacious interrogator of politicians.\n\nThursday's programme will feature interviews with former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair.\n\nBBC director general Lord Hall said public figures would breathe\"a sigh of relief\"at Humphrys' departure.\n\nDescribing him as\"a journalistic great\", the director general wrote in The Daily Telegraph:\"He is driven by a profound sense of justice and a deep distrust of authority.
