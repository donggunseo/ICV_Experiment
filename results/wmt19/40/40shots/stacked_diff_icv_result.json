The original translation \"immer mehr ein Problem\" does not accurately convey the intended meaning. \"Immer mehr\" typically means \"more and more\" in a general sense, but here it would not convey the continuous growth into a larger issue. \"Wird immer ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Problem\" accurately translates \"becoming more and more of an issue\" and it fits better with the context, where a growing problem is being discussed.\nThe final answer is: Frob\u00f6se sieht auch Probleme: \"Doping wird immer ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Problem\".", "cleaned_prediction": "Frob\u00f6se sieht auch Probleme: \"Doping wird immer mehr ein Problem\".", "gt": "Frob\u00f6se sieht aber auch Probleme: \"Doping wird immer mehr ein Thema\"."}, {"input_prompt": "You are a highly proficient multilingual large language model specializing in machine translation.
